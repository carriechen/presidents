Trump\nALREADY THE WORLD'S ENERGY LEADER: The United States had already become the leader in cutting CO2 emissions while still leading in oil & gas production.\n* In the United States, energy related carbon dioxide emissions have significantly declined since before the Paris Climate Accord was negotiated, and will continue to decline as a share of worldwide emissions, particularly when compared to other nations such as China and India.\n* The Energy Information Administration's (EIA) 2017 Annual Energy Outlook reports that, from 2005 to 2016, energy related carbon dioxide emissions fell at an average annual rate of 1.4%.\n* Emissions are projected to continue to fall from 2016 to 2040.\n* Meanwhile, the EIA reports that emissions in the developing world are expected to double their 2005 levels by 2040.\n* According to recent U.S. Energy Information Administration, the United States remained the world's top producer of oil and natural gas combined.\n* The United States continues to be a world leader in energy, but increased competition from countries like China demonstrates the need for policies that enable America to compete on a global scale.\nHARMFUL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: The Paris Climate Accord could cost the United States economy millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic output over the next several decades.\n* According to an analysis by National Economic Research Associates (NERA), meeting President Obama's commitment under the Paris Climate Accord would cost the United States nearly $3 trillion by 2040.\n* By 2040, the American economy could have 6.5 million fewer industrial sector jobs, including 3.1 million fewer manufacturing jobs.\n* Industries such as cement, iron and steel, coal, natural gas, and petroleum would be forced to cut production under President Obama's Paris Climate Accord.\nSHOULDERING THE BURDEN: Under the Paris Climate Accord, the United States would carry the burden while other countries would get the benefits.\n* Under the Obama Administration, which signed an agreement without having to deal with the economic repercussions, the United States was committed to reducing CO2 emissions by between 26 and 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.\n* Meanwhile China can continue to increase emissions for the next 13 years.\n* The United States already contributed $1 billion to a UN Green Climate Fund. This would increase to $3 billion under pledges made by the previous Administration.\nINEFFECTIVE: Even if every nation fully complied with the Paris Climate Accord, it would barely impact the climate.\n* According to researchers from MIT, if every nation that signed the Paris Climate Accord met all of their commitments until the end of the century, the impact on the climate would be negligible.\nPROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: President Trump is fulfilling his promise to the American people to stop international agreements that disadvantage the United States.\n* May 26, 2016, then-candidate Trump:\n* \"President Obama entered the United States into the Paris Climate Accords— unilaterally, and without the permission of Congress.\"\n* \"So foreign bureaucrats are going to be controlling what we are using and what we are doing on our land in our country.

Thank you very much. Thank you.\nShooting and Fire at the Resorts World Manila Casino in Manila, Philippines/U.S. Economy/The President's Travel to the Middle East and Europe/The President's Accomplishments\nI would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. We're closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates, anything happens during this period of time. But it is really very sad as to what's going on throughout the world with terror. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.\nBefore we discuss the Paris accord, I'd like to begin with an update on our tremendous—absolutely tremendous—economic progress since election day on November 8. The economy is starting to come back and very, very rapidly. We've added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy and more than a million private sector jobs.\nI've just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. It was a very, very successful trip, believe me. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nIn my meetings at the G-7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations. We're also working very hard for peace in the Middle East and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up—and you see that, you see it all over—from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren't doing so much in the form of contribution.\nOne by one, we are keeping the promises I made to American people during my campaign for President, whether it's cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court Justice, putting in place tough new ethics rules, achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border, or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. And believe me, we've just begun. The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.\nParis Agreement on Climate Change\nOn these issues and so many more, we're following through on our commitments. And I don't want anything to get in our way. I am fighting every day for the great people of this country. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord—[applause]—thank you, thank you—but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or an—really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. So we're getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great. And if we can't, that's fine. As President, I can put no other consideration before the well-being of American citizens. The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers—who I love—and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.\nThus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune.\nCompliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates. This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs—not what we need; believe me, this is not what we need—including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely. They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.\nAccording to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors: paper, down 12 percent; cement, down 23 percent; iron and steel, down 38 percent; coal—and I happen to love the coal miners—down 86 percent; natural gas, down 31 percent. The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6½ million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that.\nNot only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals. As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States—which is what it does—the world's leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters.\nFor example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years, 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.\nFurther, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America—which it does, and the mines are starting to open up. We're having a big opening in 2 weeks. Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places. A big opening of a brand-new mine. It's unheard of. For many, many years, that hasn't happened. They asked me if I'd go. I'm going to try.\nChina will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it: India can double their coal production. We're supposed to get rid of ours. Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants. In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States and ships them to foreign countries.\nThis agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States. The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement—they went wild; they were so happy—for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage. A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.\nWe have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America's poorest workers out of poverty. Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our Nation—it's great wealth, it's phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth—and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.\nThe agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. At 1-percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3- or 4-percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.\nEven if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree—think of that; this much—Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount. In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America—and this is an incredible statistic—would totally wipe out the gains from America's expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.\nAs the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning: \"The reality is that withdrawing is in America's economic interest and won't matter much to the climate.\" The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We'll be the cleanest. We're going to have the cleanest air. We're going to have the cleanest water. We will be environmentally friendly, but we're not going to put our businesses out of work, and we're not going to lose our jobs. We're going to grow; we're going to grow rapidly.\nAnd I think you just read—it just came out minutes ago, the small business report—small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people. One of the best reports they've seen in many years.\nI'm willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.\nSo if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them nonobstructionists. We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal. And we'll make it good, and we won't be closing up our factories, and we won't be losing our jobs. And we'll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris accord or something that we can do that's much better than the Paris accord. And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled. But until we do that, we're out of the agreement. I will work to ensure that America remains the world's leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.\nNo responsible leader can put the workers—and the people—of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world's top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement: It's to give their country an economic edge over the United States. That's not going to happen while I'm President. I'm sorry.\nMy job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory, and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection.\nOur tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it's doing very well. I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. The Republicans are working very, very hard. We'd love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone. But it's going very well.\nThe Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense. They don't put America first. I do, and I always will.\nThe same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. You see what's happening. It's pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.\nAt what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won't be. They won't be.\nI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests. Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation. Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they'll soon be under renegotiation. The process has begun from day one. But now we're down to business.\nBeyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund—nice name—which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America's existing and massive foreign aid payments. So we're going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we're already way ahead of anybody else. Many of the other countries haven't spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.\nThe Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion—nobody else is even close; most of them haven't even paid anything—including funds raided out of America's budget for the war against terrorism. That's where they came. Believe me, they didn't come from me. They came just before I came into office. Not good. And not good the way they took the money.\nIn 2015, the United Nation's departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as \"peanuts\" and stated that \"the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.\" In 2015, the Green Climate Fund's Executive Director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020. And nobody even knows where the money is going to. Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?\nOf course, the world's top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. America is $20 trillion in debt. Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure. Millions of our citizens are out of work. And yet, under the Paris accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of that.\nThere are serious legal and constitutional issues as well. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives. Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America's sovereignty. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. And I will.\nStaying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America's abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.\nThe risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point—as bad as it is—not an end point. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.\nAs President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people. The Paris accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risk, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. It is time to exit the Paris accord and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.\nIt is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—along with many, many other locations within our great country—before Paris, France. It is time to make America great again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Very important. I'd like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.\nScott, please.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator E. Scott Pruitt. Thank you, Mr. President. Your decision today to exit the Paris accord reflects your unflinching commitment to put America first. And by exiting, you're fulfilling yet one more campaign promise to the American people. Please know that I am thankful for your fortitude, your courage, and your steadfastness as you serve and lead our country.\nAmerica finally has a leader who answers only to the people—not to the special interests who have had their way for way too long. In everything you do, Mr. President, you're fighting for the forgotten men and women across this country. You're a champion for the hard-working citizens all across this land who just want a Government that listens to them and represents their interest.\nYou have promised to put America First in all that you do, and you've done that in any number of ways, from trade, to national security, to protecting our border, to rightsizing Washington, DC. And today you've put America first with regard to international agreements and the environment.\nThis is an historic restoration of American economic independence—one that will benefit the working class, the working poor, and working people of all stripes. With this action, you have declared that the people are rulers of this country once again. And it should be noted that we as a Nation do it better than anyone in the world in striking the balance between growing our economy, growing jobs while also being a good steward of our environment.\nWe owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship. After all, before the Paris Accord was ever signed, America had reduced its CO2 footprint to levels from the early 1990s. In fact, between the years 2000 and 2014, the United States reduced its carbon emissions by 18-plus percent. And this was accomplished not through government mandate, but accomplished through innovation and technology of the American private sector.\nFor that reason, Mr. President, you have corrected a view that was paramount in Paris that somehow the United States should penalize its own economy, be apologetic, lead with our chin, while the rest of world does little. Other nations talk a good game; we lead with action—not words.\nOur efforts, Mr. President, as you know, should be on exporting our technology, our innovation, to nations who seek to reduce their CO2 footprint to learn from us. That should be our focus versus agreeing to unachievable targets that harm our economy and the American people.\nMr. President, it takes courage, it takes commitment to say no to the plaudits of men while doing what's right by the American people. You have that courage, and the American people can take comfort because you have their backs.\nThank you, Mr. President.", "timestamp": "2017-06-01", "title": "Remarks Announcing United States Withdrawal From the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement"}

Count this as a major Trump promise kept.\" – New York Post\nTHE NEW YORK POST: \"In Ditching Paris Deal, Trump Does Right By America And The World\"\nIn quitting the Paris Accord, President Trump on Thursday did nothing to shift the course of US environmental policy — not even on carbon emissions. But he did put the world on notice that no president can unilaterally commit this nation to such far-reaching agreements. … Yet America will continue to cut its carbon emissions: They're already down by a fifth since 2000, thanks to fracking and the gradual replacement of coal plants with natural-gas ones. That's better than Europe did as it implemented Kyoto by making electricity cost twice as much as it does here. Nor did Paris make sense. As Danish economist Bjorn Lomborg notes, it entails costs of over $1 trillion a year to shave 0.36 degrees Fahrenheit off global temperatures by 2100 — a tenth the reduction it said is necessary. … America has far cleaner air and water than it did 50 years ago, and more parkland. It should continue those trends, and keep reducing its carbon emissions — democratically. What the nation won't do, thanks to the president, is devastate its own economy against the public's wishes in order to satisfy the global elite. Count this as a major Trump promise kept.\nTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL: \"Trump Bids Paris Adieu\"\nPresident Trump announced the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement on Thursday, to the horror of green elites world-wide. If the decision shows he is more mindful of American economic interests than they are, the other virtue of pulling out is to expose the fraudulence of this Potemkin village. … But amid the outrage, the aggrieved still haven't gotten around to resolving the central Paris contradiction, which is that it promises to be Earth-saving but fails on its own terms. It is a pledge of phony progress. The 195 signatory nations volunteered their own carbon emission-reduction pledges, known as 'intended nationally determined contributions,' or INDCs. China and the other developing nations account for 63% of annual global CO 2 emissions, and their share is rising. They submitted INDCs that pledged to peak the carbon status quo 'around' 2030, and maybe later, or never, since Paris included no enforcement mechanisms to prevent cheating. Meanwhile, the developed OECD nations—responsible for 55% of world CO 2 as recently as 2000—made unrealistic assurances that even they knew they could not achieve. As central-planning prone as the Obama Administration was, it never identified a tax-and-regulation program that came close to meeting its own emissions pledge of 26% to 28% reductions from 2005 levels by 2025.\nNATIONAL REVIEW: \"We'll Never Have Paris\"\nPresident Donald Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. The United States never should have been in it in the first place, and it's not even entirely clear that it ever was. In choosing American interests over Davos pieties — in the face of resistance from some within his own administration — the president here has made good on his promise to put America first. The Paris Agreement is a treaty in all but name: The European signatories put it through their usual treaty-ratification protocols, but the United States did not. President Obama went to great lengths to pretend that the treaty was something other than a treaty because he did not wish to submit it for ratification by the Senate, which was almost sure to reject it — as, indeed, the Senate would likely reject it today. In a government of laws, process matters. Substance matters, too, and here the Paris Agreement is deficient.\nINVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY: \"By Leaving Paris Climate-Change Deal, Trump Will Do U.S. Economy A 'Yuuuge' Favor\"\nClimate Change: President Trump is letting it be known that he intends to take the U.S. out of the Paris Accords on climate change. While it will no doubt cause a political flap, it's a smart move that ends the cynical charade of limiting climate change by shrinking our economy. … This is another reason why Donald Trump's election has been so fortunate; had all this taken place under President Hillary Clinton, the U.S. would today be saddled with economy-killing regulations that would have destroyed our prosperity and cost us hundreds of billions of dollars a year for nothing in return.\nWASHINGTON TIMES: \"The Promise To Keep\"\nPresident Trump said during the campaign last year that the rest of the world is laughing behind America's back, and never would that be more evident than if the United States becomes a party to the ruinous Paris accord. This is a shakedown of the American taxpayer for a treaty that will do nothing to save or clean up the planet. This might be worth the cost, as enormous as it would be, if there were a genuine environmental benefit. Alas, there is none. China and India — by far the two largest polluters — have announced they will build hundreds of new coal-fired plants to power economic expansion. They're not about to let climate change concerns stall their economic engines. China first, India first, and no apology. But America is expected to sign a treaty that would decree that for every coal plant closed in Ohio or shuttered in West Virginia, China and India would build 10 new plants.", "timestamp": "2017-06-02", "title": "Press Release - Editorial Boards Praise President Donald J.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=125935", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:41 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. EPA Administrator Pruitt is here today to deliver a brief statement on the President's announcement yesterday and answer any questions you have regarding the Paris Climate Accord and the decision the President reached yesterday. As always, I ask that you keep your questions for Administrator Pruitt on topic. Once he's finished I'll be back up here to answer some questions of the day. I would note that he has a flight to head to, so we're going to try to keep this relatively short on his end.\nWith that, Administrator Pruitt.\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: Thanks, Sean.\nIt's good to be with you this afternoon. And I want to first begin by saying that the President made a very courageous decision yesterday on behalf of America. He put America's interest first with respect to environmental agreements and international discussions. I really appreciate his fortitude. I really appreciate his leadership in this matter.\nThe discussion over the last several weeks has been one of a thoughtful deliberation. He heard many voices, voices across a wide spectrum of vantage points. And the President made a very informed and, I think, thoughtful and important decision for the country's benefit.\nWhat we have to remember when it comes to the environmental agreements and international agreements with respect to things like the Paris Agreement is we have nothing to be apologetic about as a country. We have reduced our CO2 footprint to levels of the early 1990s. And in fact, from 2000 to 2014, we reduced our carbon footprint by over 18 percent. And that's been largely accomplished through innovation and technology, not government mandate. So when we look at issues like this, we are leading with action and not words.\nI also want to say that exiting Paris does not mean disengagement. In fact, the President said yesterday that Paris represents a bad deal for this country; it doesn't mean that we're not going to continue the discussion. To export our innovation, to export our technology to the rest of the world, to demonstrate how we do it better here is, I think, a very important message to send.\nHe indicated that he's going to either reenter Paris or engage in a discussion around a new deal with a commitment to putting America first. The President said, routinely, he's going to put the interest of American citizens at the head of this administration. That's in trade policy; that's in national security; that's in border security; that's in right-sizing Washington, D.C. And he did that with respect to his decision yesterday on Paris.\nSo, with that, I'd be glad to answer any questions you might have. And I don't know your names, so you'll have to give me that. I'll just point to you, and we'll just go from there.\nYes, ma'am. Your name?\nQ: It's Mary Bruce with ABC.\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: Hello, Mary.\nQ: Thank you. I have a two-part question. I was hoping you could clear this up once and for all. Yes or no, does the President believe that climate change is real as a threat to the United States?\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: You know, what's interesting about all the discussions we had for the last several weeks have been focused on one singular issue -- is Paris good or not for this country? That's the discussions I've had with the President. So that's been my focus. The focus remained on whether Paris put us at a disadvantage, and in fact, it did. It put us at an economic disadvantage.\nYou may not know this, but Paris set targets of 26 to 28 percent. With the entire agenda of the previous administration, we still fell 40 percent short of those targets. It was a failed deal to begin with. And even if all of the targets were met by all nations across the globe, it only reduced the temperature by less than two-tenths of one degree.\nSo that is something that the President focused upon with respect to how it impacted us economically and whether they were good environmental objectives that were achieved as a result of Paris. His decision was, no, and that was the extent of our discussions.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: On climate change, yes or no?\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: Yes, ma'am.\nQ: Two-tenths of one percent, a statistic that you're citing -- the MIT scientists who helped with that report say that Trump \"badly misunderstood\" the findings of that report, and that, in fact, if we take no action, temperatures can rise a devastating five percentage points. So, specifically, what other science did the President rely on.\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: There were other stories that were published at the time. The MIT study was something that, as you indicated, showed two-tenths of one degree. They didn't have a corner on the market as far as the studies at that time. There were many at that point. We can provide those to you.\nWhat's clear about Paris, what's clear is that if you go back and look at the criticism that was being levied against the Paris Agreement, it wasn't just from folks in this country who wanted it to be ratified, or were critical of processes, the environmental left was very critical of Paris. In fact, James -- what was -- James Hansen is an individual who said at the time it was a fake and a fraud. And the general counsel of the Sierra Club said the same thing. So if you go back and read the media accounts, there was much criticism, largely because it did not hold nations like China and India accountable.\nAs you know, China did not have to take any steps of compliance until 2030. India had no obligations until $2.5 trillion of aid were provided. And Russia, when they set their targets, they set 1990 as their baseline, which allowed them to continue emitting more CO2. In this country, we had to have a 26 percent to 28 percent reduction in greenhouse gases, which represented the Clean Power Plan and the entire Climate Action agenda of the past administration.\nYes, sir.\nQ: I'd like to go back to the first question that was asked that you didn't answer. Does the President believe today that climate change is a hoax? That's something, of course, he said in the campaign. When the pool was up in the Oval Office with him a couple days ago, he refused to answer. So I'm wondering if you can speak for him.\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: I did answer the question because I said the discussions that the President and I have had over the last several weeks have been focused on one key issue -- is Paris good or bad for the country. The President and I focused our attentions there. He determined that it was bad for this country. It hurt us economically' it didn't achieve good environmental outcomes. And he made the decision to reject the Paris deal.\nYes, right there. Yes, sir.\nQ: Thank you. Given the fact that you and other administration officials haven't been able to outline the President's views on climate change, why should other countries believe that the President wants to negotiate a new deal in good faith?\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: As I indicated in my comments yesterday and the President emphasized in his speech, this administration and the country as a whole, we have taken significant steps to reduce our CO2 footprint to levels of the pre-1990s. What you won't hear -- how did we achieve that? Largely because of technology -- hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling -- that has allowed a conversion to natural gas in the generation of electricity. You won't hear that from the environmental left.\nAnd so we need to export clean coal technology. We need to export the technology in natural gas to those around the globe -- India and China -- and help them learn from us on what we've done to achieve good outcomes. We've led with action, not words.\nParis truly -- Paris at its core was a bunch of words committed to very, very minimal environmental benefits and cost this country a substantial amount of money and put us at an economic disadvantage.\nYes, sir. Yes, sir.\nQ: Does the President believe that -- or does the administration believe that any additional deal on carbon emissions, whether it's Paris or a subsequent deal, needs --\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: I'm sorry. I missed the first part of your question. Can you --\nQ: Does the administration believe that any deal -- whether it's a revised Paris Agreement or another carbon emissions deal -- needs congressional approval? Either as a treaty or some other form --\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: Well, I think it's clear with respect to the Paris Agreement that there are concerns by the administration. The President expressed this constitutionally in his speech yesterday. I have similar concerns that it should have been submitted to the U.S. Senate for ratification.\nI think it depends on the nature of the deal, what you actually negotiate. If we're talking about exporting innovation and technology to the rest of the globe, I would say not -- I would say that that's not something that should -- needs to be submitted to the U.S. Senate.\nI would say, however, that if you're setting targets, if you're setting emission targets that are enforceable domestically through regulation or statute, then very much so. The voice of American citizens across the country needs to be heard through the ratification process.\nYes, sir. Yes, sir.\nQ: Obviously a lot of people from the White House are not willing to answer this question of what the President's view is on climate change. So let's talk about your personal views. In March, you said, there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of human impact, and you would not agree that it's a primary contributor to global warming. Would you agree that human activity contributes at all to global warming?\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: I don't know if you guys caught my confirmation process or not, but -- it's a very intense process, by the way -- but that confirmation process -- I indicated that in fact, global warming is occurring; that human activity contributes to it in some manner.\nMeasuring with precision from my perspective, the degree of human contribution is very challenging. But it still begs the question what do we do about it? Does it pose an existential threat, as some say? People have called me a climate skeptic or a climate denier -- I don't even know what it means to deny the climate. I would say that there are climate exaggerators.\nIn fact, many of you -- I don't know if you saw this article or not, but \"The Climate of Complete Certainty,\" by Bret Stephens, that was in The New York Times talked about -- and I'll just read a quote, because I think it a very important quote from this article -- \"Anyone who has read the 2014 report of the IPCC knows that while modest, 0.8 degree Celsius warming of the Earth has occurred since 1880. Much else that passes as accepted fact is really a matter of probabilities. That's especially true of the sophisticated but fallible models and simulations by which scientists attempt to peer into the climate future. To say this isn't to deny science isn't to acknowledge it honestly.\"\nAnd I think that -- look, the debate -- what the American people deserve is a debate objective -- transparent discussion about this issue. And what Paris represents is a international agreement that put this country at a disadvantage with very little benefit environmentally across the globe.\nQ: If we just look at the --\nQ: Can I ask a follow-up question on that, sir? Why, then, is the Arctic ice shelf melting? Why are the sea levels rising? Why are the hottest temperatures in the last decade essentially the hottest temperatures that we've seen on record?\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: We've actually been on hiatus since the late 1990s, as you know.\nQ: But, sir, so there's -- when NASA says that 95 percent of the experts in this area around the world believe that the Earth is warming, and you are up there throwing out information that says, well, maybe this is being exaggerated and so forth, and you're talking about climate exaggerators, it just seems to a lot of people around the world that you and the President are just denying the reality. And the reality of this situation is that climate change is happening and it is a significant threat to the planet.\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: Let me say this, and I've said it in the confirmation process and I said it yesterday --\nQ: That's true, though, right? About the Arctic ice and the sea levels and --\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: We have done a tremendous amount as a country to achieve reductions in CO2. And we have done that through technology and innovation. We will continue to do that. We will continue to stay engaged.\nWe are part, as you know, of the UNFCCC, and that process encourages voices by some national groups and by countries across the globe. And we are going to stay engaged and try to work through agreements and achieve outcomes that put America's interest first.\nThis is not -- this is not -- a message to anyone in the world that America is somewhat -- should be apologetic of its CO2 position. We are actually making tremendous advances. We're just not going to agree to frameworks and agreements that put us at an economic disadvantage and hurt citizens across this country.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Critics argue you're putting your head in the sand, though, Mr. Pruitt. They're a little worried that you're putting your head in the sand.\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: There is no evidence of that.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Administrator. Your fellow Sooner Senator Inhofe said that while he has full confidence in the President in this, he is very nervous about lower-level career government employees in the EPA and the State Department in actually executing what it means to exit the Paris Climate Accord. As the Administrator of EPA, what do you say to your own staff?\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: What's important to know is that the President said unequivocally yesterday that the targets set in Paris, the 26 to 28 percent targets, are not enforceable and are not going to be complied with. The Green Climate Fund where the United States committed $3 billion of initial funding is not going to continue. That is unequivocally the case, and that's going to be immediate.\nNow, there are discussions that are ongoing with the Justice Department on the steps that we'll be taking to execute the withdrawal on the exit. That's something that's going to be happening over the next several weeks. But as far as the targets are concerned, as far as the Green Climate Fund, that is immediate and it's something that's clear.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: European leaders have made it very clear the deal can't be renegotiated. So how does the President renegotiate a deal when the other parties aren't willing to come to the table?\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: Well, as he indicated, whether it's part of the Paris framework or a new deal, he's -- it's either approach.\nQ: But a new deal with who, if they're not going to sit down at the table with him?\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: Well, that's up to them, right? What America -- the United States has a seat at the table. After all, we're the United States, and we are leading with respect to CO2 reduction. We have made tremendous progress. If nations around the globe want to see -- to learn from us on what we're doing to reduce our CO2 footprint, we're going to share that with them. And that's something that should occur and will occur in the future. And we will reach out and reciprocate with nations who seek to achieve that.\nQ: And just a quick follow-up. You're the EPA Administrator. Shouldn't you be able to tell the American people whether or not the President still believes that climate change is a hoax? Where does he stand?\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: As I indicated several times through the process -- there's enough to deal with, with respect to the Paris Agreement and making an informed decision about this important issue. That where our focus has been over the last several weeks. I've answered the question a couple times.\nYes, sir. Yes, sir, this gentleman right here.\nQ: Thank you. Isn't it of concern that the United States has broken a promise to 190 countries? And the President did not address that particular point. And second, you've several times raised the lowering of CO2 levels. Isn't the reason for lower CO2 levels because of blocking the smokestack spews that now are not allowed, the kind of regulations that the administration is now opposing?\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: As I indicated, largely, we have reduced our CO2 footprint through innovation and technology, not the least of which is hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.\nAnd the first part of your question? I forget.\nQ: Isn't it of concern that we broke a promise to 190 countries? And how does that help our credibility?\nADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: Well, truly, this gentleman's question back here -- if it was a promise that was enforceable and was going to obligate this country, then it should have been ratified as a treaty, right? The exposure here to us domestically was 26 to 28 percent targets that were part of an international agreement, and there are provisions in the Clean Air Act that actually allow for lawsuits to be filed domestically to compel regulation to meet those kinds of percentages.\nThis was as much about constitutional and legal concerns as anything else. And the President dealt decisively with that. But let's -- again, the important thing here is it put us in an economic disadvantage. The world applauded -- the world applauded when we joined Paris.\nAnd you know why? I think the applauded because they knew it was going to put this country at an economic disadvantage. And the reason European leaders -- going back to the question earlier -- that I think they want us to stay in is because they know it will continue to shackle our economy, though we are leading the world with respect to our CO2 reduction.\nThat's all I've got. I've got to head to the airport. Thank you very much.\nQ: Our word is not our bond?\nQ: Why did you celebrate at a French restaurant last night? Was that a symbolic gesture?\nMR. SPICER: Thanks, Mr. Pruitt.\nEarly this morning, in the May jobs report, it was released showing that Americans seeking jobs are having more success finding them than at any point in the last 16 years. There's a lot of positive signs coming out of the job market. Over 600,000 private sector jobs have been added since the President took office. The key U6 unemployment rate, which gives a broader look at both unemployment and under-employment, fell a full percentage point since the President took office in January. Long-term unemployment is down by 187,000 since the President took office. And America's miners and drillers are getting back to work, with that sector showing job growth for the second -- the seventh straight month.\nThe President is not going to stop until every American who wants to work can find meaningful employment. That's why we're working tirelessly on policies that will keep the economy growing -- with a tax plan that will leave more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans and making it easier for businesses to thrive; an infrastructure initiative that will generate $1 trillion of investment and put Americans back to work rebuilding our nation's crumbling roads and bridges; repealing and replacing the job-killing Obamacare with a system that encourages competition and drives prices down; and a systematic regulatory reform to reduce unnecessary burdens on manufacturing and other key industries, aiming for the most far-reaching rollback since the Reagan years.\nYou can expect the President to be focusing even more on jobs this month and holding events in Washington and outside, pushing his pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda.\nLater this afternoon, the President is going to be signing two bills that were both passed with bipartisan support that help protect those who protect us, our nation's veterans and public safety officers.\nFirst the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act of 2017, which was co-sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. It was unanimously passed by the Senate last month. It will reduce the unacceptable backlog of families awaiting approval of survivor benefits in public safety officers that were killed in the line of duty.\nThe second is the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act, which was co-sponsored by Senator John Cornyn and Senator Amy Klobuchar, which also unanimously passed the Senate, and assists state and local law enforcement in adding veterans to their forces by prioritizing the Department of Justice funding to law enforcement agencies that is used to hire veterans. It's critical that we support our veterans and the loved ones of those who have paid the ultimate price while protecting our communities.\nThe President is glad to be signing these important bills today, and there will be a pool spray at the top of that shortly.\nAlso in Washington today, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos visited the Eagle Public Charter School this morning to show the administration's support for inclusive school environments and celebrate the launch of the Department of Education's new Individuals with Disabilities Act.\nAt the State Department, Secretary Tillerson met this morning with the Foreign Minister of Brazil, and is departing for Sydney, Australia this afternoon, where he will join Defense Secretary Mattis to participate in the 2017 Australia-United States Ministerial Consultations. Prior to his arrival in Australia, Secretary Mattis will attend the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, where he will deliver remarks and meet with regional allies and counterparts to discuss security issues.\nWith that, I'd be glad to take a few questions.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I want to ask about the push for the travel ban to the U.S. Supreme Court. Is it fair to say that one of the reasons that the President wants to keep this going is obviously now we have a full Court impaneled, but also because it gives the White House perhaps a chance to build on some momentum, especially if you look back at yesterday? It would appear that his base was very pleased with what the President decided to do. Is that part of the calculus?\nAnd I'd also like to ask as a follow about the XL pipeline. Can you give us an update on what's happening with that in terms jobs and development?\nMR. SPICER: I think that what we've said with respect to the executive order in question has been fairly consistent since its implementation and the first court action. So last night, we asked the Supreme Court to hear this important case and are confident that the President's executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism.\nThe President is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism and until he determines that they are properly vetted and do not pose a threat or risk to the United States. That's pretty consistent with what we've talked about.\nI don't have an update -- are you talking about in terms of production for Keystone? I don't have that at this time.\nZeke.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. You were asked earlier this week about the President's personal views on climate change and whether or not he believes it's a hoax. You said you hadn't had a chance to have that conversation with him. Now it's been 48-72 hours. What does the President actually believe about climate change? Does he still believe it's a hoax? Can you clarify that? Because apparently nobody else at the White House can.\nMR. SPICER: I have not had an opportunity to have that discussion.\nBlake.\nQ: Don't the American people deserve to know what the President believes on such an important issue?\nMR. SPICER: I think that Administrator Pruitt pointed out that what the President is focused on is making sure that we have clean water, clean air, and making sure that we have the best deal for the American workers.\nBlake.\nQ: Trey.\nMR. SPICER: Trey. Sorry.\nQ: No worries. (Laughter.) Quick question for you related to the Paris climate agreement. Why does the President feel it's important to continue to reduce carbon emissions and export clean energy technology?\nMR. SPICER: I think he understands the importance of clean air and clean water, as I just mentioned, and a healthy environment, but also doing so in a way that provides American workers and our economy a way to grow. But obviously, as Administrator Pruitt pointed out, we've got a lot of technology that we can export to other countries and help them.\nQ: Just a quick question as it relates to climate change. Very simple definition of climate change is a change in the Earth's weather patterns. The EPA Administrator said today that he does feel there is some value to the studies that say the Earth is warming somewhat. Does the President share the EPA Administrator's thoughts on this topic? And why has the administration sort of backed away from using the words \"climate change\"?\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I have not -- as I mentioned to Zeke, I have not had an opportunity to specifically talk to the President about that.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Yesterday the President painted a pretty dire economic picture if the United States were to stay in the Paris Accords, saying it would be disastrous for the U.S. economy. And yet dozens of the top CEOs of American corporations lobbied the President in order to stay in the Paris Accords. Why would the President argue that this is bad for the economy if all those CEOs are saying, you know what, we need to do this? Is the President right about the economic forecasts and all those private sector leaders wrong?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President took input from a lot of individuals and there were other sectors that were very concerned about the implementation of it. Frankly, I think there were some companies and some organizations that are among those that you mentioned that, while they maybe wanted to stay in, also expressed concern about the target levels.\nBut at the end of the day, the President's number-one priority is to get the best deal for the American people. This is who they elected last year. This was -- I think one of the things that we've got to remember is that the President was very clear on the campaign trail about his position on this, but he was also clear that he was going to negotiate the best deal for the American people. And if you look at all of the deals that we have -- whether they're the trade deals or Paris -- the President has made it very clear that he's committed to getting the best deal for America, America's workers, America's manufacturers.\nQ: Is the President going to replace Elon Musk and Bob Iger on the President's advisory council?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know at this point.\nJim.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. The President's critics are claiming that pulling out of the accord will lift China as a global leader. Do you agree with that sentiment? What does the White House have to say about that?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think -- I think part of the reason that the President said it was a bad deal yesterday is because countries, including China, were not making substantial progress in reducing their carbon footprint. They weren't doing enough and America was carrying the load. So I think by negotiating a better deal, hopefully we can get a better result for our country and the world.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Yesterday, President Macron of France delivered a sharply worded speech in English attacking the President on the climate change decision, saying it is bad for all of our children. And he specifically called on scientists to come and move to France. What's the President's response to President Macron?\nMR. SPICER: I think that the President has made it clear since day one that his job is to protect the interests of this country and our citizens. As he said yesterday, he was elected to represent Pittsburgh, not Paris.\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. The Washington Post has reported that the administration is considering returning these properties in Maryland and New York to Russia. What is the reason for that? And what would the White House have to see before giving back those properties?\nMR. SPICER: The State Department issued comments on that earlier saying, \"The U.S. and Russia have reached no agreements. They're projecting negotiations further along than they are.\" So the State Department is the lead on that, and they've been very clear where we stand on that.\nCharlie.\nQ: Has the President been following the Kathy Griffin meltdown? And does the family want a personal apology for the beheading photo?\nMR. SPICER: Does what?\nQ: Does the family want a personal apology from Kathy Griffin after the beheading photo?\nMR. SPICER: Yes, the President, the First Lady, and the Secret Service have all made it very clear their view on those thoughts.\nSteve.\nQ: Sean, it's been a matter of curiosity in this town for a couple of days now -- is the White House going to evoke executive privilege to prevent James Comey from testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week?\nMR. SPICER: That committee hearing was just noticed, and I think obviously it's got to be reviewed.\nQ: So is that -- that's not a no?\nMR. SPICER: I was just saying I don't -- literally, my understanding is the date for that hearing was just set. I have not spoken to counsel yet. I don't know what that -- what they're -- how they're going to respond.\nJen.\nQ: Two questions, Sean, one on the tax bill and one on the debt ceiling. In the Rose Garden yesterday, the President said something about our tax bill is moving along in Congress very well. We've heard something about a bill being drafted in House Ways and Means. Is that what he was talking about? Or what tax bill was he referring to?\nMR. SPICER: I think, as you know, Secretary Mnuchin and Director Cohn were here a couple weeks ago laying out the broad principles of what they look to see in legislation. They've had several discussions, both in the House and the Senate, bipartisan and industry groups. And I think that the reception that the President's initiative has received in both chambers is moving along very well with leadership and rank-and-file members.\nQ: And then on the debt ceiling, we've been getting some mixed messages from administration officials on whether you'd like to see a clean debt bill or whether you'd be -- can you explain what the President's feeling is on whether he'd like to see riders attached on a decrease in spending or whatever? What is his feeling?\nMR. SPICER: I think both Secretary Mnuchin and Director Mulvaney have weighed in on this. This is something that we're going to work with Congress on. So we're not there yet; it's something that our team is going to continue to work with them on.\nJessica.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two questions. Number one, when we heard the Administrator talk about this decision on the Paris Climate Accord he said it's not a signal that the U.S. wants to disengage on climate policy. So what are the steps that the administration is taking to engage internationally on climate?\nAnd secondly, as you well know, climate has been a key part of cooperation between the U.S. and China. Will you try to replace that very important sort of intersection of interest with something else? Will you continue to do some technological cooperation on clean energy, for example, with the Chinese? Do you have any thoughts on that?\nMR. SPICER: Well, this is a decision that was just made yesterday afternoon, and I think the President is going to engage both with domestic stakeholders -- he mentioned in the speech yesterday he looks forward to talking to leaders in both parties about a way forward and reasonable ways in which we can engage in that. And then he'll obviously talk -- continue to talk to world leaders. But that's a process that has to evolve.\nQ: And on China?\nMR. SPICER: What's that?\nQ: And on China? The relationship with China, the point of cooperation -- have you guys given some thought to how you'll manage? Because the model was, you manage tensions with China as the U.S. government by having areas of cooperation, and this was previously an area of cooperation. There's obviously other areas that the White House is working on now with China, but do you envision some other cooperation on the area of climate with the Chinese government?\nMR. SPICER: Well, the relationship that President Trump has established with President Xi has been quite remarkable. He's talked about it very clearly. And it's a model in which they'll continue to build their relationship and talk about issues, whether it's this or North Korea or other areas -- economic areas that they're going to work together on.\nSo I think that the great thing about this issue is that the relationship that the President has and continues to build with President Xi is one that will allow them to move forward.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. In a recent statement by Senator McCain, he said that Vladimir Putin is a greater threat to the United States -- security of the U.S. than ISIS. Has the President had any conversation with you about that comment?\nMR. SPICER: No, he hasn't.\nQ: Sean, thank you. Secretary Mnuchin has said that he wants the debt ceiling raised before the August recess, that we're going to run out of money by then. This morning -- he wants it clean as well. This morning, Gary Cohn said that the administration was willing to do whatever with Congress to get it passed before August, and the Freedom Caucus has said they want spending cuts. So what does this look like? It doesn't sound as if the Treasury Secretary is going to get a clean bill. What is the administration willing to take as far as spending cuts to get the debt ceiling raised?\nMR. SPICER: I think that was the nature of what Jen was asking, and I think that is a conversation that our team is going to have with congressional leaders and other stakeholders, Freedom Caucus and other members, about what it's going to take. I think there's bipartisan recognition that we need to get that done. And so Secretary Mnuchin, Director Cohn, Director Mulvaney and other members of the team will continue to work with congressional leaders to figure out what it takes to get it done.\nApril.\nQ: Sean, could you tell me, how is the President dealing with the fact that there are several mayors -- many mayors -- from a bipartisan group, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, who are against the President's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement? How does this President move forward with what he's saying about making coal great again and taking the -- walking away from the economics of clean energy, and then walking out of Paris, when you have mayors who are saying, we're going to continue with the Paris Agreement?\nMR. SPICER: Well, if a mayor or a governor wants to enact a policy on a range of issues, they're accountable to their own voters and that's what they should do. We believe in states' rights, and so if a locality, a municipality or a state wants to enact a policy that their voters or their citizens believe in, then that's what they should do.\nBut I will say that -- with respect to elected officials, there was, I think, a large contingent of officials at every level of government that were very pleased with the President's decision yesterday and applauded him for that.\nQ: -- bipartisan group of Republican and Democratic mayors who are very upset by this.\nMR. SPICER: And we have some bipartisan support for it.\nQ: Okay. And last topic -- there are a number of reports on hate crimes. Nooses have been found at the museum -- the new museum the President toured, the African American History and Culture Museum. And also there was a very negative word, one of the worst that you could say, spray-painted on LeBron James's home. What is the President saying about this? Specifically, people are saying over the last 130-plus days people are feeling that there has been a divide that is perpetuated from this White House.\nMR. SPICER: Well, I would respectfully disagree with the premise of that. I think we need to denounce hate in any form, in any act. And this President made it clear from election night to his inauguration that he wants to unite this country and move it forward.\nKaitlan.\nQ: Thank you. Did Secretary of State Rex Tillerson endorse withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not privy to the conversations that individuals had with the President.\nQ: We were told he wasn't at the announcement yesterday.\nMR. SPICER: I don't know.\nQ: Can you clarify the nature of the conversations that Jared Kushner had with Russian officials and a banker in December? And what was the date of the meeting with the banker?\nMR. SPICER: I cannot. And as I mentioned the other day, we're focused on the President's agenda, and going forward all questions on these matters will be referred to outside counsel, Marc Kasowitz.\nQ: But how can you not answer questions about it when the President himself tweets about it?\nMR. SPICER: I just -- we're focused on his agenda, and all, going forward, all questions on this matter will be referred to outside counsel.\nJill.\nQ: Thanks. Firstly, noting that you're not responding to any of those questions -- if you guys are actually finding a new spokespeople or people who will respond to this, that would be helpful. Two things. Do you have any update on the search for the FBI director?\nMR. SPICER: As I mentioned yesterday -- I guess a couple days ago -- the President continues to -- has met with some candidates. When we have an update on that we'll let you know.\nQ: And you said you haven't talked to the President yet about whether he still believes if climate change is a hoax. Can you -- would it be possible for you to have that conversation with him and then report back to us at the next briefing?\nMR. SPICER: If I can, I will.\nMary.\nQ: Even though Administrator Pruitt can't say where the President stands on climate change, does it mean that members of his administration helped the President make this decision to withdraw from the Paris Accord without knowing where the President stands, without knowing whether or not he thinks climate change is real?\nMR. SPICER: My understanding is that individuals gave the President advice on the deal at hand, and he made a decision on what was best for the country and our people on the merits of the agreement.\nQ: Sean, we know that the President heard a lot of points of view on this on both sides of the issue, and there was an impression -- maybe a false impression -- that it was a difficult decision and that he was wavering. In the end, though, yesterday, he was emphatic about getting out of the agreement. In the end, was this an easy decision, or was it a close decision?\nMR. SPICER: I honestly don't know. I mean, that's what -- the President is the ultimate decider, and when he comes to make a decision -- when he gets the information that is required he lets us know that has a decision and he announces it.\nQ: One other thing. There's a lot of talk about renegotiation. Why renegotiate? The United States has the authority to simply reduce the targets. Why not just do that?\nMR. SPICER: Because the President believes that it is in our country's best interest to renegotiate the deal.\nQ: Sean, the President signed a waiver yesterday that delays a campaign promise to move the embassy to Jerusalem. I know you said that this was to not hinder any sort of peace deal. But how confident can his supporters be that this is a campaign promise that he's going to keep?\nMR. SPICER: I think when the President signed the waiver under the Jerusalem Embassy Act and delayed moving the embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, no one should consider this step in any way to be a retreat from the President's strong support for Israel and for the U.S.-Israeli relationship.\nThe President made this decision to maximize the chance of successfully negotiating a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, fulfilling a solemn obligation to defend America's national security interest. But as he repeatedly stated his intention to move the embassy, the question is not if that move happens, but when.\nQ: But he promised in the campaign to do it on day one. I mean, is there a time frame now for when he will do this?\nMR. SPICER: His ultimate goal is to get peace. And as I said, it's not an \"if,\" it's a \"when.\"\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Following up on Kaitlan's question, -- and I have a second thing after that -- is it still the administration's position, though, that Jared Kushner was in the meeting with the Russian banker as a representative of the transition, representing the President?\nMR. SPICER: As I said to Kaitlan, we're focused on the President's agenda, and going forward, all questions on these matters will be referred to outside counsel, Marc Kasowitz.\nQ: Well, something you may be able to answer directly, does the President still have confidence in Jared Kushner?\nMR. SPICER: Absolutely.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. One of the ethics waivers the White House released applied to all White House appointees concerning discussions with the news media was retroactive. Was that aimed as -- did the White House have Steve Bannon's communication with Breitbart News in mind? Was that applied retroactively to address those communications? And any response to Director Shaub's claim that if you (inaudible) retroactively you have violated the rule?\nMR. SPICER: Yes, that's correct. There's two pieces to that that are important. One is, remember, this didn't have to do with the law or regulations. This had to do with the President's pledge -- so he is the ultimate decider on that. This isn't with respect to a law or regulation. And what we discovered was that several individuals on staff had previously worked for media organizations, and in order to continue having those discussions and advancing the President's agenda and priorities, it was important to make sure that all individuals had the opportunity to be able to speak to the media about what the President was doing to make the country stronger.\nFor what it's worth, today happens to be National Leave Work Early Day. (Laughter.) I hope you all get a chance to participate and maybe you can go home -- if you participated in National Donut Day -- you can go home early. (Laughter.)\nWith that, I hope you guys take advantage of that day. Have a great weekend. Thank you.\nQ: Are you going home early? (Laughter.)\nEND 2:19 P.M.

Over the course of 9 days, Melania and I traveled to some of the holiest sites in the three Abrahamic religions and met with nearly 100 foreign leaders. Everywhere we went, my goal was to advance American interests, to build a coalition of nations to drive out the terrorists, and to unlock a future of peace, prosperity, and hope for all Americans and people around the world.\nIn Saudi Arabia, I was honored to participate in a historic summit with the leaders of more than 50 Muslim and Arab nations, where King Salman and many other leaders expressed their desire to take on a greater role in defeating terrorists who murder innocents of all faiths. At this unprecedented summit, we opened a new center to combat extremist ideology, launched a task force to block funding for terrorists, and agreed to a massive economic development deal that will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the United States. I also discussed the importance of the nations of the region taking more responsibility on migration so that more young people are part of creating a better future in their home societies.\nFrom Saudi Arabia, I traveled to Jerusalem, where I reaffirmed the unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel. There, I prayed at the Western Wall, visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and was awed by the majesty of that sacred land and the perseverance of the Jewish people. I also traveled to Bethlehem, another ancient city of wonder, where I met with Palestinian leader, President Abbas. Both President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu assured me they are ready to reach for peace.\nFrom Israel, I traveled to Italy, where Melania and I were greatly honored to visit the Vatican and meet Pope Francis. He was really wonderful, a great guy.\nThen, I traveled to two summits with our key allies: first, the NATO summit in Brussels, where nations agreed they must do more to meet their financial obligations and pay their fair share, because right now, it is not fair to the United States. But it soon will be.\nNext, I attended the G-7 summit in Italy, where we worked to improve coordination on shared security threats, achieve more fair trade that gives workers a level playing field, and agreed on the goal that refugees should be resettled as close to their home countries as possible so they can be part of the future rebuilding.\nBefore we returned home, I was delighted to conclude my trip by visiting American military families: unbelievable people, the true source of our strength. We will always protect those who protect us.\nOur first foreign trip was full of historic and unprecedented achievements. Joined by many old and new friends, we have paved the way for the new era of cooperation, one that calls upon each nation to take more responsibility to bring peace to their people, one that works together to defeat the scourge of terrorism and deliver hope to all of God's children, and one that protects American interests so we remain a strong and prosperous Nation—strong and prosperous, like never before—and a beacon of freedom and opportunity for many years to come.

Thank you all. It's a great honor, and thank our Vice President for being here. Thank you. Ivanka Trump, thank you for being here. And we have a great group behind us, incredible people. Some of you are very good friends for a long time.\nGood afternoon. It's an honor to be with you, the men and women of law enforcement, as well as two fantastic State attorneys general who are always proud to stand by the side of law enforcement officers. That's Pam Bondi and Leslie Rutledge. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nI want to thank also Chuck Canterbury, President of the Fraternal Order of Police, and Sheriff Greg Champagne, President of the National Sheriffs Association. Where are you folks? Good. Hello, man. How are you? How are you?\nSt. Charles Parish, LA, Sheriff Greg Champagne. Yes, sir. Great.\nThe President. Appreciate you being here. Really two great champions of law enforcement.\nWe are here today to reaffirm our unbreakable support for the American heroes who keep our streets, our homes, and our citizens safe. And they've been doing an amazing job under very adverse conditions. We will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. I can speak very strongly for myself and for Mike Pence, our Vice President. We are behind you 100 percent.\nEvery single day, America's law enforcement officers, firefighters, first responders, and their families make tremendous sacrifices for their communities and for their nation. When a home is threatened, when danger visits our doorstep, when innocent lives are on the line, Americans turn to their courageous officers of law enforcement because we know they are here to serve and to protect us all.\nThey sacrifice every day to keep us safe. Many have paid the ultimate price, laying down their lives to save others. Incredible people. They're true heroes, and we will always be grateful. So I want to thank you folks. That is so true.\nOur duty as Americans is to honor their service and sacrifice and to protect those who protect us. Today I am proud to sign two laws to help fulfill that very, very sacred commitment.\nFirst, the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act will help disabled officers and firefighters and families of those who fall in the line of duty quickly receive all of the benefits they so justly deserve. People have wanted this for a long time. And I'm not just talking the people behind me, I'm talking about many people that represent the people behind me: family members and friends and people that just appreciate the work they do, which is incredible.\nFor too long, injured officers have suffered, and the children of fallen officers have put their dreams of college on hold while bureaucracy delayed crucial benefits and made it impossible for their families. No longer. It's unacceptable, and it is going to end today. In fact, it's going to end in about 1 minute. This bill speeds approval times by giving State and local enforcement greater role in determining eligibility and lets applicants track the progress of their claims online. So a much, much faster situation. You're all happy with that?\nParticipants. Yes, sir.\nThe President. You know exactly what I'm talking about, right?\nParticipants. Yes, sir.\nThe President. You've been waiting for this for years.\nSecond, the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act allows the use of Federal grants to help our military veterans transition to new careers in law enforcement. America is proud of our veterans, and I think I can say double proud or triple proud. We love our veterans. And they're serving overseas, they're in harm's way, they are doing things that very few people would have the courage to do, and we will be and always will be incredibly proud to have them with us. And they've been with us like nobody, and we are going to be protecting them. They've been protecting us. We're going to be helping them right now. They've really been with us in terms of freedom, in terms of our rights, and we're right now—in terms of their rights.\nAs President, keeping Americans safe is my highest duty, and supporting law enforcement is my unwavering commitment. And I'm very proud to sign these two great bills today.\nI want to thank everybody for being here. And if you have the bills, we'll sign them. This has been years in the making, and I will tell you that this is something that I'm very happy to be doing. So congratulations, everybody. Congratulations, Pam.\nParticipants. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. This act may be cited as the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act of 2017.\n[At this point, the President signed the bill. He then handed the pen to Florida State Attorney General Pamela J. Bondi.]\nAttorney General Bondi. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. You spread it around. [Laughter]\n[Attorney General Bondi then handed the pen to K. Charles Canterbury, Jr., national president, Fraternal Order of Police.]\nCongratulations. That's a big one, right?\nAnd this is, as you know—let it be an act of the United States House. This act will be used—the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act. And that's what it is: You're heroes. And so I want to just congratulate you. This one also has been a long time in the making. You're all heroes, aren't you? I think.\nArkansas State Attorney General Leslie C. Rutledge. Sure are. They are, they are.\nThe President. You're all heroes, yes?\n[The President signed the bill.]\nThe President. That is fantastic. Who gets this pen, Mike? Who gets this pen? [The President handed the pen to Sheriff Champagne, who then passed it to Attorney General Rutledge.]\nThe President. Okay? [Applause] And thank you very much, everybody. This is slightly less controversial than yesterday—[laughter]—but yesterday was a big service to this country, I will tell you.\nThank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2017-06-02", "title": "Remarks on Signing the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act of 2017 and the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act of 2017"}

Months of codebreaking and intelligence gathered by U.S. Naval decrypt units allowed the Commander of the United States Pacific Fleet, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz to intercept enemy messages, convey misinformation that Midway was vulnerable, and prepare a counter attack against the coming assault on Midway.\nOn June 4, 1942, Americans delivered a devastating blow to the Imperial Japanese Navy. Torpedo Squadrons 8, 6, and 3 made the first wave of attacks on the enemy aircraft carriers. Despite heavy casualties, the American squadrons subjected the carriers to devastating dive-bomber attacks. By the end of the battle, the Americans sank four Japanese fleet carriers—all of which had attacked Pearl Harbor—and one heavy cruiser. The American victory at Midway gave U.S. Armed Forces time to gather strength to emerge triumphantly.\nWe honor the perseverance of the World War II code breakers that warned us of the attack on Midway, the valor of the squadrons that located and assaulted the enemy fleet, and the heroism of every U.S. Sailor, Airman, Marine, and Soldier who carried us to victory.\nThe Battle of Midway demonstrated the ingenuity and power of the American forces in the air, on land, and at sea. Seventy-five years later, we celebrate the victory that turned the tide in the Pacific.\nWe also celebrate and draw inspiration from the reconciliation and mutual respect for freedom and democracy that forged the enduring alliance between the United States and Japan. Once foes, today we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our ally Japan to ensure peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region.\nDONALD J.

That's probably right.\nAnd the Gatlin Brothers, though, they've been supporters and friends. And, Larry, from the day I met him, he was looking for a nice apartment in New York, and I said, \"Oh, that's great.\" And he actually bought one in one of my buildings. [Laughter] And he did very well with it, actually. [Laughter] But they've been friends for a long time.\nAnd the performance, I have to say—to Paul Tetreault and Jennifer Thomas, for all of the work that they do, and you put it to this event, you worked so hard. My people are telling me how hard it is and how hard you did, and I want to thank you very much. Fantastic job. Fantastic. A lot of energy. I actually commented, I said, that man's got great energy, is that right? [Laughter]\nBut not only does this theater contribute to the vibrant culture of our Nation's Capital, but it also does tremendous work in educating Americans about a leader who preserved our Nation in its single greatest hour of danger and who forged a new birth of freedom from our very bloody Civil War, and that's the great Abraham Lincoln.\nThanks in part to your work tonight, Lincoln's presence is not just here, it lives with us down through the ages. He suffered so much—his life was hard—and is remembered for his leadership, inspiration, and his enduring vision of a government of, for, and by the people.\nThanks to every single one of you who has come out tonight to support Ford's Theatre and the great work it does to keep Abraham Lincoln's memory alive. And it is a special pleasure to see my friends, Ron Perelman and Peyton Manning, both recognized for their incredible generosity and citizenship and leadership.\nRon has been an amazingly charitable person in so many ways. I've known him to give so much of himself and his family for so long. And that includes helping art and culture and making it accessible to countless Americans. So, Ronald, thank you. And I love you too, by the way. You said you loved me, and I love you too. And your parents, they'd be very proud of you, Ronald. Special people, right? Special people.\nAnd Peyton is a true champion, both on and off the field. Yes, look at that Peyton. [Laughter] He's a good guy to have as my golf partner. He's done so much good for so many young people and children. You got to see a little bit of it tonight. On behalf of the American people, Peyton, our thanks are to you and to Ronald and to Mrs. Manning, thank you very much. Very much appreciate it. And this is a great way of honoring two really extraordinary people. Thank you both very much.\nAnd of course, we're also incredibly inspired to hear the amazing work that Kevin Tuerff and Jay Winuk have done with Pay It Forward 9/11 and 9/11day.org. From one of the darkest days in American history, we were there. These citizens have carried forward a spirit of service, charity, and love of our country.\nAbraham Lincoln, to whom all Americans owe such a debt, would have taken great pleasure in the unity he would have witnessed tonight, in kindness and patriotism that is vivid and so beautifully on display right here this evening.\nAs I sat in the audience and I looked up, I said, wow, that's something. That—I've been hearing about it, I've been reading about it all of my life. And I said to Melania, look at that. It means so much to the people in this room when we see that. Incredible that you've been able to do such a great job to make it available to so many. Congratulations to everybody, and to everybody in the room, all of these incredible sponsors.\nAnd by the way, that was the A-list—right, Ronald? That's the A-list of sponsors. You don't do any better than that, do you? [Laughter]\nBut Abraham Lincoln would have loved that, more than the 150 years after this theater first opened. I mean, when you look at it, it's a place where Americans of all backgrounds, from all parts, all over the world, from both parties—can you believe that? From both parties. [Laughter] This may be one of the few times we unite. But we'll get there, you watch—can get come together and enjoy the arts in unity and in peace. So, once again, thank you to Ford's Theatre, to its really, really talented performers, and to its many wonderful, successful, incredible supporters. May God bless you, may God bless this wonderful, wonderful place, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you all very much. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-06-04", "title": "Remarks at the Ford's Theatre Gala"}

{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=125944", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:43 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. I hope you guys had a chance to get a little rest this weekend. As I'm sure you can tell, the President, as well as the rest of the administration, have a very busy week and agenda moving forward at meetings, events, both inside and outside of Washington.\nAnd with that, I'd like to bring up Secretary Shulkin to talk with you all about the big announcement he made this morning about a historic modernization of the VA's medical records system. And as a reminder, as always, I would encourage you to please be respectful and keep your questions on the topic at hand, and I will be happy to answer questions on other topics after.\nSecretary Shulkin.\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Thank you, Sarah. And I'm glad to be here today. As Sarah said, earlier today I made an announcement about the Department of Veterans Affairs decision on electronic health records. And normally that's not too exciting a decision about a product, but I have to tell you I'm very excited about this because I think this is going to make a big difference for veterans everywhere, and it's going to make a big difference for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nI wanted to say from the outset that when the President selected me to be Secretary, he made clear to me that he expected us to act with faster decisions, to act like a business, and to really make sure that we were doing the right thing to change veterans' healthcare. And that's exactly what we're trying to do today.\nI had told you when I was here last week I was going to make a decision by July 1st, and I wanted to let you know that we're coming back early and that I'm honoring that commitment.\nAnd so having an electronic health record that can follow a veteran during the course of his health and treatment is one of the most important things I believe you can do to ensure the safety and the health and wellbeing of a veteran. So that's why this is so important.\nI told Congress recently that I was committed that VA would get out of the software development business; that I did not see a compelling reason why being in the software development business was good for veterans. And because of that, I made a decision to move away from our internal product to an off-the-shelf commercial product.\nAs you may know, almost all of our veterans get to us from one place, and that's the Department of Defense. And when I went back and looked at this issue very carefully since becoming Secretary, I was able to trace back at least 17 years of congressional calls and commission reports requesting that the VA not only modernize its system but work closer with the Department of Defense. So that went all the way back to 2000.\nBut actually, to this date, the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have gone separate ways. We each have separate systems, and each are supporting separate electronic systems. And while we've been able to advance interoperability at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to the taxpayers, today we still have separate systems that do not allow for the seamless transfer of information.\nAnd I just want to expand on that a little bit being a doctor. What we are able to do with the Department of Defense over years and years and, as I said, hundreds of millions of dollars, we're able to reach each other's records right now. That's called interoperability. Or at least that's our certification. But what you're not able to do is actually work together to plan a treatment, to be able to go back and forth between the Department of Defense and VA. And so we've not been able to obtain that to this point.\nAnd so for those reasons, I decided that VA will adopt the same electronic health record as the Department of Defense, so we will now have a single system. That system is known as the MHS GENESIS system, which, at its core, is Cerner Millennium.\nThe adoption of the same system between VA and DOD is going to allow all patient data to reside in a common system so you will have this seamless link between the departments without the manual or electronic exchange of information.\nSo as Secretary, I think I'm not willing to put this decision off any longer; I think 17 years has been too long. When DOD went through its decision on electronic medical records and its acquisition process in 2014, it took them approximately 26 months to do this. And I will tell you, in government terms, that's actually a pretty efficient process. I don't think we can wait that long when it comes to the health of our veterans.\nAnd so under my authority as the Secretary of VA, I am acting to essentially do a direct acquisition of the EHR currently being deployed by the Department of Defense that will be across the entire VA enterprise. That's going to allow the seamless healthcare for veterans and the qualified beneficiaries.\nOnce again, because of the health of our veterans, I've decided that we're going to go directly into the DOD process for the next generation electronic health record.\nLet me just tell you, this is the start of the process. VA has unique needs that are different than the Department of Defense's. And for that reason, VA -- while it's adopting an identical EHR to DOD -- needs additional capabilities to maximize interoperability with our community providers. As you know, one-third of our healthcare goes outside the VA into the community. And this is critical that we can have the same interoperability with our community providers.\nWe're going to have our VA clinicians very involved in how we develop this system and how we implement it. Because in many ways, the Department of Veterans Affairs is actually well ahead of the Department of Defense in clinical IT innovation, and we're not going to discard all the things that we've done in the past. And in fact, that's how we're going to help DOD get better. So this is a system that's going to strengthen care for veterans and our active servicemembers.\nWe're going to be embarking upon something that's never been done before -- that is an integrated product, using the DOD platform, but it's going to require this integration with other vendors to create a system for veterans so that they can get care both in the community as well as in the Department of Defense. That's going to take the active cooperation of many companies and thought leaders, and it will serve as a model not only for the federal government, of federal agencies working together, but for all of healthcare that is trying to seek this type of interoperability.\nOnce again, I want to thank the President for his incredible commitment to helping our veterans and support the VA. And I also want to thank the Department of Defense, who have been incredibly helpful in this process, and the American Office of Innovation, who has been incredibly helpful in helping us think differently about how to solve problems.\nThis mission is too important for us not to get right. And I assure you we will. And I'd be glad to take any questions.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, two questions. One, how long will this take? You said it's the beginning of the process. And then, two, how will a veteran know and feel and experience a difference because of this decision?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Great. Great question. So this is the beginning of the process where we're going to start essentially entering into the details of how we would implement a contract. We expect that process -- again, trying to do this as quickly as possible -- will be about three to six months at the latest. And during that time, we're going to be developing both the implementation plans and the cost of this system so that we can go out and make sure that we're doing this right and that we have the resources available to do it.\nSecondly, to a veteran, they're now going to be able to have a single system from the time that they enlist in the military until potentially they die -- one single lifetime record. And so there will never be a need to be able to go back and forth and say, records aren't there for me, or my doctor isn't able to have input into what the Department of Defense is doing. And our community partners need that same type of interoperability.\nQ: How will that change things for people in the system now?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Well, as you know, my top clinical priority is to reduce veteran suicide. One of the areas that we've identified is a gap in the transition -- when you leave the military and all of a sudden you no longer have that structure that you were used to, and what happens to you before you get enrolled into either VA healthcare or community healthcare. That no longer is going to happen. We're going to have a seamless ability to make sure that information is there.\nSo to a veteran who's experiencing emotional disorders, when they reach out for help it's going to be easier to get them help. For other people who have physical problems, that same information is going to be there, so you can develop a coordinated care plan.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you're waiving competitive bidding for this. Do you have a ballpark estimate of how much it's going to cost? And is that factored into your current budget?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: We have not begun the cost negotiations. We know the Department of Defense had a $4.3 billion contract. VA is a bigger organization. But we have not begun those negotiations. Part of the reason why I have waived that process is because I absolutely believe -- and I've spent a lot of time reviewing the materials -- it is in the public interest to move quickly. And I also believe we can do this cheaper for the taxpayers by essentially moving forward quickly without a lengthy process.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. You were part of the last administration; in fact, you were Deputy VA Secretary. Is there a particular reason why this process, which you're announcing today, did not take place during the Obama administration? Did you drop the ball in the Obama administration? If you could, explain a little bit about that.\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: This is one of those problems that I talked about last week with all of you that I think spans administrations and has been going on for decades. I can count no fewer than seven blue ribbon commissions that have recommended that we move in a direction like this. The Commission on Care, which was a $68-million study, came out with this recommendation. And so I think people have felt that this was a direction that they should be moving in.\nI will tell you, it is hard to make decisions. There's a lot of built-in movement to keep things the way that they are. So while in the last administration we considered this and we looked at a number of things, I think that it really was this administration and the President's mandate to do business differently that allowed us to move forward with this type of speed.\nYes, sir.\nQ: You mentioned that (inaudible) for the contracting period. At what point in the future -- in the coming months or years, when veterans will be transitioned out, how will the records be seamlessly transferred to the VA? When does it kick in? And the second question would be, who at the White House was involved in this process? This is a priority of the OAI.\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: So, two questions. One is about the timing: When does a veteran actually begin to experience this? That is what we're going to be determining, the timeline during this three-to-six-month period when we roll it out. I do believe -- and everything that I'm doing is trying to act with speed -- that working with the Department of Defense and already using their planning materials and their change management tools, we will be able to do this much faster than if we had done it alone.\nSo the Department of Defense has taken a period of time before they've implemented their first system in the Fairchild Air Force Base, which has been successful. But I think we will be able to do ours even faster than they did.\nThanks again to Secretary Mattis and the Department of Defense, they have actually detailed over to us some of their key executives who have worked on their project; they now are at VA and they're helping us actually begin this. So we have institutional knowledge from them. That's considerable.\nYour second question had to do with who at the White House has been working with us. I will tell you that in this decision I not only reviewed large numbers of reports, independent management reports that we had consultants who had come into help us, but I've consulted with all the stakeholders that I could -- hospital CIOs, hospital CEOs, members of Congress, and people at the White House to be able to talk to all the stakeholders to make this decision at the White House. Of course, we've talked with the President's office, but also working closely with the American Office of Innovation. And all those are stakeholders that contributed to my thinking.\nYes, please.\nQ: During the Bush years, there was a problem with computers when it came to Medicaid and Medicare. During the Obama years, we know about ACA. What are the guarantees when you try to bring all -- integrate all the information from all the services into this one system? What are the guarantees?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: No guarantees. High-risk process, particularly when you're doing this in the largest integrated health system in the country. And so this is high risk. It's one of the reasons I made this decision. I think by going with the Department of Defense system, we are lowering our risk because we have a federal partner who's already gone through this process, and that's why we're taking their expertise and putting it into the VA. And again, with Secretary Mattis's commitment to work with us closely, I think we're lowering the risk.\nBut as a private sector CEO, I've done this several times successfully, but I've never done it on this scale, and so the risks are there. But we're going to make sure that we do this the right way.\nQ: A follow-up. What happens to those older veterans who have problems? And you're doing this now, trying to get it right now. But what happens to those who have been in the system for a long time? Where do they come in, and how long will this take to help them get into the system?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Well, this is a problem that many healthcare organizers that have transitioned to other electronic health records have found. You do not discard your old information. That would be clinically irresponsible. So you have to have a way of making sure that the old information is there, it transitions into a new system, or remains available for clinicians to have.\nSo that's a problem that I think that we're doing to be pretty good at handling.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Do you have the cost-benefit analysis, and can you share that with us?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yeah, some of our management consultants who have looked at this issue of off-the-shelf versus staying with maintenance have helped us look at the cost-benefit decision. That was part of my thinking. This is essentially the most cost-effective way to go to a commercial off-the-shelf system. The problem with what VA has been doing -- we have a $4.1 billion budget in IT; 70 percent is maintaining our current systems. And our systems are getting older. The Band-Aids are getting harder to hold the system together. Each year, I believe it will get more and more expensive to modernize our own system. We aren't able to keep the type of people that we want. So I think the best cost-benefit decision for taxpayers and for veterans is to move to an off-the-shelf system.\nQ: So a quick follow-up to that. You're talking about an off-the-shelf system. You're not developing new software. So the security will be there?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: What's that?\nQ: So the security -- the biggest problem with off-the-shelf is security.\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: One of the reasons, again, why I chose to go this route is because of cybersecurity. The Department of Defense has already invested in such high cybersecurity standards. Those are the standards that we need to be able to assure privacy and security for our veterans. And that's part of the reason why we're going this.\nJust to be clear, we are adopting an off-the-shelf system, but as I mentioned before, we are also embarking upon something that nobody has done before because of this problem of these commercial systems don't talk together. And we need them to talk together because many of our patients are out in the community, and our academic partners, many of them, use other systems besides Cerner. So we're creating something that is taking the best of what's off the shelf, but also creating something that doesn't exist today.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, I just wanted to clarify a couple things. The only thing that Congress needs to get involved with is the appropriations, yes or no?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yes.\nQ: You don't know what you're going to be asking for, so it's not built in the FY18 budget, right?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: You're correct.\nQ: But it will be higher than $4 billion, right?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: I would love to do it for less, but I think that would be unrealistic.\nQ: And you don't know -- you don't have a ballpark, right?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yes.\nQ: But is that going to hamper the appropriations if you want a three-to-six-month timeframe to be able to initiate what you're doing?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: We've already begun to engage, starting today, with the appropriations leadership in both the Senate and the House. And I will tell you that this is something that Congress has been asking for. I believe that they will support this. Of course, this has to be a dialogue between us. They have to make sure that we're making the decision at the benefit of the taxpayers as well as veterans and active servicemembers.\nBut I do believe we will have the leadership and the partnership to get us there.\nQ: And just to clarify one last thing. If this is an off-the-shelf system, this is not a low-bid process. That's why you're going this speed, right? You are not putting this out to bid. You have selected the vendor.\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: We have not agreed upon any pricing. But I can assure you that before we were to sign off on a contract, we are going to make sure that this is the best value for taxpayers.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you've gotten a couple questions around this, but what kind of fights do you anticipate in Congress when this -- by selecting this venue and not having a competitive bid, there will be some pushback, right?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Well, this wouldn't be Washington if there wasn't pushback. But I don't expect -- I do not expect any major fights on this. I think that the one thing that I feel extremely proud about, about the way the Congress has acted when it comes to veterans' issues, is the bipartisan support when it's the right thing to do for this country's veterans. And I do expect that to essentially carry through on this.\nThat does not mean that it is not appropriate to ask hard questions; to make sure that the due diligence is there; to make sure, as we said, this is a risky process -- that we've thought about everything and that we've considered people who have different options. But in the end, I do believe this is something that we will see strong bipartisan support for.\nQ: And another version of one of my colleague's questions: EHR has been promised before. Why is it going to happen? It was promised during the previous administration. Why is going to happen now? You say bipartisan support; we haven't seen a lot of evidence of that in Washington. So what makes you hopeful that it's this time?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Well, I've not seen the Department of Veterans Affairs come out with this type of decision before, so I think that this is new. We now know what is in the best interest of veterans, and we're moving ahead with an accelerated process so that we can get this done.\nAnd I do believe that this is exactly what Congress has asked us to do. I can count four times when they've asked DOD and VA to get in the same room, and I can count four times when VA and DOD left doing separate things. So this one is going to be different. The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs are together in lockstep on this, and the President is behind this. And we need Congress to support it, and I believe that support will be there.\nYes, all the way in the back.\nQ: Thank you. You mentioned how suicide prevention is one of your top priorities.\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Prevent -- suicide prevention, yes.\nQ: Yes. In that context, are you willing maybe to sit down with DOD and encourage the active duty officers to go on record about their mental problems and issues, while they are still in active duty, so you avoid, in a way, if it shows up after they leave the service?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: We are doing exactly that. We are in discussions with the Department of Defense. Secretary Mattis and I have talked about this. We know that what we're doing is not enough, and we have to look at exactly the issues that start in the Department of Defense and make sure that we're addressing them. The transition time and that gap between when you leave active service to when you enter as a civilian and you get healthcare, that's an area that we have to pay particular concern about. And that's why this EHR is going to be helpful. But we have to look all the way back into the process, just as you're suggesting. So we are doing that.\nYes, sir.\nQ: You mentioned seven blue ribbon commissions have recommended something along those lines. What's been the opposition -- the main reason it hasn't happened?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Well, I think one of the things that we're doing differently in this administration is that we're essentially eliminating some of the silos and turf battles. And, frankly, I think that if you put the veteran and the servicemember first, you would come to the conclusion that we've come to today.\nBut nobody likes to give up power and control over their system. In the Department of Veterans Affairs, we are very, very proud of our history of being the first major system to develop electronic medical records. This was done over 30 years ago by brave clinicians who went on their own and developed this. So giving this up, I do not want to underestimate how difficult that will be for people in the Department of Veterans Affairs. Change is not easy. But when you've had that for 30 years, it's going to be really hard. So this is a major decision for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nAnd as I've said previously, I wish the Department of Defense had joined us years and years ago so that we could be working together. But that isn't the situation I face as Secretary. They've moved forward. It's time that we move forward and come together.\nI'll take one more question.\nQ: Secretary, I'll just drill down on the question that Zeke asked, which was the Office of American Innovation that's here at the White House. You mentioned one of the stakeholders you consulted with. Can you speak about that role, specifically Jared Kushner who helps lead that office, and what kinds of interactions you've had with him in developing this?\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Yeah. When I became Secretary and the office was stood up, they indicated a strong interest in helping the Department of Veterans Affairs, which I welcomed. And when we sat down and they said, talk about the pain points -- what do you really need to do to make a quantum leap in where you are -- I identified the electronic record.\nAnd what we talked about is best practices, about how industries make quantum changes, how you go out and solicit information from leaders in the field to make sure that you get the right stakeholders and opinions. And so they were advisory in this process. This decision, though, was fully my decision to make, and there was no influence ever put on this. But they were very helpful in helping us keep and move the process along, and in facilitating discussions with the Department of Defense as well.\nThank you very much, everyone. Appreciate it.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\nAs the Vice President noted this morning, the American people elected a builder to be the 45th President of the United States, a builder who has a vision for modernizing the entire federal government. Secretary Shulkin just spoke about how that vision is being carried out at the VA, and this morning, the President launched a \"great new era in American Aviation,\" starting with the modernization of our outdated air traffic control system.\nToday, everything from the cars on the road to the cell phones in our pockets use GPS technology, but Washington has been unable to upgrade the air traffic control system from ground-based radio and radar systems, despite 14 years of attempts by the FAA.\nThis delay has left us stuck with a system that just can't keep up with an industry that has grown exponentially since it was designed. Our current air traffic control system costs our economy as much as $25 billion a year in delays, inefficiency, and unreliability. This is a problem that nearly everyone agrees needs to be solved.\nJoining the President today were representatives from the air traffic controllers union, passenger advocates, leaders of airline and cargo companies, and every former COO of the FAA. And those aren't groups that typically agree on much of anything.\nBut even with all of these stakeholders behind air traffic control reform, it was still stuck in the Washington political machine. President Trump was elected to unstick these kind of common-sense efforts, and we'll be continuing to work with Congress on getting these principles turned into legislation and getting that legislation to the President's desk.\nTo accompany the President's announcement, the Department of Transportation today launched a new microsite -- that's SmarterSkies.gov, which will continually be updated with factsheets, Q&A, and other information regarding ATC reform.\nInfrastructure is only one of the many action items on the President's legislative agenda. The healthcare team is engaging with Congress daily on the American Health Care Act, which we hope to see the Senate take up soon. New stories of skyrocketing premiums and fleeing providers are coming almost every day.\nJust last Friday, Blue Cross Blue Shield in Nebraska announced that they are cancelling their Obamacare-compliant bronze and catastrophic plans, which are the only remaining plans they currently sell on the exchange. That leaves the entire state with only one choice for insurance on the exchanges, and that insurer raised rates by 51 percent last year and is threatening to pull out of Iowa completely.\nWith our healthcare system breaking down around us, this administration is committed to finding a solution. This afternoon, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of HHS Services Dr. Tom Price, Administrator of the Small Business Administration Linda McMahon, and Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Seema Verma are holding a listening session with female small business owners to talk about how we will repeal and replace Obamacare with a plan that benefits all Americans.\nTomorrow, the President will welcome representatives and senators to the White House to talk more about what's next on the legislative agenda, including repealing and replacing Obamacare and crafting a revolutionary tax reform proposal that will provide relief to hardworking taxpayers.\nAnd on Wednesday, Infrastructure Week continues with the President's visit to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he will speak about his wide-ranging vision for rebuilding our country, with a special focus on repairing our 12,000-mile inland waterway system, which carries $230 billion in commerce annually while our locks and dams crumble because the federal government can't fund the critical repairs they need. The President will present his sustainable solution to this problem in Ohio on Wednesday.\nAnd because I know all of you are very deeply concerned about the births of each of my children, I wanted to carry on with tradition and announce that my son, George, will be two on Thursday. So, happy early birthday to George. And with that, I'll take your question.\nJohn Roberts.\nQ: Sarah, as you know, also on Wednesday, as the President heads to Ohio, James Comey is scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee. And there's question as to whether or not the White House will allow him to testify -- pardon me?\nQ: Thursday.\nQ: Thursday. I'm still jetlagged.\nMS. SANDERS: If only they had that same flight before correcting us.\nQ: He's scheduled to testify on Thursday. And there's a question as to whether or not you will invoke executive privilege, or if you will allow him to testify. And I have a second question.\nMS. SANDERS: The President's power to exert executive privilege is very well established. However, in order to facilitate a swift and thorough examination of the facts sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee, President Trump will not exert executive privilege regarding James Comey's scheduled testimony.\nQ: I have a follow-up on that question. On the President's tweets regarding the travel ban, Kellyanne Conway's husband pointed out that such tweets are not helpful when it comes to the Solicitor General's ability to make an effective argument before the Supreme Court. Is the President concerned that he may be tainting the waters of the legal system by issuing such tweets?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at all. The President is very focused on exactly what that order spells out, and that's protecting Americans, protecting national security. And he has every constitutional authority to do that through that executive order, and he maintains that and that position hasn't changed in the slightest.\nJon.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Why was the President picking a fight with the mayor of London right after his city was hit by a terrorist attack?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't see that the President is picking a fight with the mayor of London at all. I think that, again, the President's point is something he said, frankly, back -- gosh, it's been almost two years now, a year and a half ago -- when the President talked about how we have to be more committed to national security. One of the reasons we have the travel ban here through that executive order is a focus on national security. That was the point he was trying to make.\nQ: But the President is saying that the mayor said there is no reason to be alarmed by the terrorist attack. That is not what the mayor said. The mayor, in fact, said that the threat level remains severe, that the chances of another attack are highly likely. He was saying don't be alarmed by the armed police presence on the street. And the President directly misrepresented what the mayor of London said.\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think that's actually true. I think that the media wants to spin it that way, but I think that the President --\nQ: You think the mayor was saying there's no reason to be alarmed by an attack on his city? Do you think that's what he was saying?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think that the point is, is there is a reason to be alarmed. We have constant attacks going on not just there but across the globe, and we have to start putting national security and global security at an all-time high. President Trump has been very clear that's his priority and he's not backing away from that.\nSteve.\nQ: Sarah, what was the President's reaction to the move by several Middle Eastern allies to sever ties with Qatar?\nMS. SANDERS: The President is committed to continuing to have conversations with all of the people involved in that process, with all of those countries. We want to continue to deescalate that. And at this point, we're continuing to work with each of those partners.\nQ: Secondly, did the President get any word that this was going to happen when he was in Saudi Arabia a couple of weeks ago?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of that. But the State Department would probably be best suited to answer that question.\nJim.\nQ: You just mentioned the word \"ban.\" The President, when he was tweeting earlier today, said, \"People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\" But early on in the administration, when you were trying to justify, when this White House was trying to justify the executive order on extreme vetting and these travel restrictions, the White House was adamant that these were travel restrictions, that it was not a travel ban. Sean Spicer, from that podium, said it was not a travel ban. Is it a travel ban?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think the President cares what you call it, whether you call it a ban, whether you call it a restriction --\nQ: Sounds like (inaudible) what you call it.\nMS. SANDERS: He cares that we call it national security and that we take steps to protect the people of this country. It's real simple. Everybody wants to get into the labels and the semantics of it, but the bottom line is he's trying to protect the citizens of this country. The danger is extremely clear. The law is very clear. And the need for this executive order is very clear. And the President's priority in protecting the people is very clear. Full stop.\nQ: And let me ask you to follow up on what Jon was asking about with respect to the mayor of London. There are going to be folks who are going to ask the question: Was the President attacking the mayor of London because he's Muslim?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at all. And I think to suggest something like that is utterly ridiculous.\nMatthew.\nQ: Given the importance of Twitter --\nMS. SANDERS: I said Matthew.\nQ: Sorry.\nMS. SANDERS: That's okay. I'll come back around.\nQ: Thank you. Given the importance of Twitter in the President's communication strategy, can you tell us if his tweets are now being vetted by a lawyer or any other aide? And if not, why not? Or if so, when did that start?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of. But I think social media for the President is extremely important. It gives him the ability to speak directly to the people without the bias of the media filtering those types of communications. He at this point has over 100-plus million contacts through social media and all those platforms. I think it's a very important tool for him to be able to utilize.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. So I have a question about those executive order comments the President made this morning. He said that he wishes that his Justice Department had stuck with the original executive order. DOJ, of course, is part of the executive branch. If he wanted to stick with the original EO, then why didn't he order the Department of Justice to stick with that? Why did he even sign the revised one if he wanted to stick with the original?\nMS. SANDERS: And the purpose -- they were trying to meet the demands of the Ninth Circuit. But, again, the President has been very clear, he wants to go as far and as strong as possible under the Constitution to protect the people in this country. That's what he felt the first executive order did. The second one was another version of that.\nBut, look, let's be really clear about what this is. These are six countries that were identified not just by this administration, but by the Obama administration and by Congress that are dangerous, they're unstable, they're volatile. And frankly, they're not capable, or unwilling to even vet people coming in or out. That's what this is about. Everybody wants to make it something different than a national security issue, and that's exactly what it is. And that's why the President is so focused on pushing it forward in the strongest form possible.\nQ: If it is that important as national security, and he believed the first one was safer and constitutional, then why did he sign the second one, if now he's coming out today saying, oh, we never should have done the second one?\nMS. SANDERS: He was looking to, again, match the demands laid out by the Ninth Circuit and, for the purpose of expediency, to start looking at the best way possible to move that process forward.\nQ: Sarah, I just want to clarify that. So as it is currently written, given that he called it, as Matthew is pointing out, \"politically correct\" or (inaudible), does the President support his own travel ban as it is currently written?\nMS. SANDERS: Absolutely. Again, he supports steps moving in the direction at all levels and forms possible. He wants the strongest executive order out there, and he wanted to move as quickly as possible, and that was the reason for that purpose.\nQ: Two questions. The original intent of the travel ban was to provide a temporary pause in order to review immigration policies and procedures of those coming into the United States. That was January 21st, 22nd. It has been nearly five months since then. What progress has the administration made looking and vetting and doing some of that while this travel ban is working its way through the court system?\nMS. SANDERS: Extreme vetting is taking place. And that's something that's extremely important that was laid out in the memo. I think one other thing to --\nQ: Specifically --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: So specifically, though, what has administration been working on when it comes to extreme vetting?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think that, if you want to get down into the details, I would refer you to the Department of Justice on some of those points. But one of the things I can tell you is that there are over 300 people that are under investigation that are part of this process -- under investigation for terrorist-related activity in our system. And that's a large part of the vetting process that the President has stepped up.\nQ: And then my last one for you. You just mentioned that the President's tweets are --\nMS. SANDERS: Four-question Monday.\nQ: -- a filter -- essentially a way to get around the filter of the bias media when it comes to his tweets, that he sees them as an important way to get his message out. Just this morning, another top advisor in this White House said that the media was obsessed with the President's tweets, implying they didn't matter. So I guess, just philosophically, which is it? Do the President's tweets matter or are they just something that the media gets obsessed about?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that they matter in the sense that it gives him a communications tool, again, that isn't filtered through media bias. But at the same time, I do think that the media obsesses over every period, dot. As John was a perfect example earlier, he made a mistake. His colleague politely corrected him. If somebody from our administration had done the same, all hell would have broken loose, and it would be that -- you know, it's just total, like, chaos and conundrum here at the White House.\nSo I think it's just the obsession over every detail of the President's tweets.\nQ: But you're not disputing these are presidential statements.\nMS. SANDERS: They come directly from President's Twitter account? No.\nQ: So to follow up on the whole travel ban thing, the President also said this morning he'd like the Department of Justice to ask the Supreme Court for an expedited hearing. Has he done that? Has he asked DOJ for an expedited hearing?\nMS. SANDERS: He has.\nQ: So he instructed them to instruct --\nMS. SANDERS: He has asked for an expedited process, I can say that.\nQ: And then secondly, can you say, on the ambassador -- the U.S. ambassador to the UK, can you say why we don't have one yet? Is there a reason for the delay -- something in particular?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of that, and I'll have to check and get back to you on that.\nMajor.\nQ: Sarah, following up on that last question -- in addition to seeking the expedited process, the President said, so we can seek a much tougher version. Is a third version of the travel ban in the works?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of. But I know that, again --\nQ: What should we take from that presidential statement?\nMS. SANDERS: That the President is going to continue taking aggressive steps every single day to protect the people in this country.\nQ: Is it fair to interpret that he's asked DOJ to contemplate a tougher version?\nMS. SANDERS: I think he's asked the entire administration to look for ways we can defeat ISIS and to protect the American people. And if that's part of that process, it could be. But I don't know specifically if that's part of it.\nQ: And, Sarah, from your vantage point then, based on the questions that Jonathan and Jim asked, what is the origin of this confusion or misunderstanding about what the President said about the mayor of London? Is it the mayor of London's fault?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, I'm not following what you're asking.\nQ: Well, the mayor of London and many there feel that the President not only took the comments that the mayor of London made out of context, but compounded an emotionally difficult experience for Londoners. Who's to blame for that? Are they misinterpreting the President? Or did the President make a mistake?\nMS. SANDERS: The President has been extremely clear that we stand in complete solidarity with the United Kingdom and protecting that relationship and that partnership. And we're fully committed to doing everything we can to help them in this process, and we condemn any act even similar to that.\nApril.\nQ: How is this President not contradicting this administration when he tweets out \"TRAVEL BAN\" in caps? And when you're talking about extreme vetting, how does he not contradict himself when he's trying to get this thing to go through the Supreme Court?\nMS. SANDERS: Well, look, again, I don't know how many times I have to answer this question today, but I'll try to do it one more time. I think that the President isn't concerned with what you call it; he's concerned with national security and protecting people in this country. Whether you call it a travel ban --\nQ: -- he goes from one extreme to the next, and then goes back to the first in the Supreme Court --\nMS. SANDERS: He's not concerned with being politically correct, he's concerned with protecting the American people. I mean, that's the bottom line here. And he's going to take whatever step he can to move that agenda forward.\nQ: But does he believe this could be a loss from him going for him and this administration with this extreme vetting or travel ban, going from travel ban to extreme vetting, back to \"TRAVEL BAN\" on Twitter in extreme caps?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think he thinks any step he takes towards moving the ball forward in protecting the American people and implementing the executive order is ever going to be a mistake.\nQ: And MY last question, where is Sean?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: Where is Sean?\nMS. SANDERS: He's here today.\nQ: Why didn't he come out?\nMS. SANDERS: This is part of my job as well. Did you guys ever ask any of the other deputy press secretaries when they came out --\nQ: Yes, we asked them all.\nQ: We asked all of them.\nQ: Is he in a new position now or are you just --\nMS. SANDERS: I mean, he is taking on a little bit of extra duty at this point. So I think it's --\nQ: Has his position changed then?\nMS. SANDERS: It's probably upgraded at this point, given that we don't have a communications director.\nQ: So you will be the new press secretary here?\nMS. SANDERS: I did not say that at all. I'm just filling in for the day, April. There are a lot of demands on his schedule, particularly given the fact that there's not a communications director, and this is part of my job as well. And when I'm needed, I'll step in.\nQ: One of the major stories this morning in Washington suggested that, in fact, in Brussels, the President was given a draft of his speech to the NATO partners that suggested that he would invoke or at least respect the Article 5 commitments. A senior administration official told us flatly that the President himself did not take the Article 5 reference out of the speech. So, Sarah, who did?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of that, and I'd have to check back and let you know. Thanks, guys.\nEND 2:24 P.M.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=125945", "text": "Well, good afternoon. And on behalf of President Trump and the First Family, welcome to the White House. I am honored to be able to welcome you here for an ongoing discussion from some of the great women entrepreneurs across this country about the President's determination and the need to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nWe appreciate you coming to bring your real-world experience. I look very much forward to hearing your perspective and hearing how best we can carry this message to the Congress and to the country.\nI'm grateful to be joined by the Secretary of HHS, Dr. Tom Price; the Administrator of the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, Seema Verma; and also the Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway. We'll also be joined by other members of the Cabinet as our conversation goes forward.\nIt is a great privilege for me on behalf of the President to welcome so many women small-business owners from across the country. They talk about the terrible burden that Obamacare is placing on job creators.\nAnd first, let me just thank you for what you do. Thank you for the jobs that you create. I had a little small business of my own that my wife and I started in the basement of our home about 25 years ago. And I know what it is to be in business for yourself. I know the sacrifices that you make, the hardships that often you face. But first and foremost, thank you for being great corporate citizens. And thank you for the success that you have created that has benefitted families who have the opportunity to work with you and work for you.\nIt is estimated that more than 11.3 million businesses in America are women-owned business, employing nearly 9 million people across this country, and having more than $1.6 trillion in revenues.\nWomen-owned businesses are growing like gangbusters across this country -- it really is amazing -- at a rate five times faster than the national average over the past 10 years.\nPresident Trump and I are grateful for what you do every day, and we want you to be more successful than ever before. That's why the President has been fighting to roll back excessive regulations, to unleash the power of American energy, keep the cost of energy low, and why we've been fighting since the first day of this administration to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nObamacare is putting a tremendous business [burden], as you all know, on small businesses across this country with its reams of red tape, skyrocketing premium costs, mandates, and taxes that have been costing jobs and costing growth in this economy. I've got a couple of great business owners around this table, but I want to hear from just a few of them. Kelly Moore and Amy Pope-Wells, I'm going to ask to speak about your personal experiences.\nBut in Kelly's case, under Obamacare her eastern Ohio business, GKM Auto Parts, has faced I'm told double-digit premium hikes every year. As you often say your worst day as a small-business owner was last year when you had to tell your employees that you could no longer provide health insurance.\nI'm going to give you a chance with members of the media present to be able to reflect on that.\nAmy Pope-Wells is the owner of Link Staffing Services in Jacksonville, Florida. We've had the opportunity to meet in the past and know what a dynamic business leader you are, but the hardship that you've faced -- not only in your own business, but in the businesses that you serve that are facing the impact of the cost of healthcare following Obamacare. It's a story that needs to be told.\nThe truth is the American people are struggling under the weight of the failed policies of Obamacare, and it must go. Secretary Price and his team at Health and Human Services released a study just two weeks ago showing that in real numbers premiums have more than doubled under Obamacare since 2013, up 105 percent.\nNow, I was in the Congress when Obamacare was passed into law, and I remember all the promises -- if you like your doctor, you can keep them. Remember? If you like your insurance, you could keep it. But the central promise was the cost of health insurance would go down, and here we are that since 2013 alone premiums across this country have increased by 105 percent. America can't afford Obamacare any longer.\nPresident Trump and our administration are working every day with members of Congress, and we're not going to rest until we repeal and replace Obamacare with the kind of healthcare reform the American people deserve, healthcare reform built on consumer choice, on free-market principles, on state-based innovation, and a respect for the doctor-patient relationship.\nWith that, I'm here to listen, not to talk. And let me thank you again on behalf of the President for your willingness to come here to the White House to tell you story.\nI also see Linda McMahon, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, is with us today. We're grateful for your leadership.\nBut first, Kelly, and then Amy, maybe you could share a little bit of your experience with Obamacare and just how important it will be to repeal and replace it.\nMS. MOORE: I don't believe my story is unique. I think my story actually is one that's told by a number of small-business owners. But in 2016, we were facing a 22 percent increase in premiums, and this is after a steady rise of double digits ever since the ACA was passed. With the exception of one year, we had double-digit increases.\nI have good employees. I think of them as family. It was gut-wrenching to tell them that I was ending their benefit of insurance. And they are decent people who work hard for us, and we appreciate their good talents. And we look to the future and think, how will we be able to attract good talented people in the future? It's been very difficult since then for them to find affordable healthcare. And I think that the problem has been exacerbated, not gone away with all of this uncertainty about the future.\nSo for us it's critical that we have some sort of stability in our business, that we get some sort of an answer as to what we can expect in the future.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Kelly. Thanks.\nMS. MOORE: Thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thanks for your obvious deep concern for your employees. Because you'd like to be able to afford to cover them.\nMS. MOORE: I would love to be able to offer that benefit again.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. But it just reached a point with double-digit increases you could no longer afford to make that part of your benefits?\nMS. MOORE: It was a decision of whether to have one of my employees have to -- have to lay off somebody in order to afford it for the rest. And that didn't make good business sense, and it was unaffordable for them. We did try by splitting the premium maybe 20 at the beginning; 70-30, 60-40. We also dropped spousal coverage. We've made efforts to make it affordable, but they no longer have the premiums or the deductibles that they could afford with the amount that they were paying.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Kelly, you know I see from the nods around the table that sounds like a pretty familiar experience to all the women entrepreneurs around the table today.\nAnd I appreciate you sharing --\nMS. MOORE: Thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: -- your perspective with us today.\nAmy Pope-Wells, can you maybe speak a little bit about your struggle both in Link Staffing Services with Obamacare, but also with all the companies that you work with in meeting their employment needs, what you're seeing across the marketplace?\nMS. POPE-WELLS: Well, I think -- like you said, it's not unique. I think all of us saw somewhere around a 25 percent increase. So as a small business, you have to make budgetary decisions. But part of that is not just the decision of the budget, but then how it impacts all those employees. We have about 85 or so contractors in the field and a staff of six that support them. That's just the beginning of it.\nYou got an increase. You either pass the increase or you don't. We had clients, which I never even envisioned being a problem, who refused to start doing business with us because under the regulation we were required to list ACA charges on our invoices. And those clients said, we did not vote for it. We did not want it. We do not appreciate it.\nSo we as a business not only took a 25 percent premium increase, we also saw that clients were refusing to participate, which we had to make tough business decisions again. So we made those decisions of what plans to go with the 25 percent increase, what clients we would lose or keep.\nBut then the quagmire of the rules and regulations start. We found ourselves having to spend -- everybody in our office spending time on benefits management: medical procedures being denied, people not understanding the rules or the processes. We got into the insurance business. We physically had to learn how to educate and support our team, and we're not in the insurance business.\nSo it's been a challenge that I believe us, as Americans, should start simplifying and figure out how to fix it better. Because we want a healthy population.\nWe even saw our younger population who just refused to start taking it. They said, I'm not going to pay $1,200 or $1,900 a month for a premium -- and walk away. So we've got our young populations deciding not to take healthcare. That's not the solution.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Right, so how many people around the table think that there is an urgent need to repeal and replace Obamacare?\nMS. POPE-WELLS: Oh, absolutely.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you for that perspective.\nMS. POPE-WELLS: You're welcome.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And thank you all very much. I appreciate it.", "timestamp": "2017-06-05", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at a Listening Session on Healthcare with Women Entrepreneurs"}
{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126287", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, all. Thank you, Ambassador Gray, for that kind introduction.\nIt truly is an honor to be with you tonight as the Atlantic Council celebrates so many distinguished leaders from North America and Europe, and from across the wider world. The Atlantic Council Distinguished Leadership Awards 2017 -- thank you all for making this possible and for your warm welcome. (Applause.)\nAnd I bring greetings tonight from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nNow before I get started let me first and foremost, on the President's behalf speak a word from the heart. Let me express the sorrow of our administration and all the American people for the horrific terrorist attack just two days against our cherished friend and beloved ally, the United Kingdom.\nOur hearts break for the families of the victims and the injured in London. They are just the latest innocents to suffer at the hands of terrorists, joining those who died in Manchester, in Paris, in Istanbul, in Brussels, Berlin, San Bernardino, and too many other places -- victims of barbaric acts of terrorism. They have our prayers, but more than that --our unwavering resolve.\nSpeaking just last night, President Trump said \"this bloodshed must end\" and \"this bloodshed will end.\" (Applause.)\nAnd I want to speak not only for all the Americans gathered here but all of our friends from around the world, President Donald Trump will not relent until we protect the American people and our allies from the scourge of global terrorism.\nBut as you well know, this is a threat we must face together. Now is the time for NATO and this Transatlantic Alliance to stand united and stand strong in the face of global terrorism.\nOur enemies seek to divide us so that they might defeat us. But our Alliance has faced far greater threats and emerged stronger and more secure and united as allies. I say with confidence and with faith we will drive the cancer of terrorism from the face of the Earth, and we will do so together. (Applause.)\nSo let me thank all of you in the Atlantic Council for hosting this important gathering. To President Fred Kempee, Chairman Jon Huntsman, all the Council's leadership -- thank you for your important work. For 56 years the Atlantic Council has drawn our continents closer together, and our President and the American people are grateful for more than half a century of work.\nLet me also recognize the members of the Brzezinski family who are here with us tonight. Our thoughts and our prayers are with you. Mr. Brzezinski was a great man. And more important, he was a good man. And America will bear the imprint Zbigniew Brzezinki's leadership for generations to come. (Applause.)\nAnd let me join in the chorus of congratulations to all the recipients of this year's award, many who I've had the privilege to know before and greatly admire like Admiral Michelle Howard, Her Royal Highness Haya Bint Al Hussein, Bill Ford, Jr., Renйe Fleming.\nAnd especially let me express my appreciation and congratulations to the winner of the Distinguished International Leadership Award who in the time that I met him in Brussels and the time he spent with the President at the White House and just recently overseas has demonstrated his role and his commitment to be an unfailing advocate for a stronger and more secure Transatlantic Alliance, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. You have our congratulations and our thanks. (Applause.)\nIt is an honor also to be joined here this evening by the leader of the newest member of our Atlantic Alliance, Prime Minister Markovic of Montenegro. Congratulations to you and to the people of Montenegro on your accession to NATO. (Applause.)\nI had the privilege of welcoming the Prime Minister to the White House today. We had a wonderful discussion. I was very humbled to be able to share a few moments with him on the very day that Montenegro became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nSo to Mr. Secretary General, Mr. Prime Minister, let me just say to each of those leaders that were represented in Brussels recently, President Trump so appreciated, as I do, the opportunity to meet with all of you and with NATO leaders in Brussels just a few weeks ago and over the last several months. It truly has marked this administration's beginning of a relationship that I know will only strengthen the Alliance across the Atlantic in the months and years ahead. (Applause.)\nNow the world saw firsthand just a few weeks ago, President Trump embracing his role and America's role as leader of the free world. I know that under the President's leadership, the United States' leadership that I know our Alliance will grow stronger, our people will be safer, and freedom will march onward.\nYou know, it's fitting that I'm here on June the 5th. This is actually a seminal day in the history of our transatlantic relationship.\nSeventy years ago today, it's amazing to think that George Marshall outlined his groundbreaking plan for the United States of America to partner with Europe to rebuild its economies after the ravages of World War Two, and to keep lit the flame of freedom on the continent where freedom was first kindled.\nThe Marshall Plan established the foundation of security and prosperity that reigns in Europe to this very day.\nTwo years later, it was on that foundation that we created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to provide for the collective defense and to protect all that we've built together.\nAnd today, under President Donald Trump, let me assure you, the United States vows will continue to build -- to reach new heights of prosperity and security -- and we will continue to strengthen the bonds between our nation and the nations of Europe for the benefit of our peoples for generations to come. (Applause.)\nAs the world looked on, in his meeting with Secretary General Stoltenberg in April, President Trump reaffirmed the United States' commitment to the NATO Alliance and to the enduring values that we proudly share.\nAnd make no mistake: Our commitment is unwavering. We will meet our obligations to our people to provide for the collective defense of all our allies.\nThe United States is resolved, as we were at NATO's founding and in every hour since, to live by that principle that an attack on one of us is an attack on us all. (Applause.)\nOur unbreakable unity for freedom is our greatest strength. And a strong NATO is vitally important, especially in these trying times.\nOnly a few days ago, speaking at the unveiling of NATO's beautiful Article 5 Memorial, President Trump evoked in his words the \"courage of our people, the strength of our resolve, and the commitments that bind us together as one.\" And this President called on us to rise together to confront in his words the \"grave security concerns\" that face our historic Alliance.\nFrom Russia's efforts to redraw international borders by force, to Iran's attempts to destabilize the Middle East, to the global menace of terrorism that can strike anywhere, at any time -- it seems that the world is more dangerous today than at any point since the fall of Communism a quarter century ago.\nWith the rise of adversaries new and old, our Alliance must continue to evolve to confront the threats of today and tomorrow, especially with where I began tonight, confronting the threat and the menace of terrorism.\nTo be clear: It should be \"cause for alarm\" to us all, that we need to deploy our military to protect our citizens going to a concert, watching a marathon, or simply taking a stroll on a Saturday night because that is not the way a free people should ever be forced to live. (Applause.)\nAlready our Alliance is taking vital steps to protect our citizens and hunt down the terrorists on our terms, on their soil.\nNATO continues to play a leading role in equipping the government and people of Afghanistan to confront the threat of terror. Last week's horrible mass-murder attack in Kabul only underscores the importance of our mission.\nAnd in light of the President's statement in Brussels that \"the NATO of the future must include a great focus on terrorism,\" I know it's heartening to the President and to our administration to see that NATO will become a full member of the Global Campaign to Counter ISIS and play a greater role in our shared fight against terrorism.\nBut to most effectively confront the terrorist threat -- and any other challenge, known or unknown, that faces our Alliance -- we must all be prepared do our part, without exception.\nIt's encouraging that our NATO allies committed in Brussels to develop national plans to fulfill their Wales commitment to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense.\nWe're grateful to those nations that have already taken concrete steps to increase their commitment to our common security. But we have a long way to go. And as the President said in Brussels, 2 percent should be considered \"the bare minimum\" in this time of widening challenges and unknowable threats.\nAnd be confident of this, President Donald Trump will continue to work with Secretary General Stoltenberg and all our NATO allies to ensure that our Alliance has the resources and the capabilities it needs to accomplish its noble mission well into the 21st century. (Applause.)\nAnd as we look toward the future, we cannot only look inward. NATO's \"Open Door\" must always remain so, for those nations, like our newest ally Montenegro, that share our values, wish to contribute to the most successful alliance in history, and seek a brighter future of security and prosperity for our nations and the world, the door must remain open.\nThe truth is that NATO is as important today as it was at its founding nearly 70 years ago. We are bound together by the same timeless ideals -- freedom, democracy, justice, and the rule of law.\nWe share a past -- of shared sacrifice, and shared commitment -- and after all we've been through, I know we share a future, too.\nToday, tomorrow, and every day hence be confident that the United States is now and will always be Europe's greatest ally.\nOur devotion to this historic Alliance is unwavering and eternal. And together, we will go forth to meet that glorious future that awaits freedom-loving people.\nOne of my favorite quotes of Winston Churchill is actually carved into the wall of the narthex of the National Cathedral. It simply reads as follows. It's words that he spoke before the Congress in a time of great challenge in the life of this nation. Prime Minister Churchill said, \"He must indeed have a blind soul, who cannot see that some great purpose and design is being worked out here below, of which we have the honor to be the faithful servants.\"\nTo all of us in this historic Transatlantic Alliance, to all the freedom-loving nations represented here, let us have that same faith, let us be the faithful servants of freedom, and let us rededicate ourselves to the preservation of this Alliance and all it stands for.\nThank you for the honor of being with you tonight. Thank you for the work of the Atlantic Council. God bless NATO, all of our allies, and God bless the United States of America.

This is the most recent roundtable in a series of listening sessions hosted at the White House as the Administration continues to work with Congress on a path forward to repealing and replacing Obamacare, and reforming the broken healthcare system.\nThe Vice President started the conversation by welcoming the small business owners to the White House, noting the importance of having women entrepreneurs from across the country express their concerns about the collapsing Obamacare law.\nSecretary Price expressed the need for Congress to act, and the initiatives HHS is executing to mitigate the damages of the burdensome rules and regulations that have negatively affected America's small businesses. Administrator McMahon discussed the feedback she has received from many small business owners who have expressed that the biggest hurdle to small business growth is the rising costs of healthcare. Administrator Verma highlighted her own story as a small business owner, and the number one challenge she faced was dealing with burdensome government regulations. Kellyanne Conway also discussed her background as a small business owner, and the need to repeal and replace Obamacare to lessen the burden on taxpayers.\nAll of the entrepreneurs noted that their stories were not unique, and many shared the same difficulties of offering healthcare benefits to their employees, especially affordable ones with low premiums and low deductibles. The adverse effects of Obamacare on their businesses, including being forced to cut benefits for their employees due to the rising costs of healthcare, was a common theme preventing their businesses from flourishing.\n\"We had to make a conscious decision not to grow because of Obamacare,\" Sandra Dozier Hill, Founder of Hill & Associate CPAs told the group. Her firm is down to four workers because it was too costly for them to replace an employee that retired.\n\"Healthcare is the anchor that keeps dragging us down,\" added NeeCee Lee, Payroll Manager and Co-Owner of Lee and Cates Glass and Flat Glass Distributors.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 12:02 p.m. in the East Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Vice President Michael R. Pence; and Secretary of Veterans Affairs David J. Shulkin.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=125926", "text": "Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike. I really appreciate everything, and I appreciate you being here. But I especially want to thank Secretary Elaine Chao, Leader Kevin McCarthy—thank you, Kevin—Chairman Bill Shuster—thank you very much, Bill—and all the Members of Congress—we have many of them here today—for joining us as we prepare to enter a great new era in American aviation. [Applause] It's about time too, I can tell you.\nVeterans' Health Care\nBut before discussing our plans to modernize air travel, I want to provide an update on our efforts to fix and modernize vital services for our veterans, our great, great veterans who we all love. For decades the Federal Government has struggled to accomplish something that should be very, very simple: seamlessly transferring a veteran's medical records from the Defense Department to the veterans groups and to the VA. In recent years, it has taken not just days or weeks, but many months for the records to follow the veteran. This has caused massive problems for our veterans.\nI'm very proud to say that we are finally taking steps to solve this situation once and for all. Secretary Shulkin announced this morning that the VA will announce and modernize its medical records to use the same system as the Department of Defense. No more complications. The records will now be able to follow the veteran when they leave service, meaning faster, better, and far better quality care. Okay? [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nThis is one of the biggest wins for our veterans in decades. And I congratulate Secretary Shulkin for making this very, very important decision. Thank you, Secretary. Appreciate it. I appreciate it. He's done a great job. Stand up, Secretary. Where is Secretary Shulkin? What a great job. Thank you.\nOf course, there is still much work to do, but for today's action, it shows the determined leadership and what it can accomplish: great, great reform. So, again, to David Shulkin, thank you. To all of our veterans who have a served this Nation, a very, very special thank you. This is truly wonderful, really monumental reform, so important for our veterans. But it's just the beginning.\nAir Traffic Control Reform\nWe're here today to discuss another issue that has gone unsolved for far too long. For too many years, our country has tolerated unacceptable delays at the airport, long wait times on the tarmac, and a slowing of commerce and travel that costs us billions and billions of dollars in lost hours and lost dollars themselves. Today we're proposing to take American air travel into the future—finally. Finally, right? [Applause] Finally. It's been a long time.\nWe're proposing reduced wait times, increased route efficiency, and far fewer delays. Our plan will get you where you need to go more quickly, more reliably, more affordably. and yes—for the first time in a long time—on time. We will launch this air travel revolution by modernizing the outdated system of air traffic control. It's about time. Since the early days of commercial air service, the Federal Government has owned and operated the United States air traffic control system. Yet, more than a half a century later, the government is still using much of the exact same outdated technology. At a time when every passenger has GPS technology in their pockets, our air traffic control system still runs on radar and ground-based radio systems that they don't even make anymore, they can't even fix anymore, and many controllers must use slips of paper to track our thousands and thousands of planes that are up in the air.\nOur air traffic control system was designed when roughly 100,000 people flew at our airports each year. We are now approaching nearly 1 billion passengers annually. The current system cannot keep up, hasn't been able to keep up for many years. It causes flight delays and crippling inefficiencies, costing our economy as much as $25 billion a year in economic output. We live in a modern age, yet our air traffic control system is stuck painfully in the past.\nThe FAA has been trying to upgrade our Nation's air traffic control system for a long period of years. But after billions and billions of tax dollars spent and the many years of delays, we are still stuck with an ancient, broken, antiquated, horrible system that doesn't work. Other than that, it's quite good. [Laughter]\nThe previous administration spent over $7 billion trying to upgrade the system and totally failed. Honestly, they didn't know what the hell they were doing. A total waste of money, $7 billion-plus-plus.\nIt's time to join the future. That is why I'm proposing new principles to Congress for air traffic control reform making flights quicker, safer, and more reliable. Crucially, these reforms are supported by air traffic controllers themselves. They're the ones that know the systems that they want. They know it better than anybody. And we have people that don't even call them in the past. But now we call them.\nI'm also proud to be joined today by passenger advocates, pilot unions, and leaders of airlines and cargo companies who strongly support our new framework and our bidding process. And we're bidding, ideally, to one great company—there will be many bids, but one great company that can piece it all together—not many companies all over the United States, like in the past. When they came time to piece it together, it didn't work. There were all different systems. We threw away billions and billions of dollars.\nI am very grateful that every former FAA chief and chief operating officers and three former Transportation Secretaries—Jim Burnley, Elizabeth Dole, and Mary Peters—stand with us today. Thank you. This is an incredible coalition for change. All over the room, it's a coalition for change. The leaders of the industry.\nAt its core, our new plan will dramatically improve America's air traffic control system by turning it over to a self-financing, nonprofit organization. This new entity will not need taxpayer money, which is very shocking when people hear that. They don't hear that too often.\nUnder this new plan, the Federal Aviation Administration will focus firmly on what it does best: safety. A separate nonprofit entity would be charged with ensuring route efficiency, timely service, and a long-awaited reduction in delays.\nOur plan will also maintain support for rural communities and small airports, including airfields used by our Air National Guard units—great people. And very importantly, air traffic controllers will highly—and this will be highly valued. These are highly valued people. These are amazing people that know this system so well. And under our plan, they will have more financial security, professional opportunity, and far superior equipment, the best equipment anywhere in the world. There will never be anything like what we're doing. And other systems are very good. I won't tell you the names of the country, but we have studied numerous countries, one in particular; they have a very, very good system. Ours is going to top it by a lot.\nOur incredible air traffic controllers keep us safe every day even though they are forced to use this badly outdated system. That is why we want to give them access to capital markets and investors so they can obtain the best, newest, and safest technology available. And by the way, the new technology—and I've seen it—is incredible.\nIf we adopt these changes, Americans can look forward to cheaper, faster, and safer travel, a future where 20 percent of a ticket price doesn't go to the Government and where you don't have to sit on a tarmac or circle for hours and hours over an airport—which is very dangerous also—before you land.\nDozens of countries have already made similar changes with terrific results. And we're going to top them, actually, by a long shot. Canada, as an example, modernized their air traffic control through a nongovernment organization about 20 years ago, and they have cut costs significantly, adopted cutting-edge technology, and handled 50 percent more traffic and, actually, far more than that on a relative basis compared to us.\nA modern air traffic control system will make life better for all Americans who travel, ship, or fly. It will reduce cost and increase convenience for every American consumer, and these new efficiencies will produce a huge economic boost for the country and for the 1 in 14 American jobs that aviation supports.\nToday we are taking the first important step to clearing the runway for more jobs, lower prices, and much, much, much better transportation. America is the nation that pioneered air travel, and with these reforms, we can once again lead the way far into the future. Our Nation will move faster, fly higher, and soar proudly toward the next great chapter of American aviation.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nOkay, Mr. Chairman, I have a feeling that she's just going to get the first pen. What do you think? What do you think?\nRep. William F. Shuster. Your leadership on this is—[inaudible].\nThe President. Thank you so much. We'll save you money in the first year.\n[At this point, the President signed a statement outlining his principles for reforming the U.S. air traffic control system, as well as a letter to congressional leaders transmitting the statement. He then handed the pen to Rep. Shuster, in his capacity as Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.]\nOkay? Is that all right? [Laughter] The big question is who's getting the second pen? [Laughter]\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin O. McCarthy. Secretary Chao.\nSenator R. Edward \"Ted\" Cruz. Secretary Chao.\nThe President. I think so too.\nSecretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao. Senator Cruz and Leader—— The President. You're giving up your pen? Whoa.\nSec. Chao. To someone more important. [Laughter]\nParticipant. I said she was politically savvy.\n[The President handed the second pen to Sen. Cruz.]\nThe President. Okay? Where's our leader? Yes, give me another pen, please. Just get another pen. I've got to give Kevin a pen.\nRep. Shuster. Okay, great. Could I get you to actually—you visited these people's plant—[inaudible]—the mother of whom is turning 100. I was wondering if you could just——\nThe President. He's got me signing autographs now. [Laughter]\nRep. Shuster. He toured this plant, a 175-year-old plant in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania: McClanahans. It's still in operation, the McClanahans still run it, and the mother-in-law is turning 100.\nSen. Cruz. This is constituent service at its best. [Laughter]\nThe President. That's okay. This one too, right?\nRep. Shuster. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you, my friend.

Each year, our ATC system contributes $1.5 trillion to our economy—roughly 5 percent of our gross domestic product. To protect and improve this critical infrastructure asset, we must focus more attention on our ATC system and enact much needed reforms.\nDespite using 1960s technology and operating in outdated facilities, United States air traffic controllers remain the best in the world. Every day, they safely manage the largest, most complex airspace system in the world. As air traffic has increased, however, the FAA has had to sacrifice system efficiency to maintain safe operations.\nOur Nation's air traffic is only going to increase, and today's ATC system simply will not be able to handle the volume that is expected over the next two decades. Without immediate attention to comprehensive ATC reform, aviation congestion and delays—which already cost the United States economy more than $25 billion per year—will worsen and our economy will further suffer.\nThe Federal Government's $1 billion per year investment in the NextGen Program's improved ATC technology has proven insufficient. Unfortunately, political interference, budget uncertainty, and a bureaucratic government procurement system have continued to impede modernization efforts. The NextGen Program was originally estimated to cost $40 billion. By the Inspector General's most recent estimates, however, it may cost an additional $80 billion to complete. By the time it is fully operational, the technology may already be obsolete.\nEfficient operation of our airspace requires significant investments in rapidly evolving technology. In this environment, bureaucratic efforts are unlikely to succeed. That is why all other industrialized countries, with the exceptions of the United States and France, have separated their ATC functions from government. By taking that critical step, those countries have accelerated modernization, maintained or improved safety, and lowered operating costs.\nWe must take bold action now to preserve the competitive economic advantage in the world economy that our ATC system provides. The enclosed proposal describes a new, not-for-profit ATC entity that will leverage private capital to enable faster modernization and immediate safety and operational improvements for all users of the system, from passengers to shippers to operators.\nI look forward to working with you to enact these important reforms into law.\nSincerely,\nDONALD J. TRUMP", "timestamp": "2017-06-05", "title": "Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting Principles for Reforming the Air Traffic Control System"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "An original was not available for verification of the content of this statement.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=125946", "text": "Overview\nThe United States Air Traffic Control (ATC) system is one of the most important and vibrant elements of our Nation's infrastructure. Every day, the dedicated men and women of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) safely and efficiently guide thousands of aircraft to and from their destinations, collectively carrying millions of passengers and tons of cargo. Yet, the FAA's ATC operations are currently mired within a Federal bureaucracy that hinders innovative operations and the timely introduction of new technology. In order to modernize our ATC system, the Administration supports moving the FAA's ATC operations into a new non-governmental entity. This will enable ATC to keep pace with the accelerating rate of change in the aviation industry, including the integration of new entrants such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Commercial Space Transports. A more nimble ATC entity will also be able to more quickly and securely implement Next Generation (NextGen) technology, which will reduce aircraft delays and expand the availability of the National Airspace System (NAS) for all users.\nATC reform presents an exciting infrastructure improvement opportunity, and its completion will demonstrate early progress toward much needed infrastructure reform across all sectors. The Administration's principles for reforming ATC will drive legislation that will reduce delays, further improve aviation's leading safety record, protect access to rural communities, and accelerate much needed capital investment. These principles insulate one of our most important national assets from political interferences and the crippling effects of budget uncertainty, while keeping intact FAA's critical safety oversight. Additionally, they preserve essential working relationships and interoperable capabilities with the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and law enforcement agencies that are critical to ensuring the safety and security of the Nation.\nThis proposal demonstrates that the Federal Government does not have to supply all of the resources required to develop and maintain our Nation's vast infrastructure. Often, it simply needs to remove obstacles hindering investment and innovation. The new ATC entity envisioned in these reform principles will be self-sustaining, financed through fees paid by the users of the NAS. These fees will be more efficient and less burdensome than the patchwork of aviation taxes that supports the system today.\nThe time has come to embrace a bolder vision of what our Nation's ATC system can be and how best to move forward to achieve it. In 2016, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster introduced the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act to move ATC from the Government to a not-for-profit, independent entity. The Administration supports the proposed AIRR Act as a good foundation for reforming the ATC system, and believes the legislation can be improved. Accordingly, the Administration supports the enactment of legislation that incorporates the principles detailed in this document.\nThe Principles\nSafety: The FAA's appropriate role is the inherently governmental function of safety regulator. Removing ATC operations from the FAA would further this principle, and bring it in line with the recommended practice of the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) and the approach used by the majority of developed aviation states around the world. Aviation safety regulation would remain within the Department of Transportation, and the FAA would migrate to a performance-based framework responsible for providing effective oversight of the new ATC entity.\nNational Security: Protecting our Nation's security is of paramount importance. Accordingly, the new ATC entity must provide airspace access, prioritization, integration, cooperation, navigation, and information management services and support at levels of quality that ensure sustained national security and law enforcement capabilities. This must be done at no cost to the Federal Government. The new entity must develop interoperability plans, procedures, policies, and programs that ensure it can operate effectively, under all circumstances, with DoD. The new entity must also be able to work under DHS control in exigent circumstances involving physical, adversarial, and technological threats and circumstances. The Federal Government would indemnify the new entity for costs incurred in connection with operations that support Federal national security and law enforcement activities.\nCybersecurity: The new ATC system must be secure, robust, and resilient. Components will fail, but those failures must not significantly affect the ATC system's ability to provide safe and effective operation at peak capacity. Additionally, as part of our Nation's critical infrastructure, the new ATC system must be able to detect and defeat malicious cyber-based efforts to manipulate or degrade its operations.\nAccess: The new ATC entity must maintain open access for all users of the airspace and, specifically, those in rural communities, general aviation users, and the military.\n• Open Access: All users, including the general aviation industry and emerging new entrants, must have open access to our Nation's airspace. The FAA would continue to certify new entrants (such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Commercial Space Transports) as part of its responsibility to oversee safe use of the NAS. The new ATC entity would grant FAA-certified users access to the NAS, subject to their participation in the system's user fees, their being equipped, as necessary, to fly in controlled air space, and their compliance with other applicable rules and regulations. • Rural Access: The new entity must maintain access and services to rural communities and general aviation users. • Military Access: To ensure safe and effective execution of military missions, the new ATC entity must ensure continued military access to delegated Special Activity Airspace (e.g., Military Training Routes, Military Operating Areas, Warning Areas, and Restricted Areas); be capable of enforcing temporary airspace restrictions; and meet national security airspace requirements for DoD training, testing, and exercises.\nNoise: Efficient use of the airspace requires new technology and efficient air routes. The new ATC entity must have the authority, after seeking public comment, to adjust airspace routes. The proposed route change would only be subject to National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review if the change exceeds the FAA-established noise threshold. The FAA would still be responsible for ensuring—within a reasonable period of time, like 120 days—that any proposed route change does not create a safety hazard.\nNew Entity: America's growing aviation system demands a new, independent, non-government organization to operate our Nation's airspace. The new entity should have access to capital markets in order to spur capital investment, technology adoption, and innovation faster, more effectively, and securely. Over the last 20 years, more than 50 countries have already successfully transitioned their ATC operations.\n• Transition Period: The transfer of ATC operations from the FAA to the new entity should be completed within an established 3-year transition period overseen by the Secretary of Transportation. The transition period should be marked by milestones developed and monitored by the Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, to ensure adequate progress. The transition period may be extended only with the approval of the President. • Not-For-Profit Entity: The new ATC entity should be a not-for-profit, non-governmental entity. • Fees: The new ATC entity should be financially self-sufficient through the collection of user fees that cover both its costs of operations and recapitalization. The aviation taxes that currently cover these costs should be sunset, except for those necessary to continue to fund the Airport Improvement Program. General fund revenues should fund the rest of the FAA. Users should have input in the fees and their structure, which should be guided by ICAO principles and be consistent with the international obligations of the United States. Except national-security users (including DoD aircraft, DoD-contracted flights, and foreign military aircraft), diplomatic users (including non-commercial United States Government and foreign sovereign State aircraft), and public safety users, all users should pay their fair share. To ensure that rates are just and reasonable, however, users should have the ability to request review by the Secretary of Transportation, rather than the Congress. Any determination by the Secretary of Transportation should be final. • Financial Authority: The new ATC entity should have the authority to borrow funds and enter into contracts, leases, and other arrangements during and after the transition period. The new entity should also have the authority to procure goods and services, hire employees, and to bond or pledge future revenues to fulfill the terms of financial arrangements and other transactions. Additionally, the new entity should have the authority to sell or transfer its assets. • Assets: All assets currently owned by the FAA and used in the operation of ATC should be transferred, at no charge, to the new ATC entity. The users of the ATC system have already paid for those assets and should not be charged for them again. The assets should be transferred along with any environmental liabilities associated with them. Accordingly, sufficient funds to account for those liabilities should also be transferred to the new entity. • Governance: A professional Board of Directors should manage the new ATC. The members of the Board should have a fiduciary responsibility solely to the new ATC entity and be free of any financial conflict of interest. Board seats should not be reserved for any entity, except for the ATC entity's Chief Executive Officer, who would serve as a representative of the new entity. The new entity should represent all users impartially, and no group should have even the appearance of influence over the Board. The Board should ensure that DoD and national-security equities are adequately represented and that the entity maintains appropriate relationships with national and international air navigation service providers and forums. To establish the initial Board, the Secretary of Transportation should select eight members from candidate lists provided by five nominating groups. The nominating groups should be airlines, unions, general aviation, airports, and the Department of Transportation. Each nominating group would provide lists of six to ten qualified persons to the Secretary. • United States-based carriers with annual revenues greater than $10 billion should develop the airline list. • Unions representing at least 50 percent of FAA employees that would transfer to the new ATC entity or representing more than 10,000 United States commercial pilots should develop the union list. • The two largest trade groups representing general aviation (Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) and National Business Aviation Association (NBAA)), should jointly develop the general aviation list. • The two largest trade groups representing United States airports (Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA) and American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE)), should develop the airport list.\nTwo members should be selected from the airline list, two members should be selected from the union list, one member should be selected from the general aviation list, one member should be selected from the airport list, and two members should be selected from the Department of Transportation list. Those eight initial Board members would then select a Chief Executive Officer. Those nine Board members would then select four independent Board members. The 13-member Board would be constituted for at least the transition period, plus the first year of operation. After this time, decisions about Board constitution and members' terms should be left to the discretion of the Board. Once the initial Board members are nominated, no group should have an exclusive right to name successor Board members.\n• Labor: The new ATC entity should honor existing labor agreements. Employees who transition to the new entity will no longer be Federal employees, but they should be held harmless and have similar rights to those they had as Federal employees at the FAA. Consistent with those rights, employees of the new entity should not be permitted to strike. • Spectrum: The new ATC entity should not be charged for its use of spectrum, as the FAA is not charged for spectrum use today. The new entity will occupy spectrum shared with Federal entities. The new entity, however, could be required to vacate existing spectrum band (at some point) and move to another frequency along with other Federal entities. In any future spectrum reallocation, the new entity should be treated as a Federal entity, including with respect to the use of any reallocation auction proceeds to finance relocation expenses. Relocation expenses could include those associated with the development, procurement, and installation of new radar systems that are interoperable with government systems on a different spectrum band.", "timestamp": "2017-06-05", "title": "Statement on Principles for Reforming the United States Air Traffic Control System"}

To Carl Anderson, to Archbishop Broglio, Mother Olga, Bishop Dorsonville, Secretary Nicholson, distinguished members of Congress, and honored guests, I am so honored to join you for the 13th Annual National Catholic Prayer Breakfast. Thank you all for being here. (Applause.)\nAnd it's early in the day, but I promise you, he starts early. (Laughter.) And I bring greetings from my friend, a man who appreciates the extraordinary contributions of Catholic Americans, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nBefore I go much further, first and foremost, let me begin this morning by expressing the sorrow of our entire administration and all the American people for the horrific terror attacks this weekend in London and with word this morning of another terrorist attack in Melbourne, Australia.\nOur hearts break for the families of the victims and the injured -- just the latest innocents to suffer at the hands of terrorists, joining those in Manchester, in Kabul, in Paris, in Istanbul, Brussels, Berlin, San Bernardino. They have our prayers. They have our unwavering resolve.\nAs the President said two nights ago, this bloodshed must end and this bloodshed will end. (Applause.)\nBut to be with you today is deeply meaningful to me. I'm truly honored to join this year's National Catholic Prayer Breakfast. My mom would be so proud. (Laughter and applause.)\nSince 2004, the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast has brought together leaders in the Church, leaders in public life, leaders from across the globe to live out Saint John Paul the Second's call for a \"New Evangelization\", and to rekindle the flame of faith that gives comfort to the weary and lights the world with its glow. This honestly feels like coming home to me. (Applause.)\nI'm the son of two devout American Catholics, and the grandson and the namesake of an Irish immigrant and his wonderful wife. And I just learned from Father Jenkins at Notre Dame, where I had the opportunity to speak, as Carl told you, that even though my official biography says I was raised in a large Catholic family, I'm actually from a mid-sized Catholic family -- only six children in the family I grew up. (Laughter.)\nThe hymns and liturgies of the Catholic Church are the anthems of my youth. The Bible says \"train up a child in the way he should go, and when he's old, he'll not depart from it.\"\nI want to tell you as a young boy growing up in a small town in southern Indiana, my Catholic faith poured an eternal foundation in my life. I did eight years of hard time at Catholic school. (Laughter.) The name Sister Rachel still sends a shiver down my spine. (Laughter.) Honestly, I was the beneficiary of an extraordinary Catholic education, went to public high school. But that foundation continues to serve and inform me every day.\nI was one of four boys and two girls. But being one of four boys was very convenient for Father Gleason (ph), because he could call my dad in a pinch and have a full team of altar boys ready for any mass. (Laughter.) So we lost count of the number of times we were rousted from bed early at the Sunday because there had been cancellations. But it was very special.\nI was not only baptized in the Church, but I was confirmed, and I stand before you today as Michael Richard Christopher Pence. (Applause.)\nWhile my own faith journey has taken me and my family in a different direction, I want you all to know how much I cherish my Catholic upbringing and cherish the Church. In fact, I just attended mass with my mom this weekend when we were in Chicago with family.\nI really grew up with a front-row seat to the Catholic faith and all that it means to families and to communities. It gave me a deep appreciation for the Church's rich contributions to the fabric of American life.\nThe truth is Catholicism is woven deep into that fabric. It gives America a vitality and vibrancy that inspires everyone who sees it -- to this very day.\nEven from the hour of our nation's birth, the Catholic Church was there. The last signer of the Declaration of Independence to pass away was the only Catholic signer, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, Maryland.\nHis cousin, John, served as the first bishop and archbishop of the Catholic Church in the United States.\nWhat began as a trickle became a deluge in American history, as waves of Catholic immigrants -- like my grandfather -- from places like Ireland, from Italy, from Germany, and indeed, from across the wider world made landfall in America, drawn here by the promise of freedom, of opportunity, prosperity; and most of all, it was the freedom to practice their faith that is the birthright of every American.\nAnd now our history books are filled with the names of the sons and daughters of the Catholic Church. And as the Bible says, we recognize them by their fruits. There are among us here today some distinguished men and women in public life, in public service who are emblematic of that contribution. And I'm honored to be able to address you all.\nAmerican Catholics have built everything that matters in this country -- build families, build businesses, founded hospitals, ministered to the poor, become leaders in public life, established world-class institutions of higher education, and so many other countless contributions to America.\nAnd maybe most importantly Catholics have worn the uniform of the United States of America in every conflict in American history since our nation's founding. (Applause.)\nAnd American Catholics and their family continue to participate in our armed forces to this very moment. At this very time in far-flung places in the world, men and women that have grown up in the heart of Catholic families are wearing the uniform and serving our country, and we honor them.\nWe also honor those who have served. And would all those who are present here today who have worn the uniform of the United States of America, would those men and women please stand up and allow us to thank you for your service and putting teeth on your faith in defending our freedom? (Applause.)\nThank you for your service.\nCatholicism has made an indelible mark on the American spirit. Your faith has moved mountains, and the Catholic Church and its millions of parishioners have been a force for good in our communities, large and small, throughout our land, throughout our history.\nTo all the great American Catholics gathered here, let me assure you this morning, bright and early at this prayer breakfast, American Catholics have an ally in President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump stands for the religious liberty of every American and the right of our people of faith to live out your convictions in the public square.\nPresident Trump stands with those who are persecuted for their faith around the world -- no matter the country they call home or the creed they profess.\nAnd President Donald Trump stands with the most vulnerable -- the aged, the infirm, and the unborn. (Applause.)\nOn the first count, I can assure you this President believes that no American should have to violate their conscience to fully participate in American life. (Applause.) And he has not just talked about it, he has taken action to protect men and women of faith in the public square.\nJust last month, the Little Sisters of the Poor were at the White House, and on that day, I had the high honor to stand as President Trump signed an executive order to restore religious liberty in the public square. I couldn't have been more proud. (Applause.)\nAs inspired as I was by the President's actions, I was even more inspired by the Little Sisters of the Poor. They took a big stand for faith and freedom, and they prevailed. Would we give the Little Sisters of the Poor a big round of applause for the stand they took on behalf of all our faith? (Applause.)\nSpeaking from the Rose Garden, President Trump declared in his words that the \"federal government will never, ever penalize any person for their protected religious beliefs,\" and he directed the Department of Justice to \"develop new rules\" to protect Americans of faith in the public square.\nAnd I can promise you, President Trump will continue to fight to ensure that every American has the freedom to follow the dictates of their conscience and add their voices and their values to the beautiful tapestry of America's national life. (Applause.)\nAnd this President stands for religious liberty in America and across the wider world. Just last month, President Trump traveled across the Middle East and Europe, where I know he was deeply honored and moved to have the opportunity to meet with the Holy Father, Pope Francis.\nThe President and the Pope had a lengthy and meaningful discussion about issues facing our world, about how our nation and the Church can work together to address them -- especially the persecution of people of faith across the wider world.\nIn Saudi Arabia, only a few days earlier on the world stage, President Trump had condemned in his words, \"the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews,\" and he condemned \"the slaughter of Christians\" across the wider Arab world. (Applause.)\nThis is a President who knows that terrorism is an existential threat to people of faith in countries around the globe. Terrorist groups seek to stamp out all religions that are not their own, or not their version of their own, and believers of many backgrounds have suffered grievously at their hands. And we acknowledge all of that loss and suffering.\nBut it seems that the practitioners of terror harbor a special hatred for the followers of Christ, and none more so than the barbarians known as ISIS.\nThat brutal regime shows a savagery unseen in the Middle East since the Middle Ages, and I believe ISIS is guilty of nothing short of genocide. (Applause.)\nIn Egypt, we have just recently seen Coptic Christians martyred on their way to a monastery, bombs exploded in churches amidst Palm Sunday celebrations -- a day of hope transformed into a day of pain and suffering.\nIn Iraq, we see ancient churches demolished, priests and monks beheaded, and the two-millennia-old Christian tradition in Mosul virtually extinguished.\nIn Syria, we see Christian communities burned to the ground, women and children sold into the most terrible form of slavery. Christianity faces unprecedented threats in the land where it was given birth and an exodus unrivaled since the days of Moses.\nJust a few weeks ago, I had the great privilege of meeting with courageous leaders of the Syrian Catholic Church, the Syrian Orthodox Church, the Chaldean Catholic Church. I heard one story after another from them about the horrors that their parishioners face on a daily basis. But I also heard their resolve. I heard a bishop speak about returning to his home parish in Mosul and celebrating Easter Sunday. He said, there's no roof on the church. The walls are falling down. But the anthems of faith rose. It had to be a glorious service.\nIt's heartbreaking to think that the Christian population in Syria alone has plummeted from 1.25 million to only 500,000 in just the past six years. Whether in Mosul, in Iraq, or in Syria, the followers of Christ have fallen by 80 percent in the last decade and a half. This must end. This will end. (Applause.)\nCarl Anderson and the Knights of Columbus, let me just say thank you for your extraordinary work caring for the persecuted. And to Mother Olga, let me personally thank you for raising your voice on behalf of the victims of persecution in your homeland and across the Middle East.\nAnd let me promise all of you: This administration hears you. This President stands with you.\nOur administration is fully committed to bringing relief and comfort to the believers in that ancient land. And under President Donald Trump, America will continue to condemn persecution of any faith in any place at any time. We will confront it with all of our might. (Applause.)\nProtecting and promoting religious freedom is a foreign-policy priority of this administration. And we will continue to work with this Congress to stand without apology for persecuted people of faith across the globe. We will continue to stand with our allies and take the fight to the terrorists on our terms, on their soil until we drive the cancer of terrorism from the face of the Earth. (Applause.)\nAnd finally, let me say from my heart, it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President for President Donald Trump, but I couldn't be more proud to serve as Vice President to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.)\nSince day one of this administration, President Donald Trump has been keeping his promise to stand for life, and life is winning in America again.\nIn one of his very first acts in Congress, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy to prevent taxpayer funding from organizations that perform or promote abortions abroad. (Applause.)\nAnd I'm proud to say the President recently expanded that policy to cover nearly $9 billion in foreign aid.\nIn January, our President personally sent me to speak -- I guess for the first time ever for someone in one of these positions -- at the annual March for Life. (Applause.)\nAnd I got to tell you the story. I went to the March for Life that day, and I said the President sent me. Some people might have thought I just said that. But in fact, here's how it happened. We were talking earlier in the week about the calendar for the week. And the President was informed that Prime Minister May was visiting from Great Britain, our cherished ally. And so he was not going to be able even break away for a phone call, which had been the tradition of many Presidents since that day in 1973.\nAnd I was standing in the Oval Office, and the President said, oh, well, I won't be able to call. And I said rather shyly, well, if I could help in any way.\nAnd he said, really? How?\nAnd I said, well, they invited me, too. (Laughter.)\nAnd he looked up from his desk at the -- in the Oval Office. And he said, they invited you to speak?\nAnd I said, yes, sir.\nAnd he said, have you done that before?\nAnd I said, my family always went to the March for Life when I was in the Congress. I've spoken, be glad to help. (Laughter.)\nAnd the President pointed his finger at me without hesitation and said, you go. You go and you tell them we're with them. (Applause.)\nPresident Donald Trump stands with the men and women who stand for the sanctity of human life in America, and he always will. (Applause.)\nHe's actually taken even more action than I've mentioned thus far. The President actually has empowered states to withhold federal funding from abortion providers, and I'm humbled to say that at the President's direction, I had the privilege of casting the tie-breaking vote in the United States Senate that allows states to defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.)\nAnd President Trump is appointing strong conservatives to the federal courts at every level -- men and women who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution -- and that includes the newest justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, a man in the mold of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia -- Justice Neil Gorsuch. (Applause.)\nMy friends, life is winning in America. Life is winning through the steady advance of science that continues to illuminate more and more when life begins.\nLife is winning through the generosity of millions of adoptive families, who open their hearts and their homes to children in need.\nLife is winning through the compassion of caregivers and volunteers at crisis pregnancy centers and faith-based organizations, like Project Rachel, that give hope and healing to women in cities and towns across America.\nAnd life is winning in America because all of you have stood with those who stand -- from the Congress, to the White House, to statehouses across the land -- for the sanctity of human life.\nI believe we've come to a pivotal moment in the life of our nation, and indeed, the life of the world. The Catholic community in America has made an enormous difference in the life of this nation.\nAnd at this moment, I urge you to continue to stand up, to speak out, to continue to be that voice for the voiceless that the church has been throughout its history, continue to be the hands and feet of our Savior, reaching in with love and compassion, embracing the dignity of all people of every background and every experience.\nI urge you to continue to do the very things that we celebrate here this morning and to stand for the change that this nation so desperately needs, a change back to a safer America, a more prosperous America, an America standing tall in the world again for our values and our ideals -- standing with our allies and against our enemies.\nBut I ask you to do one more thing that I know that men and women of Catholic faith in this country do exceedingly well, and that is I ask you to remember to bow the head and bend the knee and to pray. In these challenging times, I encourage you to take time every day to pray.\nAnd I don't so much say to pray for a particular agenda. Although I will tell you that the sweetest words the President and I ever hear are when people reach out at an event to grab a hand and say, \"I'm praying for you.\" And we hear it a lot. Men and women of the Catholic faith in this country and of every faith in this country are people of prayer.\nI encourage you to redouble your efforts, but don't so much pray for a cause as for country. I've always been drawn to what Abraham Lincoln said when he was asked once if he thought that God was on the side of the Union Army in our great Civil War. Abraham Lincoln responded, \"I'd rather concern myself more with whether we were on God's side than whether God is on our side.\" (Applause.)\nSo just pray for America. Pray for this country because America matters.\nAnd when you pray, pray with confidence. Because I truly do believe in these divided times where there is so much focus on what we disagree on, it seems, so much need for healing, that those ancient words inscribed millennia ago that Catholic Americans and all Christian Americans and all our Jewish friends have clung to throughout the thousands of years are still true today as the day they were expressed: That if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, He'll do as He's always done throughout the long and storied history of this Church and this nation. As the Old Book says, He'll hear from heaven and He'll heal this land -- this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\nThank you very much for the honor of being with you today. (Applause.) Thank you for all the Catholic Church means to America. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

Trump today announced his intent to nominate the following individuals to key positions in his Administration:\nJeffrey Bossert Clark of Virginia to be an Assistant Attorney General, Environment and Natural Resources at the Department of Justice. Mr. Clark is a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Kirkland & Ellis LLP. He is a complex trial and appellate litigator with especially deep experience in administrative law, cutting across dozens of statutes and numerous agencies. Mr. Clark has been with Kirkland since 1996, with the exception of his period of service by virtue of appointment by the Attorney General in the U.S. Department of Justice from 2001-2005. He has worked on cutting-edge cases in numerous areas of law, and argued and won numerous cases in multiple Circuits. From 2001 to 2005, Mr. Clark was the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Justice Department.

The President endorsed spinning off air-traffic control from the Federal Aviation Administration, a decades-old idea that would improve passenger experience and safety. Mr. Trump announced principles for converting air-traffic control into a nonprofit. The new entity would be governed by a board of directors, including representatives for airlines, unions, airports and others. Instead of taxes, the outfit would be funded by user fees, which is how Canada has financed air-traffic services since 1996. The outline makes small tweaks to House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster's proposal that stalled last year. … FAA regulates itself, so a separation would end this conflict-of-interest and allow the agency to focus on safety and certification. This reform is endorsed by the International Civil Aviation Organization, and only the most cynical on the left could claim a spinoff threatens passenger safety. Democrats will say Mr. Trump is auctioning off air traffic to big business, but the principles are explicit that the entity must be a nonprofit. The outline gives airlines only two seats on the 13-member board. … Still, the more remarkable feat is how many in the industry agree on the basics: The airline trade group supports a spinoff, and last year so did the air-traffic controller's union, which said it will evaluate the specifics of any bill. Former FAA chief officers and Transportation Secretaries also signed on. That's a testament to how inefficient the current system is.\nUSA TODAY: \"President Trump's right. Privatize air traffic control.\"\nMost everyone driving a car today has instant access to apps with GPS to navigate the quickest routes through traffic. But when these same people get on a jetliner, controllers are still using radar, a system that's been around since World War II and can't take full advantage of GPS to help planes take the most efficient routes through the skies. Something's wrong with this picture, and it's the failure of the Federal Aviation Administration to make good on decades of promises to modernize air traffic control with advanced satellite-based technology in a system called \"NextGen.\" On Monday, President Trump endorsed getting the job done by creating a private, non-profit corporation that would apply business principles and provide a steady stream of financing. This change would free air traffic control modernization from two major sources of delay: the bureaucratic process used to select contractors, and Congress' crazy, on-again, off-again budget process that disrupts long-term planning. … The idea of putting a non-profit company in charge — a plan most of the major airlines have been promoting for years — has considerable merit. (The FAA would remain in charge of safety functions.) Other countries that have successfully privatized their air traffic control systems include Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom.\nTHE CHICAGO TRIBUNE: \"Getting Washington out of the air traffic control business\"\nWeather causes some flight delays and disruptions. Others have a bureaucratic origin. The nation's air traffic control system, while safe, is gummed up by antiquated technology. American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said in a recent interview that a flight from Dallas to Philadelphia takes about 30 minutes longer than in 1979 because the system is \"broken.\" There is a fix, endorsed Monday by President Donald Trump: Reshape the Federal Aviation Administration by shifting air traffic control operations to a separate, nonprofit corporation. This new entity would fund itself by charging fees instead of having to beg Congress for money. With a more predictable revenue stream, it could do a much better job investing in new technology. The FAA, meanwhile, would continue to enforce safety regulations and provide grant money to airports. Trump hopes to put momentum behind legislation circling in Congress. The best argument for this change is the new organization would — finally — be able to provide proper funding for NextGen, the long-awaited, $40 billion air traffic system upgrade. NextGen involves switching from cumbersome radar and static-prone radios to satellite-based GPS tracking of aircraft and digital communications. This is a smarter way to fly because planes could be routed along more precise flight paths. Planes could fly safely while spaced closer together, too. The result: Passengers get to their destinations more quickly.\nTHE WASHINGTON POST: \"Trump throws his support behind a good idea\"\n[T]he idea has a bipartisan pedigree going back a quarter-century to the Democratic administration of President Bill Clinton. Then-Vice President Al Gore's 1993 government-reinvention project, the National Performance Review, recommended creating a government-owned air traffic control corporation supported by user fees and governed by stakeholders. Except for the precise ownership structure, that's essentially what Mr. Shuster's bill proposes. Like Mr. Gore's version, it would retain a robust safety regulation role for the FAA; whether nominally public or private, the main advantage of a separate, self-governing nonprofit entity is to end the constant political bickering in Congress over the FAA's budget, thus freeing the entity to pursue much-needed technological modernization without worrying about government shutdowns and other hassles.", "timestamp": "2017-06-06", "title": "Press Release - Editorial Boards Praise President Donald J.

Hensarling, R-TX)\nThe Administration is committed to reforming the Nation's financial system. On February 3, 2017, the President signed Executive Order 13772, Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System. The Administration's Core Principles include: (1) preventing taxpayer-funded bailouts; (2) fostering economic growth; (3) making regulation efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored; and (4) restoring public accountability within Federal financial regulatory agencies.\nThe substitute amendment to H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act, reflects the Administration's Core Principles in several key respects. It aims to eliminate taxpayer bailouts, simplify regulation, hold financial regulators accountable, and foster economic growth by facilitating capital formation. In particular, H.R. 10 would allow well-capitalized banking organizations to opt out of certain regulatory requirements, affirm the President's authority to remove the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) at will, subject the CFPB to the congressional appropriations process, require broader use of cost-benefit analysis by financial regulators, and provide regulatory relief for community financial institutions. The Administration supports these provisions, and looks forward to working with Congress to undo additional mandates from the Dodd-Frank law that unnecessarily raise costs and limit choices for consumers.\nThe Administration's on-going review of financial regulation, including the reviews of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Executive Order 13772, may yield additional views with respect to other provisions of H.R. 10.\nThe Administration thanks Chairman Jeb Hensarling for his leadership on the important issues addressed by the Financial CHOICE Act. The Administration supports passage of the substitute amendment to H.R. 10 as a necessary and important step in moving financial reform legislation through the Congress.

In this context, the United States has deployed combat-equipped forces to enhance the counterterrorism capabilities and support the counterterrorism operations of our partners and allies. Specific information about counterterrorism deployments to select countries is provided below, and a classified annex to this report provides further information.\nMilitary Operations against al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and Associated Forces and in Support of Related United States Counterterrorism Objectives\nSince October 7, 2001, U.S. Armed Forces, including Special Operations Forces, have conducted counterterrorism combat operations in Afghanistan against al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and associated forces. Since August 2014, these operations have targeted the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which was formerly known as al-Qa'ida in Iraq. In support of these and other overseas operations, the United States has deployed combat-equipped forces to a number of locations in the U.S. Central, European, Africa, Southern, and Pacific Commands' areas of responsibility. Such operations and deployments have been reported previously, consistent with Public Law 107-40 and the War Powers Resolution, and operations and deployments remain ongoing. These operations, which the United States has carried out with the assistance of numerous international partners, have been successful in seriously degrading al-Qa'ida's capabilities. If necessary, in response to terrorist threats, I will direct additional measures to protect United States citizens and interests. It is not possible to know at this time the precise scope or the duration of the deployments of U.S. Armed Forces necessary to counter terrorist threats to the United States.\nAfghanistan. U.S. Armed Forces have transitioned the lead for security to Afghan security forces while striking significant blows against al-Qa'ida's leadership and preventing Afghanistan from being used to launch attacks against the United States. United States forces remain in Afghanistan for the purposes of, among other things, training, advising, and assisting Afghan forces; conducting and supporting counterterrorism operations against the remnants of core al-Qa'ida and against ISIS; and taking appropriate measures against those who directly threaten United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan or provide direct support to al-Qa'ida. The United States remains in an armed conflict, including against the Taliban, and active hostilities remain ongoing. The mission to help train, advise, and assist the Afghan National Defense Security Forces and Afghan ministries and institutions continues through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-led Resolute Support Mission. The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2189, dated December 12, 2014, which welcomed the Resolute Support Mission and underscored the importance of continued international support for the stability of Afghanistan.\nThe Force Management Level for U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan currently is 8,448. (The actual number of United States military personnel may exceed the Force Management Level due to certain forces being excluded from counting against the Force Management Level; for example, incoming and outgoing forces that overlap during rotations of units do not count against the Force Management Level.)\nIraq and Syria. As part of a comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIS, U.S. Armed Forces are conducting a systematic campaign of airstrikes and other necessary operations against ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria. U.S. Armed Forces are also conducting airstrikes and other necessary operations against al-Qa'ida in Syria. In Iraq, U.S. Armed Forces are advising and coordinating with Iraqi forces and providing training, equipment, communications support, intelligence support, and other support to select elements of the Iraqi security forces, including Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Additionally, United States forces are deployed to Syria to help coordinate United States operations with indigenous ground forces conducting operations against ISIS. The Force Management Level for U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq currently is 5,262. The Force Management Level for U.S. Armed Forces in Syria is 503. Actions in Iraq are being undertaken in coordination with the Government of Iraq, and in conjunction with coalition partners.\nOn May 18, 2017, United States forces participating in the defeat-ISIS mission near At Tanf, Syria, were threatened by forces believed to be supporting the Syrian government. After employing appropriate measures seeking to de-escalate the situation, United States forces struck the forces in response to the threat to United States personnel.\nYemen. The United States military continues to work closely with the Government of Yemen and regional partner forces to dismantle and ultimately eliminate the terrorist threat posed by al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Our efforts since the last periodic update report have included a number of airstrikes and two raids against AQAP operatives and facilities.\nJordan. At the request of the Government of Jordan, approximately 2,850 United States military personnel are deployed to Jordan to support defeat-ISIS operations and the security of Jordan and to promote regional stability. These forces will remain in Jordan, in full coordination with the Government of Jordan, until the security situation becomes such that they are no longer needed.\nTurkey. United States forces, including strike and combat support aircraft with associated United States military personnel, remain deployed to Turkey to support defeat-ISIS operations and to support the defense of Turkey, at the Turkish government's request.\nEast Africa Region. In Somalia, United States forces continue to counter the terrorist threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its Somalia-based associated force, al-Shabaab, and ISIS-Somalia. United States forces also advise, assist, and accompany regional forces, including Somali and African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) forces, during counterterrorism operations. Additional United States forces are deployed to Kenya to support counterterrorism operations in East Africa.\nDjibouti. United States forces continue to partner with Government of Djibouti authorities, which have permitted use of Djiboutian territory for basing of United States forces. United States forces remain deployed to Djibouti, including for purposes of posturing for counterterrorism and counter-piracy operations in the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula and contingency support for embassy security augmentation in East Africa, as required.\nLibya. United States forces conducted airstrikes—beginning in May 2016—against ISIS targets in Libya, including in support of efforts by forces aligned with the Libyan Government of National Accord to recapture the city of Sirte from ISIS, until December 19, 2016. United States forces reinitiated airstrikes against ISIS targets south of Sirte for a limited period, from January 18 to January 19, 2017. These airstrikes were conducted at the request of and with the consent of the Government of National Accord.\nLake Chad Basin Region. United States military personnel in the Lake Chad Basin continue to provide a wide variety of support to African partners conducting counterterrorism operations in the region. In Niger, there are approximately 645 United States military personnel deployed to support these missions. In Cameroon, approximately 300 United States military personnel are also deployed, the bulk of whom are supporting United States airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations in the region. These forces are equipped with weapons for the purpose of providing their own force protection and security, and they will remain in Cameroon, with the consent of the Government of Cameroon, until their support is no longer needed.\nCuba. Combat-equipped forces, deployed since January 2002 to the Naval Base, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, continue to conduct humane and secure detention operations for detainees held at Guantánamo Bay under the authority provided by the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40), as informed by the law of war. There were 41 such detainees as of the date of this report.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY\nBeginning in 2011, United States military personnel with appropriate combat equipment deployed to various countries in the central Africa region to serve as advisors to regional forces of the African Union Regional Task Force working to apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and other senior Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) leaders from the battlefield and to protect local populations. The United States military counter-LRA mission ended on April 26, 2017. United States military personnel remaining in Uganda, the Republic of South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic are conducting retrograde activities. The number of United States military personnel still deployed to those countries in the central Africa region is approximately 410.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS IN SYRIA\nAs I previously reported, on April 6, 2017, at my direction, United States forces in the Mediterranean Sea operating beyond the territorial sea of any state struck the Shayrat military airfield in Syria. These strikes were in response to the chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians in southern Idlib Province, Syria, on April 4, 2017.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS IN EGYPT Approximately 700 military personnel are assigned to or supporting the United States contingent of the Multinational Force and Observers, which have been present in Egypt since 1981.\nMILITARY OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE SECURITY OF UNITED STATES CITIZENS AND PROPERTY IN SOUTH SUDAN\nMy predecessor previously reported the deployment of United States military personnel with appropriate combat equipment to South Sudan to support the security of United States citizens and property in South Sudan, including of our Embassy in Juba. That military mission ended in late January 2017.\nUNITED STATES/NATO OPERATIONS IN KOSOVO\nThe United Nations Security Council authorized Member States to establish a NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Resolution 1244 on June 10, 1999. The original mission of KFOR was to monitor, verify, and, when necessary, enforce compliance with the Military Technical Agreement between NATO and the then-Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (now Serbia), while maintaining a safe and secure environment. Today, KFOR deters renewed hostilities in cooperation with local authorities, bilateral partners, and international institutions. The principal military tasks of KFOR forces are to help maintain a safe and secure environment and to ensure freedom of movement throughout Kosovo. The United States contribution to KFOR is approximately 660 United States military personnel out of the total strength of approximately 4,080 personnel.\nI have directed the participation of U.S. Armed Forces in all of these operations pursuant to my constitutional and statutory authority as Commander in Chief and as Chief Executive (including the authority to carry out Public Law 107-40 and other statutes), as well as my constitutional and statutory authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States. Officials of my Administration and I communicate regularly with the leadership and other Members of Congress with regard to these deployments and we will continue to do so.\nSincerely,\nDONALD J.

What a great team this is. What an unbelievable team. We'll know soon. [Laughter] We have a great team. And it's wonderful to be here this afternoon with the Republican leadership House and Senate, including Speaker Ryan, Leader McConnell, Leader McCarthy, Senator Cornyn, Representative Scalise. Thank you all for being here. I greatly appreciate it.\nIn just a short time, the election—since the election, we have achieved truly incredible gains for the American people. We've already added more than 1 million new jobs, and it's going up very fast—you see the new reports coming out; going up very, very fast—and approved a historic increase in military spending. We have increased the stock market values and values of corporations on the public markets by $3.4 trillion since November 8.\nI've signed 36 bills into law and repealed one job-crushing regulation after another. In fact, the House and Senate have set a record number of resolutions that eliminate regulations to my desk for signature, saving our economy many billions of dollars annually. And in fact, based on the numbers we just got, the actual number is approximately $18 billion we've saved annually with all of the bills that I've signed. So that's a great job. Great job, Mitch, and everybody—Paul.\nTogether, we'll fight for promised measures on the border. And we have fought very successfully. We have tough policies to keep deadly drugs and the vicious gangs out of the country. MS-13 is being taken care of at a very, very rapid clip by General—now Secretary—Kelly. He's done an incredible job, really incredible job.\nAnd we're down—reduction on people pouring through our border, down 78 percent as of now—78 percent. It used to be, if you got down 1 percent, it was a good job. We're down 78 percent. That's before we have the wall. The wall will be a great help. And that will happen, believe me.\nMy administration is also working with Congress to rebuild our infrastructure. We'll be discussing that at great—in great depth next week with Gary Cohn and with Steve Mnuchin and with Mike Pence and everybody else working on it. And to pass a massive tax cut, which will be the biggest tax cut in our country's history if it's passed the way we'd like to have it passed. It will be the biggest tax cut in our country's history, and it will spur business like never before.\nAt the core of this agenda is repealing and replacing the disaster known as Obamacare. Average Obamacare premiums have more than doubled from 2013 to 2017, including an increase of 203 percent in Alaska. Wow, that's a new one. I always use Arizona at 116—[laughter]—I got stuck at 116 percent. Now we're at 203. That's pretty big. One-twenty-three in Louisiana—these are the new numbers, folks. I think after a year of talking about 116 percent in Arizona, you'll be happy to hear we have some new numbers. And 176 percent in North Carolina, a great State.\nInsurance carriers are fleeing and leaving many Americans with only one insurer or even no insurers to choose from. And that's been happening now in numerous States. And just this afternoon we learned the last statewide insurer in the great State of Ohio is leaving. So they don't have any insurers. That means another 20 counties in the State of Ohio will have no health care plan.\nIf Congress doesn't act to save Americans from this Democrat-inflicted catastrophe, next year is only going to get worse. It's going to get a lot worse. Although I don't know how it can get worse than 203 percent, but I'm sure the Democrats will find a way. [Laughter]\nAlmost every major insurer has already pulled out for 2018. The House took an important first step to rescue Americans from this calamity when, Paul, you and your group, and Steve, and everybody passed the American Health Care Act. And that was a very, very long and difficult negotiation, but it really gives a great print and a great concept to Mitch. And now the Senate, I'm sure, will follow suit and get a bill across the finish line this summer that will be great health care for Americans. And I'm looking forward to seeing it, so looking forward to seeing it.\nSo we're working very hard on our massive tax cuts, and we're working very, very hard on the health care. And I think we're going to have some very pleasant surprises for a lot of people.\nSo I'd like to thank the leadership for being with us. Mike Pence, you've been great, and I appreciate you being here. Steve, great. I appreciate everyone. Jared—Jared has actually become much more famous than me. [Laughter] I'm a little bit upset about that. So I want to thank everybody very much for being here, and let's get to work. We're going to get to work and get it done. Thank you all very much.\nFormer Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr.\nQ. Mr. President, what message do you have for Comey ahead of his testimony?\nThe President. Thank you.

Trump\nCRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE: America's infrastructure is out of date and falling apart, particularly the internal waterways that are so vital for transporting the country's goods.\n* The Obama Administration's attempt to rebuild the country's infrastructure was an expensive waste that saw little money actually go to infrastructure.\n* Less than 10 percent of stimulus money was dedicated to rebuilding infrastructure.\n* Of $836 billion in stimulus spending, just $28 billion went to highways, $8 billion to water systems, $5 billion to the Army Corps of Engineers, and $1 billion to airports.\n* Billions were spent on projects that still have not been completed after years of development or were of little actual value.\n* The waterways of the United States are vital for its industry and economic growth of the country, transporting everything from corn to steel and coal.\n* According to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), our inland waterways delivered more than 575 million tons of cargo, valued at $229 billion.\n* According to the Department of Transportation, inland waterways support more than 270,000 jobs and $30.9 billion in economic activity.\n* 60 percent of the grain meant for export uses inland waterways to reach the Gulf of Mexico.\n* American steel production is entirely dependent on the inland waterways system.\n* Up to 25 percent of the country's energy cargo, including coal, and petroleum, are moved on inland waterways.\n* The infrastructure of America's inland waterways has been allowed to fall apart, causing delays and preventing the United States from achieving its economic potential.\n* According to the ASCE, most of the locks and dams needed to travel the internal waterways are past their 50-year lifespan and nearly 50 percent of voyages suffered delays.\n* Our inland waterway system requires $8.7 billion in maintenance and the maintenance backlog is only getting worse.\nREBUILDING AMERICA: President Donald J. Trump is pushing to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States by partnering with the private sector and getting government out of the way.\n* President Trump will spur growth and investment in infrastructure by dramatically reducing permitting time for projects from 10 years to 2 years and slashing regulations to speed up the decision making process.\n* The President has dedicated $200 billion in his budget as part of a $1 trillion investment plan to rebuild infrastructure.\n* Transformative projects to bring the country's infrastructure into the 21st century will be funded through a mixture of loans and grants, such as air traffic control privatization.\n* Rural America will receive grants to rebuild crippled bridges, roads, and waterways.\n* States and cities will receive grants to meet their own infrastructure challenges.\n* Qualified projects of regional and national significance, such as those created under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, will receive loans.\n* Government will get out of the way to allow State and local governments to succeed at meeting their unique challenges.\n* Only 1/5 of infrastructure spending comes from the Federal Government, the vast majority comes from states, localities, and the private sector.\nPROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: President Trump is following through on his promise to rebuild the country.\n* On September 15, 2016, then-candidate Trump:\n* \"Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure.\"\n* \"We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools, and hospitals.\"", "timestamp": "2017-06-07", "title": "Press Release - President Donald J.

To Governor Abbott, to Senator Cruz, Congressman and Chairman Lamar Smith, Congressman and Chairman Brian Babin, to our great acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot, Director Ellen Ochoa, to distinguished guests, to all the NASA team here at Johnson Space Center, I can't tell you how privileged and honored I feel today to be able to congratulate the newest class of American heroes, the 2017 Class of America's Astronauts. (Applause.)\nThese are 12 men and women whose personal excellence and whose personal courage will carry our nation to even greater heights of discovery and who I know will inspire our children and our grandchildren every bit as much as your forebears have done so in this storied American program.\nAnd to this newest class of astronauts, it's my honor to bring the sincere congratulations of the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nYour President is proud of you, and so am I. And President Donald Trump is firmly committed to NASA's noble mission leading America in space. (Applause.)\nEarlier this year, after the signing of the first NASA Authorization Act in seven years, the President renewed in his words our national commitment to \"NASA's mission of exploration and discovery\". The President actually said that we must have, in his words, \"the courage to look for answers in places that we have never looked before and to think in new ways.\"\nAnd he said these new discoveries remind us that here in America, anything is possible if we have the courage and wisdom to lead. (Applause.)\nNow for my part, it really is a joy for this lifelong NASA fan to be standing here at the Johnson Space Center -- on my birthday, no less. (Applause.)\nThis really is a special place. Think about it. For more than half a century, this center has guided America's astronauts in their exploration of the heavens.\nYou here have managed 211 of America's crewed missions into space -- every single one -- from Gemini Four in 1965, to the International Space Station at this very moment.\nHere, you've navigated the first members of the human family to the moon, brought the crew of Apollo 13 back home safe and sound. And even now, you walk America's astronauts through their work as they walk above us in space.\nYou know, I caught \"Space Fever\" as a little boy in a small town in southern Indiana. And some of the most cherished memories of my youth were our family gathered around that black-and-white television, watching the images of your predecessors expanding the horizons of human knowledge with American leadership and American courage.\nAs a member of Congress, I actually asked to serve on the Science committee, on the NASA subcommittee, Mr. Chairman. And I had the privilege, along with my wife, Karen, and our three children to attend many shuttle launches at the Kennedy Space Center.\nI have no doubt that my son, who is now a Marine Corps aviator himself, was actually inspired to put on the uniform and to get in the cockpit from that one day that we sat in the grandstands when he was 10 years old at the Kennedy Space Center and watched with awe as America's heroic astronauts hurled into the heavens.\nI remember I said at the time and have thought ever since that to see a launch, especially at night at Cape Canaveral, it's like seeing the Earth giving birth to a piece of the sun and sending it home. The courage of these men and women and all the astronauts who have gone before inspires me to this very day.\nAmericans marvel at our astronauts. Only 338 Americans have ever held the title of American astronaut. While their numbers may be few, their accomplishments have been legion. And the tales of our astronauts are a testament to the indomitable spirit of the United States of America.\nThe astronauts of NASA have expanded our horizons and our hopes and inspired not only the American people, but all the world, with their extraordinary courage and achievements.\nThe names of their missions adorn the mantle of American greatness -- Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, our Space Shuttles, from Atlantis to Enterprise, and more.\nAnd the names of our heroic astronauts have been carved into the hearts of every American -- John Glenn, Alan Shepard, the rest of Mercury Seven, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Mae Jemison and Sally Ride, and all the men and women who took our nation to new heights.\nBut it's not just the astronauts. As you 12 know already and you're going to learn a lot more in the days ahead, we couldn't go anywhere without the dedication of the more than 17,000 men and women of NASA and the extraordinary contractors who send you to the heavens and bring you home. (Applause.)\nAnd let me make a promise to all of them and to these courageous newly minted heroes on this stage. Our administration, this will be true: NASA will have the resources and supports you need to continue to make history, to push the boundaries of human knowledge and advance American leadership to the boundless frontier of space. (Applause.)\nUnder President Donald Trump, America will lead in space once again, and the world will marvel. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump, though, recognizes that America needs a coherent and cohesive approach to the last and greatest, frontier. That's why I'm especially excited to announce, after more than two decades from when it was disbanded, that soon, President Trump will relaunch the National Space Council, and it will be my great honor, as Vice President of the United States, to chair the new National Space Council in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\nAmerica needs a National Space Council once again. Twice before in our nation's history, our nation has had a federal body charged with advising the President on national policy and strategy for space. The first Space Council helped marshal America's \"energies and skills\" during the infancy of our nation's attempts to reach the stars. It was under the council's watch that America put a man -- the first man in outer space and put a man on the moon in less than a decade between.\nOur National Space Council will reenergize the pioneering spirit of America in space, and it will ensure that America never again loses our lead in space exploration, innovation, and technology.\nAs President Trump said in his inaugural address, we will continue to \"unlock the mysteries of space,\" but to do so, we must reorient our civilian space program toward deep space exploration and provide the capabilities for America to maintain a constant presence in low-Earth orbit and beyond.\nThe American spirit is as limitless as space itself. And by tapping the bottomless well of American innovation, through increased collaboration with commercial space industries, we can seize opportunities that will benefit our nation and our people for generations to come.\nHistory has been made in these halls, and today, we're making history once again. Behind me stand 12 men and women who have already soared to tremendous heights in their careers, the newest class of America's astronauts.\nYou 12 have already distinguished yourselves. As Administrator Lightfoot just mentioned, more than 18,300 people applied to be members of this 12-member class, smashing the previous record of 8,000 applicants which was set back in 1978.\nYou are the 12 who made it through. You have joined the elites. You are the best of us. You carry on your shoulders the hopes and dreams of the American people.\nAnd I would imagine that your families, many who are gathered here, feel an almost inexpressible pride -- for you have been chosen to become astronauts. Let's give these families another round of applause. (Applause.) There's an old saying that when you see a box turtle on a fence post, one thing you know for sure, he didn't get there on his own. (Laughter.) And I know for every one of you -- those that are gathered here and those that are looking on -- have been there to lift you up, to hold up your arms and bring you to this extraordinary moment in your life.\nIt's amazing to think what you all have accomplished so many millions of Americans have dreamed about. They have. And they'll keep dreaming about it in generations to come. It was a flight of fancy for a little boy in Columbus, Indiana. But for you, that flight became your future, that dream has become your destiny. And in the years to come, you will depart from this blue marble, and take your place among the roll of American legends who have broken past the bonds of Earth.\nNow their legacy falls to you, and you will follow in their contrails -- and chart a path into the unknown.\nAs American astronauts, you may yet return our nation to the moon. You may be the first to travel to Mars. You may have experiences that we can only imagine, those of us who walk on terra firma.\nBut as you go forward, be assured: The American people stand with you. And the countless men and women behind the scenes who will carry you into space -- we stand with you, as well.\nAnd make no mistake about it. I know the path you have chosen is hard. But as President John F. Kennedy said not far from right here back in 1962, we know you choose to do these things not \"because they are easy,\" but rather, in his words, \"because they are hard.\" Because that challenge is one that you're willing to accept, unwilling to postpone. And that's a challenge, as President Kennedy said, \"one which we intend to win.\"\nAnd let me say to these astronauts and all that are gathered here: We will win.\nUnder the leadership of President Donald Trump, the United States will usher in a new era of space exploration that will benefit every facet of our national life. It will strengthen our national security and the safety of the American people. It will strengthen our economy, as we unlock new opportunities and new sources of prosperity. It will strengthen education in inspiring a rising generation of Americans to study science, technology, engineering, and math.\nAnd more than anything else, as the President believes with deep conviction, we'll strengthen the American spirit -- as once again, we reach out our hands to touch the heavens and raise our heads to gaze with wonder at the stars and the heroes that have the courage to explore them.\nYou 12 will be part of our vanguard. You're the heroes, you're the patriots, the trailblazers in the best American tradition. And I know you're humbled to be among that group.\nTo the 12 members of this new class of American astronauts, I say congratulations. You've already captured the respect and admiration of your peers, and when you lift off the launch pad, to boldly go, you'll capture the imagination of your nation and the world. And I believe with all of my heart, that when you go, you will not go alone.\nFor as the Psalmist teaches us, if you rise on the wings of the dawn, if you go up to the heavens, even there His hand will guide you, and His right hand will hold you fast.\nAs you begin this journey, know that you will be carried by grace and by the prayers of the American people.\nSo, Godspeed to the Class of 2017. May God guide you and bless you. May God bless NASA and may God bless the United States of America.

She wasn't allowed under the rules and regulations unless she paid an additional $50,000 in out-of-pocket expenses for the birth of her precious little girl—just born—Colette. Their monthly premiums have quadrupled. Their deductible is a staggering $15,000—meaning they won't even get to use it—and hopefully, I have to say that—but they won't get to use what they're paying so much for.\nDan Withrow's story is just as bad. He owns CSS Distribution Group, a small business in Louisville, Kentucky—fantastic State, great people. Before Obamacare, his 11 employees enjoyed multiple options for high quality, affordable health care. Everybody was happy. Is that right?\nCSS Distribution Group Inc. President and Cofounder Dan Withrow. Absolutely.\nThe President. Everybody was happy. Then came Obamacare, and now they have fewer choices. Premiums are 150 percent higher. It's amazing. But don't—you're not alone, by the way.\nMr. Withrow. I know.\nThe President. I see in Alaska it just went up over 200 percent. Alaska, over 200 percent, just announced. And creating new jobs is no longer really an option for Dan because the health insurance is so expensive.\nRaya and Dan are just two of the many victims of the Obamacare catastrophe created by congressional Democrats. Across America, premiums are skyrocketing, insurers are fleeing, and the American people are paying much more for much worse coverage. The coverage is horrendous. It's horrendous.\nSince the law's provision took effect, premiums have exploded by an average of 86 percent in Ohio and 75 percent in Kentucky. And those States are minor compared to others. The numbers in some of the States are much, much higher. Just yesterday we learned that one of the largest insurers is pulling out of Ohio. That could mean another 20,000 [20; White House correction.] counties, and 19,000 people will have no plan available to them.\nIn Kentucky, seven carriers have exited the State since Obamacare was implemented. I've been saying this for a long time. As a result, nearly half of the counties in Kentucky had only one choice in 2017. And if trends continue—and I think they definitely will. We don't have to think; they will continue—but we will come and we will do something great. We're in the process of doing it.\nBut if trends do continue, they'll have no plans in Kentucky in 2018. So 93,650 families—think of that—93,650 families paid $16.5 million in penalties instead of purchasing unaffordable Obamacare health plans that didn't meet their needs. Obamacare is in a total death spiral, and the problems will only get worse if Congress fails to act. Obamacare is dead. I've been saying it for a long time. Everybody knows it. Everybody that wants to report fairly about it knows.\nThe House of Representatives has done its job. It sent a plan to the Senate, and the Senate is working it over. We spent a lot of time yesterday with Mitch McConnell and a lot of the great Senators. They happen to be Republicans because we're having no help—it's only obstruction—from the Democrats. The Democrats are destroying health care in this country. We have had no help. We will get no votes no matter what we do. If we gave you the greatest plan in the history of the world, you would have no Democratic vote. It's all going to be Republicans or bust. And the Republicans are working very, very hard on getting a great healthcare plan.\nSo now it's the Senate's turn to act. And again, I hope that they're going to act in a very positive manner. I can tell you the Republican Senators are trying very hard. The Democrats are really in our way.\nWe want millions of Americans, like Raya and Dan, to finally have the quality and affordable health care that they deserve. They've been unfairly penalized for too long a period of time. We're working very hard to fix this big problem.\nI want to thank you very much. And to these two great families, I want thank you very much. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-06-07", "title": "Remarks on Health Care Reform in Cincinnati, Ohio"}

Well, thank you all very much. It is great to be back in Ohio. We love Ohio. You remember Ohio. Oh, boy. [Laughter] It was supposed to be close; it wasn't close. [Laughter] And so wonderful to speak on the shores of the very magnificent Ohio River.\nWe're here today to talk about rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure. Isn't it about time?\nAudience members. Yes.\nThe President. Spending money all over the world except here. We don't spend our money here. We spend it all over. And we will do it using American labor, American energy, American iron, aluminum, and steel. We believe in the dignity of work and in the greatness of the American worker. No worker like our American worker.\nI want to thank Secretary Perdue, Secretary Zinke, and Administrator Pruitt for joining us today. And you saw what we did with our great Administrator. You saw what happened last week with the so-called Paris accord. We will keep our Nation so great and so strong, and we will never have outside forces telling us what to do and how to do it, believe me. That would have been a huge anchor on our country.\nI'm also grateful that Governor Matt Bevin, his wife Glenna, and his family could be here, along with Lieutenant Governor Jenean Hampton—from Kentucky—great place. Where is Jenean? And Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor from Ohio. Thank you, Mary. Thank you very much.\nWe're also very excited to be joined by top labor leaders in the United States. I've negotiated with these people for so long. They're tough, but they get the job done. Right? Right? Together, we're going to put our skilled tradespeople back to work.\nSean McGarvey is here with us today, president of the North American Building Trades Union. Sean took part in one of our very first meetings at the White House—that was a great meeting, Sean—and was there with us when we issued the long-awaited approval for the Keystone XL Pipeline, which has started. After years and years of stagnation—they had said that's never going to happen—we got it started. It's going to happen, and it's about 48,000 jobs. It's a big job. And that's just the beginning. We have many other things happening, including, as you know, the Dakota Pipeline, also moving along very rapidly.\nWe will also welcome Eric Dean, president of the United Ironworkers, and Terry O'Sullivan of the Laborers' International Union of North America. I will proudly say to you all today what I told you and told our labor unions 2 months ago in Washington: As long as I am President, America's labor leaders will always find an open door at the White House. We had a great day. We love our workers.\nWe're also pleased to be joined by executives from Marathon Petroleum, Bunjee North America, CF Industries, Peabody Energy, Alliance Coal, AK Steel, Nucor Steel, Scotts—oh, you like that company, I guess. [Laughter] Scotts Miracle-Gro, and many others who are ready to help us build the roads, the bridges, the tunnels, and the waterways of tomorrow. And they're currently working very hard. In fact, I brought a couple of the greatest builders in America: Steve Roth of Vornado, Richard LeFrak of LeFrak. Where are you guys? Come here, come here, come here. Come up here, Steve. These people aren't used to this. They like to build. They don't know about this. Get up here, Richard. Two of the great builders if this—of our country. Come here, Richard. I'll watch—oh, I have to do this. Do you want to say anything, fellas?\nLeFrak Organization Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard LeFrak. Yes, I'll say something. I'll say——\nThe President. They're not big talkers. Unless they're behind a desk, they're big talkers. Go ahead, Richard. Go.\nMr. LeFrak. We're all fortunate the have the greatest builder in America, Donald J. Trump, standing behind an infrastructure program, which America sorely needs and is ready to implement. Donald, President Trump, thank you. Thank you very much.\nThe President. Thank you.\nSteve, come. Say—huh? No? Come here. All right. Get off the stage, fellas. [Laughter] That's it. Richard, that was a good job. [Laughter] Thank you. These are great builders. And we're watching, and they're looking over our shoulders. Believe me, they don't need the money. They're not doing it for that. I said, make sure it's going to come in on time, under budget—maybe even ahead of schedule—but we say, on time, under budget. And they're going to be watching and looking over some of the big jobs that we have planned so it gets done properly. Not these jobs that take 14 years to build when they're supposed to be completed in 18 months. You've been hearing about them a little bit, right? That's been the standard. It won't be happening, not in this administration.\nThe American people deserve the best infrastructure anywhere in the world. We are a nation that created the Panama Canal, the transcontinental railroad, and the Interstate—right? If you think about this—the great highway system, the Interstate Highway System—we don't do that anymore. We really don't. We don't even fix the old highways anymore. We'll take even fixing them, but we're going to get them going again like they've never been before.\nThese projects not only opened new lanes of commerce, but inspired the immigration and the dreams of millions and millions of people. We crafted monuments to the American spirit. It's time to recapture our legacy as a nation of builders and to create new lanes of travel, commerce, and discovery. And we're going to see all the way into the future, and the future is going to be beautiful, and the future is going to be bright.\nIn my campaign for President, I traveled all across the Nation. I saw the crumbling infrastructure. I met with communities that were desperate for new roads and new bridges. Bridges were so dangerous, they couldn't use them. They were worried they'd fall down. And you've seen that happen. And I heard the pleas from the voters who wanted to know why we could rebuild foreign countries—my big thing, we build in foreign countries, we spend trillions and trillions of dollars outside of our Nation—but we can't build a road, a highway, a tunnel, a bridge in our own Nation. And we watch everything falling into disrepair.\nIt's time to rebuild our country, to bring back our jobs, to restore our dreams, and yes, it's time finally to put America first. And that's what I've been doing if you haven't noticed. While it's very early in the administration, I think everyone has noticed, right?\nAudience member. We noticed. The President. We have noticed. The people are noticing like they've never noticed before. We're already making historic progress.\nLast month, unemployment fell to its lowest point in 16 years. Thank you. Right now—[applause]. Thank you. Right now more small businesses are planning to hire than at any point in the last decade. Last week, the stock market soared to record highs—highest ever—boosting the pensions—and your pensions and your retirement accounts and those of hard-working Americans.\nI've just returned from a trip overseas that secured more than $350 billion of military and economic investments into the United States. That means millions of jobs. And I want to thank the King of Saudi Arabia, King Salman—spent a lot of time together—and they're doing a great job. They're going to be doing something very special. You see it with terrorism, the funding of terrorism—it's going to stop. Got to stop the funding of radical Islamic terrorism, and they're going to stop.\nAnd they hosted over 50 all-Muslim countries. They said there's never been anything like in our history. In the history of this world, there has never been anything like what took place 2 weeks ago in Saudi Arabia, and I'm very proud to be a part of it. And hopefully, that can be the beginning of the end to this horrible, horrible situation that the world is suffering right now called terrorism. We're going to put an end to it. And we have to be very tough, and we have to be very smart, and we have to be very vigilant. And we're going to end it.\nIn my meetings with foreign leaders from many countries, I sent a clear message that America expects fair trade, a level playing field, and so many other things that we're demanding for our workers and for our companies. Every other country looks out for their interests. It's time that we finally start looking out for our interests in the United States. No longer will we sacrifice American jobs, factories, and wealth. The theft of American prosperity has come to a screeching halt, folks. And a new era of American greatness is about to begin. And you see it. It's already beginning.\nWe're going to restore America's industrial might. And I look here and something—those barges, they've been waiting for us to say hello. The captain says, please wave. Hello, Captain. [Laughter] He put up that big, beautiful American flag.\nCreating the jobs and tax base to put new infrastructure all over our country, it's what's happening. But to achieve our full economic strength we must repeal and replace Obamacare. Since Obamacare's implementation began, premiums have increased by an average of 75 percent in Kentucky and 86 percent in Ohio. Just yesterday we learned that the last statewide insurer in Ohio is leaving. Have you folks heard about that? That's it. Bye-bye. Wave goodbye. What a mess! That could mean another 20 counties and 19,000 people will have no plans.\nThe House of Representative has done—and the House of Representatives has been working, I will tell you very, very hard—has done its job in passing along an Obamacare replacement bill. Now it's time for the Senate—Mitch McConnell, he's working very hard—to act and to save Americans from this catastrophic event. Because Obamacare is dead. Obamacare was one of the biggest broken promises in the history of politics. Remember you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan? Didn't work out that way. You end up paying not to have insurance because it was cheaper.\nBut there's another major promise that Washington has repeatedly broken, and that is the one where we are here today. It's a promise that's gone unheeded, and it's called restoring America, restoring our country: the promise of a safe, reliable, and modern infrastructure. It hasn't been kept, but we're going to keep it.\nAmerican lives and livelihoods depend on our action, together. That's why I am calling on all Democrats—who, honestly, have really been obstructionists. Boy, have they tried—I mean, every single thing. On health care, I won't get one vote. Obamacare is crashing. It's dead. It's in a \"death spiral,\" as the head of one of the biggest insurance companies said. It's in a death spiral. And we're coming out to do good. Not to do bad, to do good. And we won't get one Democrat vote. Think of it. They're just obstructionists. Every single thing is obstruction.\nI don't think—you know, honestly, if I were in that party, I wouldn't be doing it that way. I'd be doing positive things. That's why they lost the House, they lost the Senate, they lost the White House. People don't want to see what's going on. They want to see us all come together. But I just don't see them coming together. They're obstructionists.\nI'm calling on all Democrats and Republicans to join together, if that's possible, in the great rebuilding of America. Countless American industries, businesses, and jobs depend on rivers, runways, roads, and rails that are in dire and even desperate condition. And millions of American families rely on their water and pipes and pumps that are on the verge of total failure and collapse.\nWe are pleased to be joined today by representatives from many, many industries that depend on a truly critical component of our Nation's infrastructure, the 12,000 miles of inland waterways. We have farmers, coal miners—and by the way, those coal miners are happy. Coal miners, oh, they like Trump. [Applause] They like Trump. Same with steelworkers, and oil workers. We've taking those restrictions and those horrible regulations off your companies. We're going to have clean, beautiful air; clean, beautiful, crystal water. But you're going to have your jobs also. You're going to have your jobs. Maybe more than ever before.\nSo I want to salute each of you for the work that you've done and, maybe more importantly, for the work that you're about to do. Because it's going to be a beautiful thing, you watch. These citizens know firsthand that the rivers, like the beautiful Ohio River, carry the lifeblood of our heartland. In fact, I'm very proud that behind us today are those 12 barges.\nOh, look at this. West Virginia—do we love West Virginia? West Virginia—they're filled with West Virginia coal. And you know, next week, we're opening a big coal mine—you know about that—one in Pennsylvania. It's actually a new mine. That hadn't happened in a long time, folks. But we're putting the people and we're putting the miners back to work.\nThe contents of just one nine-barge towboat, like the one behind me, carries the equivalent of 1,000 semi-tractor trailers. People don't realize it. People don't realize it. But they do now. Roughly 60 percent of United States grain exports travel down these waterways to the Gulf. More than half of all the American steel is produced within 250 miles of where we're standing right now, and its production depends on the inland waterway system.\nAnd wait till you see what I'm going to do for steel and for your steel companies. We're going to stop the dumping and stop all of these wonderful other countries from coming in and killing our companies and our workers. You'll be seeing that very soon. The steel folks are going to be very happy.\nUp to 25 percent of the Nation's energy cargo relies on these channels and the refineries along their shores. But these critical corridors of commerce depend on a dilapidated system of locks and dams that is more than half a century old, and their condition, as you know better than anybody, is in very, very bad shape. It continues to decay.\nCapital improvements of this system, which is so important, have been massively underfunded, and there is an $8.7 billion maintenance backlog that is only getting bigger and getting worse. Last December, up the Ohio River near Pittsburgh, one lock built more than 50 years ago had to be shut down for 5 days due to hydraulic failure. And you know what that means. Five days means everything comes to a halt. We simply cannot tolerate a 5-day shutdown on a major thoroughfare for American coal, American oil, and American steel, which is going to get more and bigger. America must have the best, fastest, and most reliable infrastructure anywhere in the world. We cannot accept these conditions any longer.\nA few years ago, a gate broke from its hinges at the Markland Locks on the Ohio River in Kentucky. It took nearly 5 months to repair. Any of you know about that? Wasn't a pretty picture, right? Right? I don't think so. And in 2011, a massive section of canal wall collapsed near Chicago, delaying everything, and it seemed like forever.\nGreat American businesses, like Land O'Lakes, which is here today from Minnesota—where are they? Stand up. That's good stuff. Where—come on, stand up. [Applause] Good. It's good stuff—fear that the lock and dam systems they rely on are no longer dependable. I am here with a message for you and for all of the great businesses that are gathered with us, and maybe more importantly—because that's what it's ultimately about—those businesses' workers: Together, we will fix it. We will create the first-class infrastructure our country and our people deserve.\nMy new vision for American infrastructure will rebuild our country by generating $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. Our infrastructure program—[applause]—it's a lot, a trillion.\nYou know, as of a few months ago, we spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, along with the death of so many incredible people, and along with all of the other problems that you've been watching every night on television and reading about in the papers—$6 trillion. And yet if we want to fix a road or we want to fix a school or we want to make sure that a bridge doesn't collapse in our country—forgetting about even building new ones—we don't ever seem to have the money. Got to change, folks. It's got to change. Something wrong. Something wrong.\nOur infrastructure program will be based on forging new partnerships and demanding new accountability for every Federal taxpayer dollar. Under this vision, the Federal Government will drastically reduce burdensome regulations, which we've already been doing. We have some more to go, but it's going rapidly. I think when people tell me, you know, we're doing the largest tax cut in history, people are more impressed with the fact that we've cut so many regulations, if they had their choice, which is hard to believe. Nobody would have believed it.\nSo we're getting rid of the regulations, and we're massively streamlining the approvals and the permitting process. Already, my administration has expedited environmental reviews and critical energy projects all across the country. They're getting approved so fast. Thousands and thousands of big jobs—big, big jobs. I don't mean individual jobs, I'm talking about project-type jobs. Thousands of them are being approved rapidly.\nAnd if they're not environmentally sound, they're not going to be approved. But we'll tell them, you're not going to get approved. But thousands of jobs are being approved all over the United States, and I'm very proud of it. And Scott Pruitt has been right at the forefront, and he's done an amazing job. And it hasn't been that easy for him, has it, Scott? But he likes it. He likes to see people go back to work. And he likes to make sure that the environment is perfect and clean. I want to add that too.\nI'm pleased to announce that the Dakota Access Pipeline, which I just mentioned, is now officially open for business, a $3.8 billion investment in American infrastructure that was stalled, and nobody thought any politician would have the guts to approve that final leg. And I just closed my eyes and said, do it. [Laughter]\nThink of it through a company's standpoint. They build this massive pipeline, going for miles, then they have to hook it up, a little section. And they're stopped. And I said, that's not fair. And you know, when I approved it—it's up, it's running. It's beautiful. It's great. Everybody is happy. The Sun is still shining. The water is clean. [Laughter] But you know when I approved it, I thought I'd take a lot of heat. And I took none. Actually none. People respected that I approved it. But I take so much heat for nonsense that it probably overrode—[laughter]—it probably overrode the other. It's like a decoy. [Laughter]\nAmerica built the Golden Gate Bridge in just 4 years and the Hoover Dam in 5 years. Think of that. It should not take 10 years to get approvals for a very small, little piece of infrastructure. And it won't, because under my administration, it's not going to happen like that anymore.\nWe will work directly with State and local governments to give them the freedom and flexibility they need to revitalize our Nation's infrastructure. At least $200 billion of the $1 trillion plan will come from direct Federal investment. Working with States, local governments, and private industry, we will ensure that these new Federal funds are matched by significant additional dollars for maximum efficiency and accountability. We'll have people watching over each one of these jobs, and every penny will count to them. Taxpayers deserve the best results for their investment, and I will ensure that this is what they get.\nThe last administration passed a stimulus package of which only a tiny 7 percent went to infrastructure, and much of that was just wasted money. You folks up front, you know what I'm talking about. The great infrastructure plan, nobody saw any money. Remember \"shovel ready,\" right? Shovel ready wasn't shovel ready. [Laughter] That I can tell you. We're not going to repeat that mistake. That's not going to happen again.\nInstead, our plan will help States and local governments prioritize their most pressing infrastructure needs, building transformative projects that create a flood of wealth and opportunity to benefit every part of our country, especially rural America. The companies here today are prepared to work with us—and these are great companies today—and you're going to work with us to make sure the right infrastructure gets built and funded quickly, and it's going to be in the right location. Everything about it is going to be right. Businesses like these are ready to invest and creating jobs, but have been waiting for a responsible partner in the Federal Government. You've been waiting for a long time. Now, you have one.\nSo I want to thank all of the great workers for being here today. I want to thank all of the great business leaders. You have some business leaders that are legendary people in the audience, running massive, massive companies, and being slowed down, but now they'll be able to speed it up. Not only are we going to repair much of the depleted infrastructure, but we're going to create brand new projects that excite and inspire, because that is what a great country does. That is what a great country has to do. America wants to build. Across the Nation, our amazing construction workers, steelworkers, ironworkers, fitters, electricians, and so many others are just waiting to get back to work. With the talent and skill they represent—which, believe me, I grew up in the building business, I know the talent and the skill and the courage and everything else that they have—there is no limit to what we can achieve. All it takes is a bold and daring vision and the will to make it happen.\nNearly two centuries ago, one American Governor had just such a vision and a will. His name was Governor Dewitt Clinton. As the Governor of New York State, he dreamed of a canal stretching nearly 400 miles, to connect the Atlantic Ocean in the East with the Great Lakes in the West. He predicted that its construction would place New York City at the very center of worldwide commerce.\nHe took the idea to Washington, but President Thomas Jefferson—great President—didn't agree with him, and he dismissed that concept as total \"madness.\" I'd like to thank—and all of the people that helped so much in that incredible event, and I think that Jefferson simply understood who he was and who he was dealing with—because if you want a New Yorker to do something, just tell them—like our great past Governor—that it's impossible to do.\nThe Governor didn't give up, and New York State achieved what they thought was the impossible. And when the Erie Canal opened in 1825, he was on the first boat. He personally deposited a bucket of water from the Great Lakes into the New York Harbor.\nThe new canal exceeded even the Governor's bold vision. It dramatically reduced the time and cost required to transport goods from the heartland. As a result, new settlers rushed into the Midwest, including to right, smack, here. Probably some of you indirectly, right? Definitely some of you.\nJust as the daring dreams of our ancestors opened new paths across our land, today, we will build the dreams that open new paths to a better tomorrow. We, too, will see jobs and wealth flood into the heartland and see new products and new produce made and grown right here in the U.S.A. And you don't hear that much anymore. We will buy American, and we will hire American.\nWe will not—so importantly—be content to let our Nation become a museum of former glories. We will construct incredible new monuments to American grit that inspire wonder for generations and generations to come. We will build because our people want to build and because we need them to build. We will build because our prosperity demands it. And above all, we will build because that is how we make America great again.\nThank you. God bless you. Go out there and work. You're going to see some amazing things happen over the next long period of time. Thank you, everyone. It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-06-07", "title": "Remarks in Cincinnati, Ohio"}
{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126304", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. Thanks so much for that wonderfully warm welcome. And on behalf of the First Family, welcome to the White House -- and welcome to a new era for American infrastructure in the United States. (Applause.)\nIt's a great privilege to be among so many friends and this distinguished group of American leaders. And this White House infrastructure commitment is being unpacked all this week. We're actually calling it Infrastructure Week in this administration, and today I have the honor to kick off our very first summit focused on infrastructure. And we're so grateful that you all are here.\nBut I know I'm not the main attraction today. And you know, the American people, if you haven't noticed it yet, did elect a builder to be President of the United States of America. And in just a few hours, you're going to hear firsthand from the 45th President of the United States of America. President Donald Trump is committed to rebuilding America. (Applause.)\nAnd I bring greetings from the President. This afternoon, I know he's looking very much forward to being with you all. It's been inspiring to see the President's leadership on this issue -- especially during this Infrastructure Week.\nJust yesterday in Cincinnati, the President declared, in his words, that the \"American people deserve the best infrastructure anywhere in the world,\" and he laid out his vision to Buy American and Hire American as we rebuild our country and make America great again.\nIt's a sign of this President's commitment that he also sent me and so many members of the administration here to this summit.\nToday, I'm so pleased to be joined by several key members of the administration who will be working very closely with all of you as we move forward this agenda in the Congress and across the country. We've got Secretary Elaine Chao, our Secretary of Transportation is with us today. (Applause.) And we've got the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney is with us today. (Applause.) These are two extraordinary leaders who are looking forward to being full partners with the state governments that are represented here and the local governments that are represented here as we rebuild America.\nAfter lunch, you'll hear from more of the team -- Secretary Sonny Perdue, Secretary Wilbur Ross, and Secretary Ryan Zinke. I got to tell you, folks, this is the A-Team. And I'm incredibly proud to be a small part of it.\nIt's a great privilege to be joined by so many public servants from across America -- Republican and Democrat. This room, and the history of this room, all stand for the principle that rebuilding America is a bipartisan enterprise. And we will make it so in this administration. (Applause.)\nI served as a governor myself, back in the great state of Indiana, and I'm particularly glad to see not only my successor here, but eight of America's governors here -- especially if you'll allow me some parochialism, the great Governor of Indiana, Eric Holcomb, is with us. (Applause.) And it's great to be joined by no fewer than eleven mayors, five county commissioners, two tribal leaders, and two agriculture commissioners. Let's give all of these great public officials a rousing round of applause for coming to the White House to champion their states and communities. (Applause.)\nThe President and I wanted you here because the truth is that no one knows infrastructure better than those of you that are gathered here, and other men and women around the country who hold similar positions. In my time as Governor of Indiana, I saw firsthand just how important it is to have world-class infrastructure in our states and in our cities.\nIt's about working families trying to get their kids to school safely and efficiently. It's about small businesses and family farms trying to get their goods to the market. It's about ending wait times at airports and train stations so commuters can get to work and lead more productive lives. It's about opening the floodgates for affordable American energy -- the lifeblood of American growth. And it's about what President Trump said yesterday: \"Bring[ing] back our jobs…restor[ing] our dreams…\" and putting America first, with the best infrastructure in the world. (Applause.)\nThis President knows that good infrastructure means good jobs, growth, opportunity, and prosperity. But as all of you well know, our nation's infrastructure is in a truly sorry state. The President was right yesterday when he said, in his words, \"Countless American industries, businesses, and jobs depend on rivers, runways, roads, and rails\" look out and see infrastructure that's in \"dire and even desperate conditions\" in many cases.\nAnd for your part, you see it when you drive to work, you hear about it from the people who elected you. The truth is that our roads, bridges, and airports are crumbling in too many cases. And America, as a result, has been falling behind.\nAt this very moment, America only has the 12th best infrastructure in the world. Think about that for a second. The most powerful economy on Earth by a lot has the 12th-rated infrastructure on the planet. We're miles behind countries like Japan and Germany, just to name a few.\nSo let me be clear: For this administration, for this President, that's not just unacceptable -- that's down-right un-American, and it's going to change. (Applause.) And the truth is that, in times past, the world stood in awe and envy of America's infrastructure, didn't they? Not the other way around.\nAmerica built the Erie Canal and the Golden Gate Bridge. America built the Transcontinental Railroad and the Interstate Highway System. Americans have always built the monuments to progress that inspire and endure. And under the leadership of President Donald Trump, America is going to build like never before.\nWorking with the Congress, working with American businesses, and working with all of you in direct partnership with our state and local governments, the President is committed to making historic investments in our national infrastructure so that America has the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways, the best waterways, and the best airports we have ever had in the history of this country. (Applause.)\nThe President has already taken decisive action to rebuild America. After years of politics and pointless delays under previous administrations, President Donald Trump, early in our administration, quickly green-lighted the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines, opening up pathways for American energy and growth. (Applause.)\nThe President has signed more bills rolling back regulatory red tape standing in the way of growth than any President in American history. And the President has actually ordered a top-to-bottom review of federal permitting, because I can say to these governors, under this administration bureaucrats are no longer going to be a barrier to rebuilding America. (Applause.)\nAnd, folks, it's already been a banner week for infrastructure. Yesterday, in Cincinnati, President Trump highlighted the tremendous problems facing our inland waterways -- the arteries of commerce across the American heartland that I know so well.\nAnd on Monday, the President unveiled his plan to bring a new vision, and new partners from the private and public sector, to finally fix America's air traffic control system so that air travel in this country can be cheaper, faster, and safer for the American people and for American commerce. (Applause.)\nAnd that's just the beginning. Our administration is working to craft a truly historic infrastructure package. And it's going to be big. The truth is that every dollar we invest in American infrastructure is a dollar we invest in America's future.\nAnd as you saw in President Trump's first budget, in partnership with the private economy and our states and cities, our commitment is that we are going to invest a trillion dollars in America's roads and bridges and America's future. (Applause.)\nAnd unlike for our administration, we're not just going to put up signs on the road saying we're \"shovel ready.\" (Laughter.) Under this President, we'll actually put shovels in the ground and work with our state and local governments to get the job done.\nUnder President Trump's leadership, we're going to fundamentally change also how we build infrastructure in America. President Trump laid out his vision for infrastructure yesterday in Cincinnati. We're going to put renewed focus on rural communities, and we're going to do all that we can each and every day to open arteries of opportunity for the forgotten men and women of America. (Applause.)\nWe're going to restore accountability to infrastructure and forge new partnerships with your states and your cities, but also with businesses, to leverage private sector expertise and tap into the bottomless well of American innovation. We'll revolutionize federal permitting and review with the goal of reducing wait times from ten years to two years. (Applause.)\nAnd for all the governors and mayors who are here today, rest assured we're going to work directly with you and give you the freedom and flexibility to move forward with your projects on your timelines. The vast majority of American infrastructure is owned by state and local governments, and Washington, D.C. has no place calling the shots.\nWhen I was Governor, I wanted an administration in Washington that would listen to me, not lecture me; that would help me build up my state, including our infrastructure, and not put roadblocks in the way of progress for our people.\nAnd rest assured to all of you who have longed for that as long as I have: You've got a President on your side, and we're going to fight to give our states the resources and the flexibility to build infrastructure of the future so your state can grow. (Applause.)\nSo to all the governors and mayors and public servants here today: We're listening. We're looking forward to working with each and every one of you. And today, I hope you'll just see as a small down payment on what we expect to be a renewed and vibrant relationship that our administration will form with you as we work together to rebuild America.\nAnd perhaps most important of all, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, America will once again turn our attention to truly transformational projects -- the ones that enrich the American spirit and ensure a brighter American future. We know it can be done because we've done it before. All throughout our history there have been those moments where American ingenuity and creativity and that extraordinary American work ethic has shown forth.\nIt was exactly 86 years ago last month, in the midst of the Great Depression, that American workers broke ground on a project unlike anything our nation had ever built. America had a vision to bring irrigation and electricity to vast swaths of the American Southwest, to make the desert bloom with crops and hum with industry. This required something not just new, but, frankly, revolutionary. No structure of its kind had ever built -- in size had ever been built. And the feats of engineering necessary to complete it had only been written down on paper and theorized; it had never been tested.\nMany said it was impossible. But America, as usual, proved them wrong -- and we did the impossible. Our people rose to the challenge and completed their work in just five years, ahead of schedule and under budget. And when the waters of the Colorado River poured forth from the Hoover Dam, the world looked on with wonder at what America had done. (Applause.)\nThe President sees our duty today is simply to recapture that same spirit -- that spirit that had the world stand in awe of what Americans do and what we build. And we'll be there again. We'll demonstrate to the world again as we reach for a brighter future, as we build an infrastructure that every American can be proud of in every community large and small; that we once again can marvel the world with our innovation and our investment and our creativity and our people.\nBut we've got our work cut out for us. The infrastructure challenges of today and tomorrow are larger than any we've ever faced in the modern era. But I promise you, we're up to the task, and we know you are as well. President Trump has the vision, and the American people have the ingenuity and the indomitable will to make it happen.\nWe have an opportunity and an obligation to accomplish great things in our time -- to rebuild our streets, to renew our cities, to usher in a new era of opportunity for the American people and our posterity. And this we know we'll do.\nIn partnership with each one of you, the discussions that we have today are just a beginning. And with the leadership of President Donald Trump, I have every confidence that we will rebuild America, we will make America prosperous again, we will make our roads and highways more safe again. In a word, to borrow a phrase, we'll Make America Great Again. (Applause.)\nThanks, everybody. Thank you for coming. God bless you, and God bless the United States.", "timestamp": "2017-06-08", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at the Infrastructure Summit Working Luncheon"}

After the GOP took the House and tried to cut spending for liberal interest groups, the Obama Justice Department began to force corporate defendants to allocate a chunk of their financial penalties to those same groups.\nBanks were made to fund left-wing activists such as NeighborWorks—though these groups were neither victims nor parties to lawsuits. In 2015 JP Morgan was required to pay $7.5 million to the American Bankruptcy Institute's endowment for financial education. In 2016 Volkswagen was required to invest $2 billion in zero-emissions technology and promote zero-emissions cars. Government enforcement became an income redistribution mechanism without having to go through Congress.\nMr. Sessions's brief memo instructs Justice's 94 U.S. Attorneys to immediately halt the practice. It correctly notes that financial penalties are designed to punish and provide relief to victims—not to generate political payola. Save for limited exceptions—such as payments expressly authorized by statute—the memo instructs that future settlement money will go directly to victims or to the U.S. Treasury.\nRead the full editorial here.", "timestamp": "2017-06-08", "title": "Press Release - Wall Street Journal Editorial Board: \"The Death Of Obama’s Slush Funds\""}

He also referred to H.R. 1628; and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126534", "text": "The President. Thank you, Ralph. He said we got 81 percent of the vote. I want to know, who are the 19 percent? Who are they? [Laughter] Where do they come from? [Laughter]\nThank you, Ralph, for that really kind introduction and for your great leadership. It's wonderful to be back here with all of my friends. It is the fifth time. Who would have known this was going to happen? [Laughter] But we had a feeling, didn't we?\nAnd, Ralph, I want to congratulate you and your wife Jo Anne and each and every person in the audience today. In just a few years, you've helped turn a small organization into a really nationwide, beautiful movement. True, so true. And what you have achieved is extraordinary. I've spoken to this group so much, so often—I'll be back—most recently, 1 year ago this week, when I came here to ask for your support, your help, and your prayers. And wow, did you deliver.\nYou really did. Last year, you knocked on more than 1.2 million doors in the key battleground States where, as you remember, we focused. Supposed to be focusing on those States. You sent 22 million pieces of mail, shared 16 million videos, and made 10 million phone calls. That's something.\nAnd I'm honored by your incredible support and grateful for your commitment to our shared cause. Thank you for all that you do. Thank you very much. Thank you. You didn't let me down, and I will never, ever let you down. You know that.\nWe will always support our evangelical community and defend your right and the right of all Americans to follow and to live by the teachings of their faith. And as you know, we're under siege. You understand that. But we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever. You watch.\nYou fought hard for me, and now I'm fighting hard for all of you. I have one goal as President: to fight for the American people and to fight for America and America first.\nWe are going to battle for every American who has lost a job, for every family who has lost a loved one, for every American of faith who has lost their rights and lost their freedom. The forgotten men and women will never, ever be forgotten again. You know about that. Remember, they said, where did all these people come from? [Laughter] And you know what? They're still trying to figure it out. They don't get it. [Laughter] They don't get it.\nYour voices will resound across the halls of our Capitol and across the world. We recite today the words of Isaiah chapter 1, verse 17: \"Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow.\"\nThe entrenched interests and failed, bitter voices in Washington will do everything in their power to try and stop us from this righteous cause, to try to stop all of you. They will lie. They will obstruct. They will spread their hatred and their prejudice. But we will not back down from doing what is right. Because, as the Bible tells us: We know that the truth will prevail, that God's glorious wisdom will shine through, and that the good and decent people of this country will get the change they voted for and that they so richly deserve. Nothing worth doing ever came easy, but we know how to fight better than anybody. And we never, ever would give up, and we don't give up. We are winners, and we are going to fight and win and have an unbelievable future. Unbelievable future. And it's going to be together.\nWe are keeping the solemn promises that we made to the great citizens of our country. We are eliminating job-killing regulations, reversing Government overreach, and returning power back to everyday Americans, where the country started.\nIn just a short period of time, we've already added nearly 1 million new jobs and approved historic increases in military spending. We've achieved a record reduction in illegal immigration. Did you see at the southern border? Seventy-five percent. Seventy-five percent. If they do one percent in the past, it used to be, oh, we're doing so well. Seventy-five percent. General Kelly is doing a great job.\nAnd we are protecting our families, schools, and cities by removing the gang members—MS-13. MS-13. We're spreading them out—the drug dealers and criminals from our country—and cracking down on the sanctuary cities that protect them. And we believe that people who come to our country should love our citizens and embrace our values—our values, folks.\nIn my first 100 days—and I don't think anybody has ever done more or, certainly, not much more—I appointed and confirmed a Supreme Court Justice in the mold of the late, great Antonin Scalia. And now Justice Gorsuch has a seat on the United States Supreme Court. Made a promise.\nWe have also proposed a historic tax cut—biggest in the history of our country, by the way—and we are fighting for fair trade that creates a level playing field for all of our American companies and our American workers. We are not on a fair playing field, but it's getting fairer by the day. We are bringing back our jobs.\nTo protect those jobs and the sovereignty and freedom of the United States, I followed through on my promise to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. [Applause] Thank you. You understand it. You understand how bad it was for our country. It's going to strip us of our jobs, our wealth, our companies. And they keep saying, oh, it's nonbinding—so innocent. I figure between that deal, the Iran deal, NAFTA—we've got some beauties, don't we? [Laughter] Don't worry, you're going to see some real good ones coming about very soon. You're going to see some great ones coming about very soon.\nAmerica will continue to lead the world on environmental protection. We're going to have clean water, crystal clean. We're going to have clean air. But what we won't do is let other countries take advantage of the United States anymore and dictate what we are doing and dictate our future.\nFrom now on, we will follow a very simple rule: Every day I am President, we are going to make America first—not somebody else, not some other country. We are going to make America first. Thank you.\nAs I am sure you know, I have also reinstated the Mexico City policy first put into place by Ronald Reagan to protect the unborn. Thank you. Thank you.\nAnd in a really beautiful ceremony at the White House, on the National Day of Prayer, I signed, as I promised I would, a new executive action to protect religious liberty in America, including protecting the rights of groups like yours, the Little Sisters of the Poor. Thank you. Stand up. The Little Sisters of the Poor. They fought so hard for so many years. All of the sudden, they heard, \"We won.\" [Laughter] Right? They were doing—they were tough. Don't want to mess with the Little Sisters, right? [Laughter] They hung in, and they had a lot of losses. They sustained a lot of losses. But all of the sudden, one day, a few weeks ago, it was over. They won. So congratulations. Great toughness—great. Great people.\nThat Executive order also followed through on one of my campaign promises to so many of you: to stop the Johnson Amendment from interfering with your First Amendment rights. It was my promise. This Executive order directs the IRS not to unfairly target churches and religious organizations for political speech. So the people that you most respect can now feel free to speak to you, like my friends sitting right over here. I can now hear them, and they're unimpeded. So I just want to congratulate everybody in this room, because that was a big deal, and it was a very important thing for me to do for you. And we're not finished yet, believe me. We're not finished yet. So thank you very much.\nNo Federal worker should be censoring sermons or targeting pastors. These are the people we want to hear from. How about the people we do hear from every night on television? You want to hear from them? I don't think so.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. No, no, we want to hear from the people that we want to hear from.\nAs long as I'm President, no one is going to stop you from practicing your faith or from preaching what is in your heart and from preaching—and really, this is so important, from the bottom of my heart—from preaching from the people that you most want to hear, and that you so respect. So we have taken a very, very strong position, and you picked a winner.\nSo we want our pastors speaking out. We want their voices in our public discourse. And we want our children to know the blessings of God. Schools should not be a place that drive out faith and religion, but that should welcome faith and religion with wide, open, beautiful arms. Faith inspires us to be better, to be stronger, to be more caring and giving and more determined to act in selfless and courageous defense of what is good and what is right. It is time to put a stop to the attacks on religion. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nWe will end the discrimination against people of faith. Our Government will once again celebrate and protect religious freedom. Restoring freedom and opportunity also means repealing and replacing the disaster known as——\nAudience members. Obamacare!\nThe President. That was easy. [Laughter] Do you see how it's failing?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Okay. So I've been saying 116 percent for so long—it was Arizona that was. So yesterday I have a new number—204 percent, in Alaska, increase. It's a catastrophe. Obamacare, as one of the big insurance companies had said, is in a spiral. It's in a death spiral. It is dead. Dead. Some of the States are losing their insurance companies. Yesterday Ohio lost one of the big ones. And Ohio has got problems now. They all have problems: Kentucky, Tennessee, every place I go.\nBut we're dealing with obstructionists. The Democrats are obstructionists. You know what, it would be great to get along with them, but it seems to be impossible. They are obstructionists. And they have a health care plan that's a disaster, called Obamacare. Again, the insurance companies are fleeing, the premiums are through the roof. The deductibles—I mean, unless you die a long, horrible, slow death—[laughter]—those deductibles are so high—sadly, folks, you'll never get to use them. It is a disaster, what's going on with Obamacare. Nobody wants to talk about it. But you take a look at the premiums, how high; you take a look at those deductibles. You have nothing.\nAnd then, of course, the mandate. Let's pay to get out of it, okay? We're the only one—we pay to get out of not paying. That's how bad it is.\nSo Obamacare is dead. And don't let them pin it on the Republicans, by the way. We've only been here for a short period of time, okay? But a good bill passed in the House. Something, I hope, great is going to come out through Mitch McConnell and the Senate. And we're working very hard. I can tell you, we're really working hard.\nAnd if we had the best plan in the history of the world, we wouldn't get one Democrat vote. [Laughter] Just remember that. If we had a plan that gave you the greatest health care ever in history, you wouldn't get one Democrat vote because they're obstructionists. They're bad, right now, for the country. They've gone so far left that I don't know if they can ever come back.\nNow as a—believe it or not—politician—I never would call myself a politician, but I guess that's what I am. I became President; I guess I'm a politician. [Laughter] Selfishly, I love where they've gone, because I think they've taken the wrong path. But they have gone so far left, trying to appease a certain group, that I think they've made a horrible mistake.\nBut what they have done is, they've tried to obstruct. And that's why, when it comes to the elections in '18, we have to get more, because we only have—we're only up by two in the Senate and a pretty small number in the House. And we have to build those numbers up because we're just not going to get votes.\nNow, maybe times will change, and that could happen at some point. I remember when Republicans and Democrats would fight like hell, then they'd go out, have lunch together, have dinner together, go back, fight like hell, and get a lot of things done. Now the lunches and the dinners don't take place. The level of hatred is beyond anything that I've ever seen.\nSo they're obstructionists, but we're going to get health care done. We're going to get the tax cares done—the tax cuts. We have the biggest tax cut and great tax reform. We're going to get it done, but sadly, we're going to have to do it as Republicans because we won't get any Democrat votes. And that's a very, very sad, sad thing.\nI've filled my administration and Cabinet with people who share our priorities and who want to deliver for the American people. And even that, as you know, it's so hard—the process—because of the obstruction. It's so hard. You know, they say \"resist,\" but they really should say \"obstruct.\" [Laughter] But it's so hard because you put—when you hear that we have vacancies, it's true. But take a look at what's going on. Getting the simplest appointment is a big deal that takes forever.\nOur wonderful Vice President, Mike Pence, will be here later this week What a great guy he is. Great guy. When Dr. James Dobson—stand up, James; stand up, James. Good. Great man, great guy—thank you, James—receives a lifetime achievement award. But today I also want to congratulate Dr. Dobson and his wife, Shirley, who was with me at the beginning of the campaign—right at the beginning of the campaign. And I called back—but she was substituting for James because he was so busy preaching. And I said, you know what, James, she may be better than you are. She was good. [Laughter] She was good. We had a good time, right? And I'll tell you what, the audience—they loved her.\nSo in advance of that recognition, James, and for everything they've both done to keep the Focus on the Family, I just want to congratulate you. It's just so amazing. Thank you. Great. Great people. Great people. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Shirley. Thanks, James.\nFamily is the foundation of American life, and we are proud to stand together with all of you to promote and protect family values. We're here today to celebrate two values that have always been linked together, and where Ralph, frankly, has done such a great job in linking them: faith and freedom.\nThey're linked together because liberty comes from our Creator. Our rights are given to us by a divine authority, and no earthly force can ever take those rights away. That is why my administration is taking power out of Washington and giving it back to the people where it belongs. I said right from the beginning.\nFor too long, politicians have tried to centralize authority among the hands of a small few in our Nation's Capital. People are getting very rich. Bureaucrats think they can run over your lives, overrule your values, and tell you how to live.\nBut we know that families and churches, not Government officials, know best how to create a strong and loving community. We know that parents, not bureaucrats, know best how to raise children and create a thriving society. And above all else, we know this: In America, we don't worship government. We worship God. Right? We worship God. [Applause] Thank you.\nOur religious liberty is enshrined in the very First Amendment in the Bill of Rights. The American Founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Don't worry, we're not going to let them change it. [Laughter] You see what goes on nowadays, right?\nBenjamin Franklin reminded his colleagues at the Constitutional Convention to begin by bowing their heads in prayer. Inscribed on our currency are the words \"In God We Trust.\" And we proudly proclaim that we are \"one Nation, under God,\" every time we say the Pledge of Allegiance.\nYou just heard a brave 6-year-old patriot named Christian Jacobs beautifully recite that Pledge of Allegiance. I first met Christian last week, after the Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, where we honor and remember the American patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.\nChristian was in perfect Marine dress blues, as a tribute to his dad, his beautiful dad. And he walked right up to me, in a big crowd of people. And without hesitation, he asked if I would like to come see where his daddy is resting. Next, he led me over to where Marine Sergeant Christopher Jacobs lies among his brothers-and-sisters-in-arms, in Section 60, and showed me pictures of his fallen father who was so great and so important to him.\nNot only does young Christian carry those photos, but he carries his father's love in his heart and his courage in his beautiful, beaming young face. With his mom, Brittany, by his side—terrific mother—I said, is your mother good or is she great? He said, \"She's great.\" [Laughter] I said, you'd better say that. [Laughter] He looked me square in the eyes and gave me a firm handshake. That 6-year-old stood strong and tall and proud in front of the Commander in Chief, just as I am sure his dad would have wanted him to be. He's extraordinary.\nChristian's father gave his life to defend our freedoms and our flag. Christian, your father was an American hero, and we are so proud of what you are doing every day to carry on his legacy. And, Christian, we hope to prove worthy of the sacrifices your family has made. And believe me, we're going to work very hard to live up to your standard. Christian, stand up. Come on, Christian. [Applause] Thanks, Christian. Good job. Good job. Special guy.\nEvery day, our brave men and women in uniform are risking their lives to keep this country safe from murderous groups like ISIS, Al Qaida, and so many more. We must confront this evil that plagues humanity and eradicate it from our planet.\nThe vicious slaughters in Manchester and the streets of London underscore the depths of depravity that we face. But these atrocities only harden our resolve. We're getting better and better and tougher and tougher and smarter and smarter, Christian.\nWe cannot allow radical Islamic terrorism to spread in our country or allow extremists to find sanctuary on our shores. We will protect our country, we will protect our families, and our ways of life will always be protected. We will crush this enemy that is waging war on all of civilization.\nLast month, I traveled to Saudi Arabia to speak to the leaders of more than 50 Muslim and Arab countries and to rally them in the common fight against the terrorism, which is a menace to people of all religions. There can be no coexistence with this violence. I told these leaders that they must drive out this enemy from the face of the Earth. Every child of God, no matter where they live, what language they speak, or what book they live by, deserves to be able to grow up in harmony, dignity, and peace.\nIn that summit—the likes of which there has never been any summit like it; you've seen it, you watched it—we reached historic agreements to fight not only terrorism, but the wicked ideology that drives—really drives it; I mean, it's just driving it—and to starve this enemy of the funds: the billions and billions and billions of dollars that's being poured out into the enemy. I think it was one of the great, great summits. And I think it's going to have a profound effect on terrorism.\nFinally, because my administration is deeply committed to the right of religious believers everywhere to be free from persecution, I called on these leaders to protect Muslims and Christians and Jews and people of all faiths. Because you know what's going on there. And it's horrible, horrible. Terrorism, a threat, and it is a big threat to religious liberty around the world. And all responsible nations must protect the right of people to live and worship according to their conscience.\nHere in America, my administration is determined to work with you to protect your religious liberty, not just for some, but for everyone. Together, we can crush the horrors of terrorism. We can usher in a new era of faith, family, and freedom.\nBecause we understand that a nation is more than just a geography. A nation is the sum of its citizens, their hopes, their dreams, their values, and their prayers. America is a land rich with history and culture and filled with people of courage, kindness, and strength. And though we have many stories that we all share at home, the one thing we do share is one beautiful destiny. And whether we are Black or Brown or White, we all bleed the same red blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we are all made by the same Almighty God. We face many challenges. There are many hills and mountains to climb. But one by one, we will scale those summits, and we will get the job done and get the job done correctly. We will prove worthy of this very, very important moment in history. As long as we have pride in our beliefs, courage in our convictions, and faith in our God, then we will not fail.\nAnd as long as our country remains true to its values, loyal to its citizens, and devoted to its Creator, then our best days are yet to come, because we will make America great again.\nThank you. God bless you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-06-08", "title": "Remarks at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference"}

Comey, Jr., former Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126535", "text": "The President. Well, thank you all very much for being here. This is fantastic. In fact, what we'll do, in a minute, we'll go around the room real quickly. I see some extra people showed up, so that, frankly, we don't have too much room, Rick. It's a little tight in here.\nGovernor Richard L. Scott of Florida. We should all be in Florida, sir.\nThe President. It's a little tight, but that's okay. Great honor. And it's my pleasure to welcome so many incredible Governors, Tribal leaders, mayors, county commissioners, and other leaders of our country to the White House Infrastructure Summit. We're doing a great job with respect to infrastructure all over, and we're very proud of it. It's going to be—it's going to take off like a rocket ship, moving very quickly. Together, we're going to rebuild America.\nEarlier this week, we announced our plan to revolutionize air traffic control. And yesterday I traveled to Cincinnati to discuss our new vision for American infrastructure and our plans to modernize our vital inland waterways, which are so important and which are, in many cases, crumbling.\nToday we're here to talk about how we will create the infrastructure of the future by partnering with the States and local governments, of which you form a very important part, right? This is the group. And it's a great group.\nMayor Acquanetta Warren of Fontana, CA. Yes, that's right. That's right.\nThe President. You're the stewards of the vast majority of our Nation's roads and bridges and airports. Yet, for too long, Washington has slowed down your projects and driven up your costs and driven them up beyond anything even recognizable. Those days are over. We're going to move quickly, we're going to move very, very intelligently, and we're going to get the job done under budget and ahead of schedule, something the government doesn't hear too much.\nWe are already taking action to dramatically reduce the time it takes to get permits and approvals. If you want to build a highway in the United States, you currently have to obtain approvals, generally speaking, on average, 16. And usually, 10 Federal agencies are involved. It's a process that can take well over 10 years just to get the approvals. We're not talking about building; we're talking about just getting the approvals. So we want to streamline that process, and we think we can get it down to a number that's closer to 2 years and maybe even less than that. That would be a big, big difference.\nIn addition to reforming our broken permitting system, we want to partner with State and local governments to better meet the needs of our citizens. My budget proposal includes a massive investment in new Federal support for infrastructure. These dollars will be matched by significant private, State, and local dollars for maximum efficiency and accountability.\nAlready, many of you are pioneering innovative solutions for your citizens, and you're already looking at developments and working with us. To take just one example, in Florida, Governor Rick Scott—hello, Rick—has partnered with private sector investors—and he's really been partnering a lot—to build projects such as the I-4 Ultimate Project, which has been called the largest infrastructure project in State history. That's Florida, big State. It's going to be a great project. Because of their innovation approach and because of the way they went about getting it and getting the approvals, the project is anticipated to be completed 17 years earlier than it would have through more traditional funding methods.\nThese are the kinds of projects we want to see all across the country. Working together, I'm confident that we can translate every taxpayer dollar into new pavement on our streets, new locks and new dams, new pipes for our water. And I will tell you, we're just going to have a much better, more modern, more acceptable infrastructure.\nWe want to bring it to the top of the world. We've gone way down in the list. If you look worldwide, we have gone way, way down. We want to go back to the top. We used to be at the top every year, routinely. And now we've gone down quite a bit. So I don't like that, you don't like that, and we're going to change it.\nI just want to again say it's an honor to have you here. You're really the stewards of the great cities and the great States and the great areas and communities, and you're going to be very important to what we're going with infrastructure.\nSo I think what I'll do is start with Rick Scott in Florida and maybe just go around. You give the name, location. You have a couple of people from the press. Not too many. [Laughter] Let's see. Not too many. [Laughter] And I'm sure they're going to be excited to hear who you are. Are you—they're desperate to hear who you are, right, Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]? [Laughter]\n[At this point, the summit participants went around the table and introduced themselves. The President then continued as follows.]\nDonald Trump, President of the United States. [Laughter] Thank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\nMr. Karl. Mr. President, do you have a reaction to Comey's testimony? Any reaction at all?\nThe President. Thank you very much.

It is great to be in Georgia at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, a place of history and consequence in the life of this nation. (Applause.)\nIt's wonderful to see you all, servicemen and women in uniform and also your wonderful families. And I bring greetings from your Commander-in-Chief, a tireless defender of the Armed Forces of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nI want to thank General Parker for welcoming us here today and for his great leadership of the 94th Air Wing.\nAnd thank you to all leadership of this Air Reserve Base that's here with us today -- General Stokes, General Jarrard, General Simmons, and General Blackstock. We are so proud of the leadership and the men and women who serve at this great Air Reserve base. Could you give them all a big round of applause? They sure deserve it. (Applause.)\nAnd let also say I really enjoyed bringing some congressmen home to you today. I hope you saw them come off the plane. These are extraordinary men of principle -- who I can tell you having served with a few of them in the House of Representatives myself -- represent your state and represent your state's values so well -- Congressman Tom Graves, Congressman Doug Collins, Congressman Barry Loudermilk, Congressman Drew Ferguson, and Congressman Austin Scott. Would you give them and their families a big round of applause? (Applause.)\nAnd to all the men and women who serve here at Dobbins Air Reserve Base and your families who are here, it really is my honor to be with you today.\nIt's a particular honor, only four days after the anniversary of D-Day, to be here with a veteran of the Second World War. He joined the Navy on the day he turned 17, and I haven't spotted him yet. But Mr. Allan Hall is with us today. And on behalf of the American people and your entire generation, Allan, thank you for your service. (Applause.)\nThe Good Book says: If you owe debts, pay debts. If honor, then honor. If respect, then respect.\nI stand before you today on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, President Donald Trump, simply to pay a debt of honor and gratitude and respect to each one of you who stepped forward and put on the uniform of the United States. You've earned the well-deserved respect of the President of the United States, the people of Georgia, and the American people. The American people are proud of the men and women who serve in our armed forces at every level, and I'm here to tell you that. (Applause.)\nYou are the sons and daughters of freedom, and now you have stood up and stepped forward to defend that freedom in the uniform of the United States. You're patriots, all; heroes, all. You are the best of us, and everyone here in Georgia and every American is grateful to you. So I'm here today more than anything else to say thank you for your service. Thank you for your courage.\nAnd as the proud father of a United States Marine, let me also just take a moment to give these soldiers a chance to say thanks to all the family members who are with us here today who make it possible for the men and women of our Guard and Reserve to serve. (Applause.)\nThe truth is your loved ones enlist, but it's families who serve. And I know that well. So I just want to express again my appreciation for everyone who keeps the home fires burning. When you're sent overseas, as some in this unit are as we speak, it's the families that take care of things at home and give you the peace of mind to be able to step forward and serve our country.\nBut let's just take a minute and marvel at where we are today in this extraordinary place known as Dobbins Air Reserve Base. It's been a bastion of American strength for over 70 years. Since 1943, the air wings stationed here and the aircraft built here have flown for freedom across the globe -- over Europe and the Pacific in World War Two, over Korea and Vietnam, in Desert Storm and Enduring Freedom, and essentially every conflict in between.\nAs I prepared to come before you today, I learned that personnel from this base are, as we speak, downrange, in harm's way, serving freedom and serving the people of the United States with distinction, as people from Dobbins Air Reserve Base have done over the course of these more than seven decades.\nIt's remarkable to think that Dobbins Air Reserve Base is now the largest multi-service training base anywhere in the world. (Applause.)\nHere, our men and women in uniform train for combat and ready themselves for deployment at a moment's notice. Four hundred and ten airmen from the 94th are deployed overseas as we speak, and they're in our hearts and in our prayers.\nIn my last job, as governor of Indiana, I had the high honor to serve as commander-in-chief of the Indiana National Guard. It was the greatest privilege I had in that role. So I know firsthand the importance of our guardsmen and our reservists, and the heroic service that you and your families render. You serve both \"community and country\" and you complete the \"total force\" -- and make no mistake about it, you represent the unbreakable backbone of American freedom. And you have our deepest respect. (Applause.)\nTo all in our Guard and Reserve, know that your Commander-in-Chief is grateful for your service. And I'm here to tell you President Donald Trump is the best friend the Armed Forces of the United States will ever have. (Applause.)\nYou know, I can tell you, I told the President I was headed this way, and he wanted me to give you his thanks and his warmest respects and regards.\nServing with him every day, I can assure you President Donald Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people, and to protect our nation, this President has committed this administration and called on this Congress to make historic investments in our national defense. And this we will do. (Applause.)\nNow, just a few weeks ago, speaking before your brothers and sisters in arms stationed in Italy, our President, rightly, said, in his words, the men and women of the U.S. military have been the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world. And since day one of our administration, President Trump has been fighting tirelessly to rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy. And we will once again give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guard, Reserve and Guard the resources and the training you need to accomplish your mission to protect our country and come home safe. That is our pledge to you. (Applause.)\nAnd let me assure you, it's not just talk. Working with these distinguished members of Congress last month, the President signed a $21 billion increase in funding for the Armed Forces of the United States. It was the largest investment in military readiness in nearly 10 years. (Applause.)\nAnd just a few weeks ago, President Donald Trump sent his first budget to Capitol Hill and laid out our plans to work with this Congress, and we're going to pass the largest increase in military spending since the days of Ronald Reagan. We're going to get it done and we're going to rebuild our military. (Applause.)\nMen and women of Dobbins Air Reserve Base, you heard it from me: The era of budget cuts to the American Armed Forces is over and a new era of American strength has begun. (Applause.)\nOur President is determined to work with the Congress to make the strongest fighting force in history stronger still. And with renewed strength, our President is restoring America's rightful place in the world.\nIt really was inspiring, wasn't it, to see the President's leadership on the world stage during his historic trip to Europe and the Middle East just a few weeks ago. He affirmed our old alliances; he forged new partnerships. And every step of the way, we saw this President stepping without apology into America's role as leader of the free world. And under President Donald Trump, America will lead again. (Applause.)\nAnd this Commander-in-Chief made it clear we're going to stand with our allies and stand up to our enemies. And under President Trump's leadership, the strength of America's Armed Forces will come together, and we will hunt down and destroy ISIS at its sources, and we will drive the cancer of radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the Earth. (Applause.)\nIt seems like every day, we have another gruesome reminder of the threat that global terrorism places on our people and on our allies. It represents the greatest threat facing our nation and our way of life. In just the past week alone, we've seen horrific terrorist attacks in our cherished allies, Australia and the United Kingdom. Our hearts break for the families of the victims and the injured in London, and Melbourne. They're the latest innocents to suffer at the hands of terrorists, joining those who fell in Manchester, Kabul, Paris, Istanbul, Brussels, Berlin, San Bernardino, and so many others from barbaric acts of terrorism. They and their families have our prayers.\nBut more than that, they have our unwavering resolve. As this President said earlier this week, with the strength of the Armed Forces of the United States of America and the resolve of the American people, this bloodshed will end. I promise you.\nAs we speak, your brothers and sisters in uniform are taking the fight to terrorists on our terms on, their soil, and people from this base are in the fight. ISIS is on the run in Syria. They're on the run in Iraq. We're driving them out of Mosul. We're driving them toward their capital of Raqqa. And President Donald Trump will not rest and will not relent until we destroy ISIS at its source so it can no longer threaten our people or threaten our allies or freedoms around the world. (Applause.)\nBut in this time of widening challenges and unknowable threats, all of you must continue to be ready. Brave men and women of Dobbins Air Reserve Base may yet be called upon again in a wider way to be instruments of American power. And when that day comes, your Commander-in-Chief and I know you'll be prepared to do what those who have gone before have done. For you know full well, in this place and in the great state of Georgia, as the Old Book says, the soldier does not bear the sword in vain. We know you will be ready when you are called.\nWhile we must always work and hope and pray for peace, the best way to protect the peace is for our adversaries to know without exception that America is always prepared to fight and win any contest, any struggle, any war where the freedom and national interests of the United States of America are at stake. (Applause.)\nUnder President Trump, the United States will be strong -- stronger than ever before. We'll be strong in arms. We'll be strong in will. And just as we have been since the hour of our nation's birth, under President Trump, America will be strong in our conviction that our cause is just and freedom is worth defending.\nAnd I truly do stand before you today very humbled. See, I'm the father of a Marine, and I'm the son of a combat veteran. But unlike those of you that are proudly wearing the green today, my life didn't take me into the uniform of the United States. But as I stand before you today as I've had the privilege to stand before men and women in uniform across this country and around the world, I can just tell you: I look in your eyes, I see your determination, I know of your professionalism, and I know of the sacrifices of you and your family, and I have faith. I have faith that together with you, standing on the ramparts of freedom, that we will make America safe again. And we will make America prosperous again. And to borrow a phrase, strongly standing with our military here in Georgia and all across the nation and all across the world, we will make America great again. (Applause.)\nThank you all very much. Thank you for coming out. And thank you for you service to the United States of America. God bless you all.

I want to really thank you. You have been so amazing as the leader of this department, and the progress is being made so quickly. But leaders and officials, gathered here from across the country, have all praised the work that the Secretary is doing to create a safe, modern and reliable transportation system for the United States and for its great, great, great people.\nI also want to thank Secretary Zinke for the fantastic job he's doing at the Department of the Interior to clear the way for new infrastructure and economic development.\nBoth Secretary Chao and Zinke joined us at the White House yesterday for a meeting with State and local leaders to develop plans to replace America's decaying infrastructure and construct new roads, rails, pipelines, tunnels, and bridges all across our Nation.\nWe are here today to focus on solving one of the biggest obstacles to creating this new and desperately needed infrastructure, and that is the painfully slow, costly, and time-consuming process of getting permits and approvals to build. And I also knew that from the private sector. It is a long, slow, unnecessarily burdensome process.\nMy administration is committed to ending these terrible delays once and for all. The excruciating wait time for permitting has inflicted enormous financial pain to cities and States all throughout our Nation and has blocked many important projects from ever getting off the ground. Many, many projects are long gone because they couldn't get permits, and there was no reason for it.\nWe've already taken historic steps to speed up the approvals, including the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which was very quickly approved. They were sitting there for a long time saying, well, that project is dead. Then, I came into office and, all of the sudden, a miracle. And I guarantee you, the consultants went over to the heads of the company and told them what a great job they did. [Laughter] They asked for a lot of money, most likely. But we got it approved. And we got it approved fast.\nI'm also very proud to say that the Dakota Access Pipeline is now officially open for business. It was dead 120 days ago, and now it officially just opened for business. Very proud of that. Hi, Bill.\nWe're also excited to be joined by representatives from our labor unions, including the North America Building Trades Union, which I know well, and the Laborers International Union of North America. You will play a—go ahead, fellas, take a little credit. Come on, fellas. You will play a central role in rebuilding America. Very important.\nWe're also joined, as well, by many distinguished Members of Congress who share our total passion and desire to repair and restore America's highways, railways, and waterways. In the audience is a man that I've gotten to know well and who is doing some job—and it's not easy, but it's going to get a lot easier—Chairman Bill Shuster of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Stand up, Bill. Thank you, Bill, great job—who is working very closely with us, including on our proposal to dramatically reduce airport delays by reforming air traffic control.\nWe have an obsolete system. And I have to say, before Elaine got here, they had spent close to $7 billion on the system. Boom, a waste. All wasted. But we're going to have a great system—great new system, the top of the line—it will be the best in the world. Right now we're at the lowest part of the pack. It will be the best in the world, for a lot less money than they've been wasting for years.\nFor too long, America has poured trillions and trillions of dollars into rebuilding foreign countries while allowing our own country—the country that we love—and its infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair. We have structurally deficient bridges, clogged roads, crumbling dams and locks. Our rivers are in trouble. Our railways are aging. And chronic traffic that slows commerce and diminishes our citizens' quality of life. Other than that, we're doing very well. [Laughter]\nInstead of rebuilding our country, Washington has spent decades building a dense thicket of rules, regulations, and red tape. It took only 4 years to build the Golden Gate Bridge and 5 years to build the Hoover Dam and less than 1 year to build the Empire State Building. People don't believe that. It took less than 1 year. But today, it can take 10 years and far more than that just to get the approvals and permits needed to build a major infrastructure project.\nThese charts beside me are actually a simplified version of our highway permitting process. It includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different Federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes.\nAs one example—and this happened just 30 minutes ago—I was sitting with a great group of people responsible for their State's economic development and roadways. All of you are in the room now. And one gentleman from Maryland was talking about a 18-mile road. And he brought with him some of the approvals that they've gotten and paid for. They spent $29 million for an environmental report, weighing 70 pounds and costing $24,000 per page.\nAnd I said, do me a favor. I'm going to make a speech in a little while. Do you mind if I take that and show it? So I'm going to show it.\n[At this point, the President walked to a table with a stack of three large binders on it and flipped through the top one, displaying it for the audience.]\nHere it is: phase one. Look at this. Okay. [Laughter]\n[The President dropped the first binder to the floor and held up the second binder, flipping through the pages for the audience.]\nPhase two. Here's two. Nobody is going to read it. [Laughter] Except for the consultants who get a fortune for this. And they fight us all the way, but they don't have the impact. Here, look at this. Okay, that's phase two.\n[The President dropped the second binder to the floor.]\nHere is another one. They don't even know what this is. They just—[laughter].\n[The President flipped through the pages of the third binder.]\nSo this cost—I'd better make sure I move it. I don't want to trip on the way out. That would be a big story. [Laughter] [The President kicked the two binders on the floor to the side and walked back to the podium.]\nEspecially to trip over that. So they spent millions and millions of dollars. When I said, how long has this short roadway been talked about, the gentleman said, well, if you say 20 years, you're safe. I said, yes, don't say anymore because I have to be—you know, I have to be exactly accurate with these people back there. [Laughter] If I was off by, like, 2 months, it's a major front page story.\nBut these binders on the stage could be replaced by just a few simple pages, and it would be just as good. It was actually be much better. Because these binders also make you do unnecessary things that cost billions and billions of dollars, and they actually make it worse.\nAs another example, the 23—if you look at it, in Ohio, the Ohio River Bridge—$2.3 billion. The project amassed a 150,000-page administrative record; 150,000 pages is a five-story-tall building. Think of it. If you put the paper together, it's a five-story building.\nHow can a country prosper under this kind of nonsense? And I know it. I know it so well, being in the private sector. But you know, in the private sector, you move, and you wheel, and you deal, and you hope, and you pray. And maybe it goes a little faster, but it's a horrible thing in the private sector also. And we're talking about reducing that for the private sector likewise.\nWhy should we continue to accept what is so clearly unacceptable? Oftentimes, for consultants—that are making a fortune because you can't doing anything without hiring them, paying them a tremendous amount of money, having them write up this nonsense—you can't get approvals. And they're in, in the case of New York, Albany—they go to Albany, the State capital. Or here, they go to Washington for Federal. And they want to make it really tough because that way, you have to hire them. It's a terrible thing. It's a group of people—probably nobody has ever heard anybody talk about it, because—I know it because I'm a business guy; I understand it. They work really hard to make it difficult. And some are believers, but most aren't. Most want to make a lot of money. So they make a very, very simple roadway or whatever you want to be building a very complicated subject, and they make it very much more expensive, and they make it worse. It's not as good as it would have been.\nI was not elected to continue a failed system. I was elected to change it. All of us in government service were elected to solve the problems that have plagued our Nation. We are here to think big, to act boldly, and to rise above the petty partisan squabbling of Washington, DC. We are here to take action. It's time to start building our country, with American workers and with American iron and aluminum and steel. It's time to put up soaring new infrastructure that inspires pride in our people and our towns.\nWhen I approved the Keystone Pipeline, I said, where was the pipe made? Unfortunately, they had purchased a lot of it, but I put a little clause at the bottom: You want to build a pipeline in this country, buy American steel, and let it be fabricated here. Very simple little clause written in hand, but it does the trick.\nIt is time, at last, to put America first. Americans deserve the best infrastructure anywhere in the world. They deserve roads and bridges that are safe to travel and pipes that deliver clean water into their homes, not like what happened in Flint, Michigan. They deserve lanes of commerce that get people and products where they need to go on time. Most of all, Americans deserve a system of infrastructure that is looked upon not with pity—the world, in many cases, is so far advanced that they look at our infrastructure as being sad. We want them to look at us with envy, a system worthy of our magnificent country. No longer can we allow these rules and regulations to tie down our economy, chain up our prosperity, and sap our great American spirit. That is why we will lift these restrictions and unleash the full potential of the United States of America.\nTo all of our State and local leaders, I appreciate your being here today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Bill. I want you to know that help is finally—after many, many decades—on its way. We are giving control back to the cities and the States. You know best how to plan your communities, analyze your projects, and protect your local environment.\nWe will get rid of the redundancy and duplication that wastes your time and your money. Our goal is to give you one point of contact to deliver one decision, yes or no, for the entire Federal Government and to deliver that decision quickly, whether it's a road, whether it's a highway, a bridge, a dam.\nTo do this, we are setting up a new Council to help project managers navigate the bureaucratic maze. This Council will also improve transparency by creating a new online dashboard allowing everyone to easily track major projects through every stage of the approval process. This council will make sure that every Federal agency that is consistently delaying projects by missing deadlines will face tough, new penalties. I know it won't happen with these two. We don't have to worry about them. We will hold the bureaucracy accountable.\nWe are also creating a new office in the Council of Environmental Quality to root out inefficiency, clarify lines of authority, and streamline Federal and State, local procedures so that communities can modernize their aging infrastructure without fear of outdated Federal rules getting in their way.\nThis massive permit reform—and that's what it is; it's a permit reform—doesn't sound glamorous. They won't write stories about it. They won't even talk about it. But it's so important. But it's only the first step in renewing America's roads, rails, runways, and rivers.\nAs I discussed in Ohio recently, my new vision for American infrastructure will generate $1 trillion in infrastructure investment, which we desperately need. We've spent, as of a few months ago, $6 trillion in the Middle East—think of it—$6 trillion in the Middle East. And it's worse than it was 15 years ago by a factor of 10. And yet if you want to build a little road in one of your communities in Pennsylvania or Ohio or in Iowa or in North Carolina or in Florida, you can't get the money.\nState and local leaders will have more power to decide which projects get built, when they start and how they are funded. And investors will have a much more predictable environment that encourages them to invest billions of dollars in capital that is currently stuck on the sidelines.\nTogether, we will build projects to inspire our youth, employ our workers, and create true prosperity for our people. We will pour new concrete, lay new brick, and watch new sparks light our factories as we forge metal from the furnaces of our Rust Belt and our beloved heartland, which has been forgotten, but's not forgotten anymore.\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of our country. American workers will construct gleaming new lanes of commerce across our landscape. They will build these monuments from coast to coast and from city to city. And with these new roads, bridges, airports, and seaports, we will embark on a wonderful new journey into a bright and glorious future. We will build again. We will grow again. We will thrive again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-06-09", "title": "Remarks on Infrastructure Development and Federal Regulatory Policy"}

In his remarks, the President referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist organization. A reporter referred to former National Security Michael T. Flynn; and President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126349", "text": "President Trump. Thank you very much. President Iohannis, thank you for being here. It's an honor to welcome such a good friend of America to the White House.\nAs you know, the people of Romania and America share much in common: a love of freedom, proud cultures, rich traditions, and a vast and storied landscape to call home. The relationship between our two countries stretches back well over a century. But today we especially reaffirm and celebrate our strategic partnership that began more than 20 years ago. That partnership covers many dimensions, including economic, military, and cultural ties. And today we are making those ties even stronger.\nMr. President, your visit comes at an important moment not just in this partnership, but among all of the responsible nations of the world. I have just returned from a historic trip to Europe and the Middle East, where I worked to strengthen our alliances, forge new friendships, and unite all civilized peoples in the fight against terrorism. No civilized nation can tolerate this violence or allow this wicked ideology to spread on its shores. I addressed a summit of more than 50 Arab and Muslim leaders—a unique meeting in the history of nations—where key players in the region agreed to stop supporting terrorism, whether it be financial, military, or even moral support.\nThe nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level, and in the wake of that conference, nations came together and spoke to me about confronting Qatar over its behavior. So we had a decision to make: Do we take the easy road, or do we finally take a hard but necessary action? We have to stop the funding of terrorism. I decided—along with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, our great generals, and military people—the time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding—they have to end that funding—and its extremist ideology in terms of funding.\nI want to call on all other nations to stop immediately supporting terrorism. Stop teaching people to kill other people. Stop filling their minds with hate and intolerance. I won't name other countries, but we are not done solving the problem, but we will solve that problem. We have no choice.\nThis is my great priority because it is my first duty as President to keep our people safe. Defeating ISIS and other terror organizations is something I have emphasized all during my campaign and right up until the present. To do that, stop funding, stop teaching hate, and stop the killing. For Qatar, we want you back among the unity of responsible nations. We ask Qatar and other nations in the region to do more and do it faster.\nI want to thank Saudi Arabia and my friend, King Salman, and all of the countries who participated in that very historic summit. It was truly historic. There has never been anything like it before and perhaps there never will be again. Hopefully, it will be the beginning of the end of funding terrorism. It will, therefore, be the beginning of the end to terrorism. No more funding.\nI also want to thank the Romanian people for everything they contribute to our common defense and to the fight against the evil menace of terrorism. They have their own difficulties with it, and they've come a long way, and they're doing a lot. Romania has been a valuable member of the coalition to defeat ISIS, and it's the fourth largest contributor of troops in Afghanistan. There, 23 of your citizens have paid the ultimate price. And America honors their sacrifice.\nI want to recognize President Iohannis for his leadership in committing Romania this year to increase its defense spending from 1.4 percent of GDP to over 2 percent. We hope our other NATO allies will follow Romania's lead on meeting their financial obligations and paying their fair share for the cost of defense. But I will say this: that because of our actions, money is starting to pour into NATO. The money is starting to pour in. Other countries are starting to realize that it's time to pay up, and they're doing that. Very proud of that fact.\nAs you know, I have been an advocate for strengthening our NATO alliance through greater responsibility and burden sharing among member nations. And that is what is happening. Because, together, we can confront the common security challenges facing the world.\nMr. President, I want to applaud your courage and your courageous efforts in Romania to fight corruption and defend the rule of law. This work is necessary to create an environment where trade and commerce can flourish and where citizens can prosper. I look forward to working with you to deepen the ties of both commerce and culture between our two countries.\nRomanians have made contributions to the United States and to the world. Very notable among them was Nobel Prize laureate Elie Wiesel, who was born in Romania and, sadly, passed away almost 1 year ago. And I understand that earlier this week, the American Jewish Committee presented President Iohannis with its very prestigious Light Unto the Nations Award for his work to further Holocaust remembrance and education in Romania. I join the AJC in saluting your leadership in that vital cause.\nThe people of Romania have endured many, many hardships, but they have made a truly remarkable, historical journey. The future of Romania and Romania's relationship with the United States is very, very bright.\nPresident Iohannis, I thank you for your leadership, and I thank you again for being here today. I look forward to strengthening our alliance with your country and our bonds with your people. The relationship has been good, but now it's stronger than ever.\nThank you very much.\nPresident Iohannis. President Trump, thank you so much for the words you found for Romania, for the Romanian people, and for me. Thank you very much for the invitation to be here today with you. And thank you so much for arranging this nice weather in this place.\nMr. President, I'm very glad that we had such a good meeting. And this is due to your strong leadership, and this is also due to our strong partnership. Obviously, the fact that we celebrate 20 years of strategic partnership this year is important for both our nations, and it is important to know—and this is what I want to underline—that this partnership with the United States of America shaped Romania as it is today.\nRomania, a solid democracy with a solid and sustainable economic growth. Romania which stands together with the U.S. troops in Afghanistan. We stand together in Iraq. Mr. President, this partnership contributed greatly to what Romania is today. And this partnership was and is very important. And I think this partnership not only has to continue, this partnership has to become stronger. This partnership has to define our bilateral relation, and this partnership has to contribute to solve so many problems.\nPresident Trump, you mentioned terrorism. I'm very glad that, due to your strong leadership, NATO decided to go against terrorism. Your involvement made so many nations conscious of the fact that we have to share the burden inside NATO. And this is why Romania also decided—and if I'm right, I think this is the first country during your mandate—to step up to 2 percent of GDP for defense spending. A significant part of this defense spending is going into strategic acquisitions. And I hope, President Trump, that we find good ways together to use—to make good use of this money.\nRomania is very conscious of the fact that we stand on the eastern flank, and we heavily rely on your partnership, President Trump, because we cannot stand there without the U.S. We cannot stand there alone. On the other hand, our partnership has a huge opportunity to step up not only in security matters, but also in commercial and economic matters. And this is very important.\nRomania is a member of the European Union. And I think it's the best interest of you, Mr. President, to have a strong European Union as a partner. This is vital for all of us. Our relationship, the transatlantic link is vital. The transatlantic link is not about diplomacy, about policy; it's at the basis of our Western civilization. And together, we will make it stronger. Together, we will make it better.\nNATO and the European Union do not have to compete against each other. They have to work together. They have to work in such a manner as to produce synergetic effects: make NATO stronger, make European stronger, make the United States of America stronger.\nAnd this is what we decided, President Trump and I, to make our partnership stronger, better, more enduring. And this will lead very soon to an enhanced economic exchange, to better commerce. And this is what we all decide and what we wish, because we are responsible, President Trump and I, not only for the security. We are responsible for the well-being of our citizens. And this is what we are decided to do.\nThank you so much, President Trump.\nPresident Trump. Thank you.\nDave Boyer, Washington Times, please. Dave. Come on, Dave. Got to get going here, Dave. [Laughter]\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. Apologies.\nPresident Trump. That's all right, Dave.\nFormer Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr.'s Testimony Before the Senate Intelligence Committee/2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Mr. President, this morning, on Twitter, you were referring to the testimony of James Comey vindicating you. But I wondered if you could tell us in person, sir, why you feel that his testimony vindicated you when it's really—boils down to his word against your word. And if you could also tell us, sir, do tapes exist of your conversations with him?\nPresident Trump. Yes. Well, I'll tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near future. But in the meantime, no collusion, no obstruction. He's a leaker. But we want to get back to running our great country: jobs; trade deficits, we want them to disappear fast; North Korea, a big problem; Middle East, a big problem. So that's what I am focused on. That's what I have been focused on.\nBut yesterday showed no collusion, no obstruction. We are doing really well. That was an excuse by the Democrats who lost an election that some people think they shouldn't have lost, because it's almost impossible for the Democrats to lose the electoral college, as you know. You have to run up the whole East Coast, and you have to win everything as a Republican. And that's just what we did.\nSo it was a—just an excuse. But we were very, very happy. And frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said. And some of the things that he said just weren't true.\nThank you very much.\nDo you have a question?\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization\nQ. Thank you. And, Mr. President, if you could tell us—a couple weeks ago, President Trump was in Brussels at the NATO meeting, and not only was he encouraging NATO members to pay up the 2 percent required of GDP for national defense, but he also was saying that countries, including yours, who had not paid 2 percent in the past should make up for that difference. Do you think that's fair?\nPresident Iohannis. I was in Brussels, and I met President Trump, and I listened to his speech, and I liked it. Because, you see, NATO is based on values, but it is ultimately a military alliance. And you know, military spendings are complicated, and you need a lot of money, because NATO is the strongest alliance the Earth ever saw, and we want to keep it that way.\nSo we have to spend money for defense purposes. And spending money means, if you're in alliance, everybody has to spend money. This is called burden sharing. And I fully agree, Mr. President, to that.\nSo of course, some people liked this better, and some didn't like it so much. But it's a simple fact that we have to do this. Not as a purpose in itself; we have to do this to stay strong, to be strong, and to defend our nations.\nPresident Trump. One-hundred percent correct. And you know, one of the things I was referring to during that speech was the fact that, yes, they haven't paid what they should be paying now, but for many years, they haven't been paying. So I said, do we ever go back and say, how about paying the money from many, many years passed?\nNow, I know no President has ever asked that question. But I do. And we're going to make NATO very strong. We need the money to make it strong. You can't just do what we've been doing in the past. So I did say, yes, you haven't paid this year, but what about the past years, the many past years where you haven't paid? Perhaps you should pay some or all of that money back.\nYou have a question?\n[At this point, President Iohannis called on a reporter.]\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization Q. Thank you. I have a question for President Trump. On the matter of security, sir, you—many of the countries on the eastern flank of NATO, including Romania, see Russia as a threat to the security and the peace in the region. Do you share this vision? And do you think that United States should act under article 5 if any of these countries will be under military aggression?\nThank you very much.\nPresident Trump. Well, I'm committing the United States, and have committed, but I'm committing the United States to article 5. And certainly, we are there to protect. And that's one of the reasons that I want people to make sure we have a very, very strong force by paying the kind of money necessary to have that force. But yes, absolutely, I'd be committed to article 5.\n[President Iohannis called on another reporter.]\nVisa Waiver Program\nQ. Thank you. Mr. President, were there any discussion about the Visa Waiver Program for Romania? Is there a timeframe for including our country in this program? Thank you.\nPresident Trump. We didn't discuss it——\nPresident Iohannis. Yes——\nPresident Trump. We didn't discuss it. But there would be certainly—it would be something we will discuss.\nMr. President.\nPresident Iohannis. I mentioned this issue, and I also mentioned it during other meetings I had, because this is important for us, it's important for us; it's important for Romanians who want to come to the United States. And you see, more and more people come, President Trump, from Romania to the United States. Some come as tourists. Some come for business. And those who come for business should be encouraged.\nSo the matter of visa waiver would be probably important to discuss. And we all hope that we will advance on this.\nPresident Trump. Good.\nOh, look at those hands up there, President. Do you have this in Romania too? I don't know. [Laughter] Oh boy!\nQ. Yes. I've got the microphone. If you'll allow me, Mr. President——\nPresident Trump. If I could only sell that. If I could only sell it.\nWho would like to ask—should I take one of the killer networks that treat me so badly as fake news? Should I do that? Huh?\nGo ahead, Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. Be fair, Jon.\nQ. Oh, absolutely.\nPresident Trump. Remember how nice you used to be before I ran? Such a nice man.\nFormer Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr.'s Testimony Before the Senate Intelligence Committee/Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III/The President's Past Conversations With Former Director Comey Q. Always fair. Mr. President, I want to get back to James Comey's testimony. You suggested he didn't tell the truth in everything he said. He did say, under oath, that you told him to let the Flynn—you said you hoped the Flynn investigation you could let go—he could let——\nPresident Trump. I didn't say that.\nQ. So he lied about that?\nPresident Trump. Well, I didn't say that. I mean, I will tell you I didn't say that.\nQ. And did he ask you to pledge his loyalty——\nPresident Trump. And there would be nothing wrong if I did say it, according to everybody that I've read today. But I did not say that.\nQ. And did he ask for a pledge of loyalty from you? That's another thing he said.\nPresident Trump. No, he did not.\nQ. So he said those things under oath. Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events?\nPresident Trump. One-hundred percent. I didn't say under oath—I hardly know the man. I'm not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it. I hardly know the man. It doesn't make sense. No, I didn't say that, and I didn't say the other.\nQ. So if Robert Mueller wanted to speak with you about that, you would be willing to talk to him?\nPresident Trump. I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you, Jon.\nQ. And you seem to be hinting that there are recordings of those conversations.\nPresident Trump. I'm not hinting anything. I'll tell you about it over a very short period of time.\n[Other reporters began asking questions along with Mr. Karl.]\nQ. When is that? Is that in public?\nPresident Trump. Okay? Do you have a question here?\nQ. When will you tell us about the recordings?\nPresident Trump. Over a fairly short period of time.\nQ. Why won't you tell us now, sir?\nQ. Tomorrow? Now?\nQ. Are there tapes, sir?\nPresident Trump. Oh, you're going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer. Don't worry. [Laughter]\nJon, do you have a question for the President?\nQ. Yes. Thank you. And, President Iohannis, you are no stranger to Russian aggression. Vladimir Putin recently suggested that Romania could be in Russia's crosshairs. Are you—how concerned should the world be about Russian aggression in your region? And how concerned should we be here in the United States about what Russia tried to do in our election, sir?\nPresident Iohannis. Everybody is concerned. But you see, being concerned should lead you to being prepared. So in my opinion, we have to be very clear, very simple and very straightforward if we talk about Russia and with Russia. In my opinion, we need dialogue. But on the other hand, we need what we all together decided in NATO, a strong deterrence. So this combination—strong deterrence and dialogue—should lead towards a solution which is feasible for every part.\n[President Iohannis called on another reporter.]\nRomania-U.S. Relations\nQ. Hello, Mr. President Trump. You mentioned earlier the anticorruption fight in Romania. It is a matter of high importance in our country. But we see now that the anticorruption fight and the efforts to consolidate the rule of law are sometimes undermined by some politicians, part of what we can call the Bucharest swamp. Is your administration going to support the anticorruption fight in Romania? And how can you do it? Thank you.\nPresident Trump. Well, we support very strongly Romania. And therefore, obviously, we do support that fight on anticorruption. We will always support that. And we support your President. We think he's done an outstanding job. Very popular, very solid, working very hard. We know everything that's going on. And, yes—and he's going to win that fight. He's going to win that battle. But he has our support.\nPresident Iohannis. Thank you so much.\n[Another reporter asked a follow-up question.]\nQ. Do you think corruption in Romania is a problem for the U.S.-Romania partnership and for the American investor—[inaudible]—because we still have corruption in Romania, despite this anticorruption fight?\nPresident Trump. Well, you do. But I can tell you that there are many American investors right now going to Romania and investing. In fact, I was given a chart just before our meeting, and we have people going over to Romania and investing, and they weren't doing that a number of years ago. So that shows very, very big progress. And there really are a lot of congratulations in store. But a lot of people are investing from our country to yours.\nAnd people love—from Romania—the United States. And they come here a lot, and we're very proud of them.\nThank you all very much.", "timestamp": "2017-06-09", "title": "The President's News Conference With President Klaus Iohannis of Romania"}

It is great to be back, great to be back with you all and back with my friend, Governor Scott Walker. More on him in a moment.\nBefore I begin, though, allow me to take a moment to acknowledge what I learned about on my way here to Wisconsin today, the loss of American servicemembers that took place in Afghanistan. On my way here, I was informed that U.S. servicemembers were killed and wounded in an attack in Afghanistan. The President and I have been briefed. The details of this attack will be forthcoming.\nBut suffice it to say, when heroes fall, Americans grieve, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these American heroes.\nIt is great to be back in the Badger State. Thank you all for the warm welcome. And I bring greetings today from my friend, the man that Wisconsin voted overwhelmingly to make the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThe President asked me to be here today to thank the good people of Wisconsin not only for that decisive victory but also to assure you that the Badger State has a friend in the White House. You'll hear that firsthand when President Trump comes to Wisconsin on this coming Tuesday, and I know you're all looking forward to it.\nFolks, in President Donald Trump, you elected a fighter and a winner, and he will never stop fighting for the American people and his agenda to make America great again. I promise you that. (Applause.)\nBut you all know about fighters, because that's also a pretty good description of the man who just gave me that very kind introduction.\nYou know, I've met quite a few governors over the years. I've even had the privilege to be one myself, in the state of Indiana. So let me just say, I mean it from my heart when I tell you, Governor Scott Walker is one of the best governors in the history of this state and in this history of this country. Would you all mind getting on your feet and giving a rousing round of applause to Governor Scott Walker for the leadership that he provides every day. (Applause.)\nLet me also thank two more distinguished Wisconsin public servants who are here today. I had the opportunity to serve with the first one in Washington, D.C., for all of my 12 years in the Congress, and I know full well that in Washington, D.C., there is no great stalwart for conservative principles and values that Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us today. (Applause.) Thank you for that. So well deserved.\nAnd also I'm so honored to be joined by another principled leader who fights for Wisconsin and fights for conservative values every day, Congressman Glenn Grothman. Thank you so much for being here. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump and I couldn't be more grateful for the support of both of these leaders in the Congress of the United States.\nAnd let me also thank our host today, Bob Hillis and the whole team here at Direct Supply for welcoming us to this extraordinary campus and this extraordinary American success story. (Applause.)\nIt's been 30-plus years, you've built everything that matters, Bob -- a good name, a strong and prosperous company that has made this community and made this state better for it. Direct Supply is a true American success story, and that round of applause is so well deserved.\nYou know, I like to say that President Donald Trump has a three-part agenda for this administration -- jobs, jobs, and jobs. And we are here to talk about the kind of changes that will promote a growing America. (Applause.)\nSince day one of this administration, our President has taken decisive action to put America back to work and get our economy moving again.\nFirst off, if you haven't noticed, the American people elected a builder to be the 45th President of the United States of America. And we're actually at the end of what the President called Infrastructure Week, and I'm going to make you a promise -- and people heard about it all across Washington, D.C. and all across America -- President Donald Trump is going to keep his promise to rebuild the infrastructure of America and give us the best roads and bridges and airports and ports in the world. (Applause.)\nJust a few days ago in Cincinnati, the President declared that in his words, the \"American people deserve the best infrastructure anywhere in the world.\" And he laid out a \"Buy American, Hire American\" plan to rebuild our country.\nPresident Trump is going to make historic investments in our national infrastructure so that Wisconsin and states all across this country will have the infrastructure the best we've ever had.\nBut this President's leadership doesn't stop there. From the outset of this administration, I'm glad to report to you that President Trump has signed more laws into effect to roll back red tape than any President in American history. (Applause.)\n? He's supported energy infrastructure in this country the day that he authorized the Keystone and Dakota pipelines to make affordable American energy flow for our business and our homes. (Applause.)\nAnd just over a week ago, President Donald Trump put American jobs and American workers first when he took decisive action to withdraw the United States of America from the Paris climate accord. (Applause.)\nIt really is remarkable. The burden placed on our country by the Paris climate accord, by one estimate, would have cost the American people 6.5 million jobs in the next 25 years, including 3 million manufacturing jobs, so important here in the heartland, while letting countries like China and India off virtually scot-free.\nIn withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, President Trump put Pittsburgh over Paris. He put Milwaukee over Milan. (Applause.) In a word, President Donald Trump put America first, and he always will.\nFolks, that's what American leadership looks like. And this President's leadership is making a difference every single day. American businesses are growing and investing in America again. They're creating jobs in this country instead of shipping them overseas.\nIn fact, since the outset of this administration over 600,000 new private-sector jobs have been created. And under President's watch, unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years. America is back under the leadership of President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nBut as the President Trump likes to say, at this White House that's just what we call a good start.\nAnd before I go one step further, let me just tell you from the outset that no matter what the media may be focused on on any given moment, I promise you President Donald Trump will never stop fighting. He will never stop working. He will never stop rolling up his sleeves every single day to ensure that the American people, and the agenda in their interest is advanced of good jobs, safe streets, and a boundless American future. Count on it. (Applause.)\nThe truth is that we've a lot of important work yet to do. And working with Wisconsin's leaders in the Congress, before this summer is out, maybe chief among those obligations, chief among those challenges is I promise you President Donald Trump and I are going to work our hearts out with these congressmen, and we're going to keep the promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nIt's mostly what brings me here today. We all remember the broken promises that helped Obamacare get passed to begin with.\nThey said if you like your doctor you could keep them. Remember that one?\nThey said if you like your health insurance you could keep it. We were told that health insurance costs would actually go down not up.\nEvery single one of those promises has been broken. Now we know the facts. Just last month, our administration released a new study proving that Obamacare has made health insurance unaffordable for millions of Americans.\nHere in Wisconsin, as the Governor just said, Obamacare has spiked premiums on the individual market by 93 percent in just the past four years. President Obama promised that you'd save up to $2,500, but the average premium costs nearly $3,000 per year more today than it did in 2013.\nAnd here's the disturbing thing, folks, Obamacare is a disaster here, but Wisconsin actually is doing better than most other states in the country.\n? Nationwide, Obamacare has more than doubled premiums for working families. From coast to coast, Americans are facing double-digit premium hikes heading into 2018. It's remarkable in some states we've actually seen health insurance premiums go up not by 93 percent, like here in Wisconsin, but in some cases, nearly 200 percent increases on working families and small businesses.\nWhile Americans are paying more, they're also actually also getting less for it.\nBeyond the premiums, Obamacare plans have skyrocketing deductibles. The cost of than $6,000 in deductible is average for what's called a cheap plan. I just heard about it from many of the business leaders that have gathered here today and shared their personal stories.\nObamacare plans offer fewer and fewer doctors and providers, making it much harder for working families to get the care that they need.\nThe American people know a bad deal when they see one, and that's why they're avoiding Obamacare like the plague. The truth is the most recent information shows that more than 115,000 Wisconsin citizens paid $22 million in penalties to the IRS rather than even buying an unaffordable Obamacare plan. And nationwide, 6.5 million Americans paid $3 billion in penalties instead of signing up for Obamacare.\nAnd going forward, many Americans might not even be able to sign for Obamacare if even they want to because health insurance companies are pulling out of Obamacare exchanges left and right. Wisconsin has already lost four insurers in the past few years. States across the country have lost 83 insurers in 2017 alone. In fact, at this very moment, a third of America's counties -- and five whole states -- only have one choice of insurance company, meaning they essentially have no choice at all.\nAnd it's only going to get worse. In just the past few months, health insurers have said that they're abandoning Obamacare in nearly two dozen markets, and tens of thousands of Americans, or more, won't have any insurance coverage at all.\nJust this week, more than 13,000 people in Ohio learned they'll have no Obamacare choices next year. In Missouri, 25 counties may be without health insurance coverage.\nAnd just next door, in Iowa, it looks like very soon 94 of 99 counties will have no Obamacare insurance to choose from at all, leaving tens of thousands of working families without access to the healthcare that they need.\nFolks, we're talking about real people, a real crisis -- and good people are being hurt for it, people like Julie Champine, who's actually here with us today.\nI just had a chance to visit with Julie and her husband, and her story is a story that literally millions of Americans are facing every day. Julie has been buying health insurance for her family on the individual market ever since 2004. Now, Julie I can tell is a hardworking American. She's a great woman and has worked in a small business and living out her dreams every day. She has a great family. She's a mother and grandmother. But she's had some health challenges and issues. And we talked about them, and health insurance has been vitally important to her.\nJulie wanted to believe it when President Obama promised her that she could keep her plan, that she keep her doctor under Obamacare, but she found out the hard way that that just wasn't true.\nJulie lost her family's health insurance plan. She lost her doctor. And ever since, Julie has been forced to buy health insurance on the Obamacare exchange -- insurance that she can't really afford, can't even use because the deductibles are so high. Last year alone Julie's Obamacare plan cost more than $9,000 in premiums, and it still had a deductible of $13,000.\nAnd it's only gotten worse. Late last year, Julie found out that her premiums were going to increase by another $2,600 in 2017. Her Obamacare plan costs more than her mortgage, and she can't even use it.\nFolks, Julie literally can't afford Obamacare. In fact, as she just shared with me, Julie made the choice to stop paying for her health insurance for three months just so she could afford to buy Christmas presents for her children and grandchildren.\nFolks, that's just plain wrong. No American should ever have to choose between their health care and their grandkids. It's heartbreaking. And as Julie says, she essentially has got to a place where she said, \"We have no hope.\"\nBut as I just told her, help is on the way. (Applause.)\nJulie is here and she's being willing to be the face of Obamacare's failures here. But she's hardly alone. I talked to people in Julie and her husband's situation every day, all across this country. We hear from them. I see them as I travel. She is living proof that Obamacare is collapsing and really taking the opportunities and frankly the quality of life of the American people with it.\nAs President Trump said just a few days ago, \"Obamacare is dead.\" That's why Obamacare must go. (Applause.)\nThe truth is you'd have to be blinded by partisanship not to believe otherwise -- and unfortunately some people are. Democrats in Congress to be exact.\nThey're the ones who gave us Obamacare, and now, as your congressmen will tell you, they won't lift a finger to help us rescue the American people from this mess that they created.\nLiterally every single Democrat in Washington, D.C. would rather let Obamacare continue to collapse and put an enormous burden on the American people than help President Trump and Republicans in the House and Senate bring healthcare relief to hardworking Americans like Julie.\nBut as I told her help is on the way, and the Obamacare nightmare is about to end. (Applause.)\nUnder President Donald Trump, we will rescue the American people from the disaster of Obamacare and give the American people the world-class healthcare that they deserve.\nAnd before this summer is out, we're going to finish what Wisconsin's own Speaker Paul Ryan started. And we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all. Can we hear it for Wisconsin's own Paul Ryan for the great work he's done. (Applause.)\nBuilding on the work that Speaker Ryan and these great members of Congress did, our administration is working as we speak with the leaders in the United States Senate -- leaders like Wisconsin's great Senator Ron Johnson -- to keep our promise to end this failed law, and I know he'll be there. (Applause.)\nWe're going to repeal Obamacare's job-killing mandates and remove the burden of Obamacare's taxes on the American people.\nWe're going to give Americans more choices with expanded health savings accounts and a new tax credit to help you buy the insurance you need at a price you can afford.\nWe're going to make sure that every American with preexisting conditions has access to the coverage and the care they need -- no exceptions. (Applause.)\nAnd we're going to reform and strengthen Medicaid to help the people who truly need it the most by giving states like Wisconsin the freedom and flexibility you need to take care of your most vulnerable -- because this President believes in state-based solutions, not one-size-fits-all mandates from Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\n? And the truth is under Governor Scott Walker, Wisconsin has already innovated to provide healthcare coverage for your most vulnerable. They've been setting the pace across the country. I know your governor is seeking even more freedom and flexibility with his \"Wisconsin Works for Everyone\" plan, and under this administration, I promise you Governor Walker will be able to bring Wisconsin solutions to meet the unique healthcare challenges facing the people of Wisconsin. When we repeal and replace Obamacare, Wisconsin will be able to design its own healthcare system for the people of this state. (Applause.)\nGovernor Walker is going to be able to do it the Wisconsin Way, which is as I like to say, is the American Way -- state-based solutions and reform.\nFolks, when the Congress sends us a repeal-and-replace bill to President Trump's desk, we're going to do nothing short of rescuing working Americans from the consequences of Obamacare's collapse. And it will be a historic day for American health care.\nIt'll create a dynamic national health-insurance market with lower costs, higher quality, and more choices for working families by the time we're done.\nIt'll give American businesses like all those that are gathered here today the freedom to give their employees the coverage that they want to give them, and that they need.\nAnd after seven failed years of Obamacare, we'll finally put the American people back in control of their own health care -- people like Julie and her family.\nMy friends, we've come to a pivotal moment in the life of our nation. For the past seven years, we've had a healthcare system based on the flawed premise that the federal government should order every American to buy health insurance, whether you want it or need it or not; that bureaucrats and politicians know better than patients and doctors what they need; and worst of all; that the American people can't be trusted to run their own lives or make their own healthcare choices as they see fit.\nWe have a chance before us today to restore a healthcare system based on the time-honored American principles of personal responsibility, free-market competition, state-based reform, and above all else, we have a chance to restore a healthcare system based on the ultimate American principle -- freedom and the freedom of the American people to live their lives and make their choices as they see fit. (Applause.)\nSo we got our work cut out for us. I mean we are talking about Washington, D.C. now. But I am confident that if all of you will speak up, all of you will continue to stand up, and let your leaders in Washington, D.C. know just how strongly you feel, Julie coming over here and sharing her story was deeply inspiring to me. These business leaders that came out and shared their story while the media looked on was deeply inspiring to me.\nBut make no mistake about it. This is an important time to let your voice be heard so that not only can we get this country on the right track when it comes to healthcare reform, but that we can put America back on the right track to opportunity, prosperity, and greater freedom for every American.\nFrom this day forward, I would submit to you that we need every ounce of your enthusiasm, your energy, your conviction, and your passion.\nAnd in these divided times in the life of our nation, I would tell you that from my heart that we might just need one more thing if you're of a mind.\nIn much more challenging times in the life of this nation, people that have taken time from time to bow the head and bend the knee have made a difference in this country. So it would be a good time to do that.\nNow I'm not talking about praying for any particular officeholder or any particular agenda. I rather like what Abraham Lincoln said when during his time he was asked once if he thought God was on the side of the Union Army. Lincoln responded, he said, rather than asking whether God is on our side, I'd rather concern myself more with whether we were on God's side.\nSo I'd just encourage you to pray for our country. Pray in these challenging times that Americans will continue to come together. Because I know that with your help, with these great leaders in your statehouse and great leaders in the Congress, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God's help, I know we're going to make America safe again. I know we're going to give Americans the ability to make choices in healthcare that will improve their lives again. I know we're going to make America prosperous again.\nAnd to borrow a phrase, I know we're going to make America great again.\nThank you very much. God bless you, Wisconsin, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-06-10", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President on the Repeal and Replace of Obamacare in Milwaukee, Wisconsin"}
{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126315", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you for that wonderful warm welcome. Thank you to my friend Ralph. All the distinguished guests who are here, members of Congress, our honorees, it is great to be back at the Faith and Freedom Coalition, the greatest pro-family, pro-freedom grassroots organization in the United States of America. (Applause.)\nAnd I am very honored to have the opportunity to help wrap up what I hear has been a great, great week in Washington, D.C. and be able to speak at this 2017 Road to Majority Policy Conference.\nYou know, normally it's my job to bring greetings from my boss, but I know you already heard from him on Thursday. (Applause.)\nAnd let me tell you, what you saw two days ago is what I see every single day: a leader with broad shoulders and a big heart, a believer, and an unapologetic champion of the God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the United States, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThanks to the support of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, last November President Trump won a historic victory.\nMore counties than any President since Ronald Reagan -- 30 of 50 states, states no Republican had carried in a generation. President Donald Trump turned the blue wall red, and we thank you for the support that made that possible. (Applause.)\nAs the Good Book says: If you owe debts, pay debts. If honor, then honor. If respect, then respect.\nAnd I'm really here just to pay a debt of gratitude to all of you who helped elect a President who is fighting every day to restore freedom in the country and to make this country great and strong once again.\nThe President said it on Thursday, but it's worth repeating -- the Faith and Freedom Coalition knocked on 1.2 million doors, made 10 million phone calls, sent out 22 million pieces of mail, distributed 30 million voter guides, and most importantly you elected one President who will never stop fighting for the values and ideals that make this nation great. (Applause.)\nAnd as we look out across this room, we see more friends than we can count; people that I've known for years; people I've stood together with in my days in the Congress, my days as a governor. We've fought the good fight in this movement together. And so before I go on let me just take a moment to say how humbling it is for me to stand before my friends of so many years as the 48th Vice President of the United States of America. Thank you, thank you for giving my little family the opportunity to serve. (Applause.)\nAnd speaking of my family, on Thursday night, we celebrated the 32nd anniversary of my marriage to the most wonderful woman in the world. (Applause.) Faith and grace and immense patience. Would you all welcome my wonderful wife, Karen Pence, the Second Lady of the United States of America? (Applause.)\nIt really is remarkable to think about everything the Faith and Freedom Coalition has achieved since your founding in 2009. In just eight years you've built chapters in all 50 states, brought together more than 1.7 million members and grassroots activists.\nAnd there's a lot of reason for your success. Because while this group may be young, the values you stand for are timeless.\nBut let me express a special thanks to a man who made tonight possible, a leader I've known for many years who literally has devoted his life to defending his extraordinary talents and his entire life to defending faith and freedom in America, ladies and gentlemen, would you just give a rousing round of appreciative applause to Ralph Reed. (Applause.)\nThis whole room is filled with patrons and patriots, all people -- each of one of you that has made an extraordinary difference in the life of this country, and I know you'll continue. But it's a particular joy for me tonight to be a part of a celebration of someone who deserves that description more than maybe anyone else I've ever met in this movement, the recipient of the Winston Churchill Lifetime Achievement Award, my mentor and my friend, Dr. James Dobson. (Applause.)\nI have long held the view that I don't think less of people who think more highly of me than I think of myself. (Laughter.) And throughout my public career, as he's been in the lives of so many men and women in public life, and in ministry, and in business, Dr. James Dobson has been a source of counsel and encouragement to me and my family all along the way.\nDr. Dobson, the truth is this award doesn't actually do you justice. You've done more for faith and freedom in your lifetime than, as Ralph just said, any one person could do in 10 lifetimes. Although I do think that it's probably mostly due to the fact that you married way up. (Laughter.) Would you all give Shirley Dobson another big round of applause? She is an amazing woman, and amazing lady. (Applause.)\nFrom the heart I have to tell you, Dr. Dobson, your faith, your matchless voice on the airwaves, the enormous body of written work that you've created in a lifetime has inspired millions. And not only is your country grateful, but I say with confidence: Great is your reward. You've made an eternal difference in the lives of millions. (Applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, one more time for Dr. James Dobson. Would you mind?\nThis truly is a gathering of consequence, of conviction, and courage. Let me echo what the President said to you just two days ago. He acknowledged that all of \"you fought hard\" -- and you fought hard for him and now rest assured, I see it every day, he is \"fighting hard for all of you.\" (Applause.)\nEven before he took his oath of office, President Trump has been keeping his promise to the men and women gathered here and all those you represent across this country.\nFor starters, our President I believe has assembled one of the strongest conservative Cabinets in the history of the United States of America. (Applause.)\nHow about – U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley? (Applause.) How about Secretary of Defense Jim \"Mad Dog\" Mattis? (Applause.) And how about the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Dr. Ben Carson? (Applause.)\nThat's the A-Team. And since day one, this President has taken decisive action to make this country great again.\nPresident Trump told you on Thursday and I can tell you it's true that he will in his words \"battle for every American who has lost a job, for every family who has lost a loved one, for every American of faith who has lost their rights and lost their freedom.\" That's exactly what he's done.\nOur President has been busy since the first day of this administration, rolling back big government, slashing through red tape. In fact, this President has signed more bills into law rolling back federal regulations and red tape than any President in American history. (Applause.)\nHe's unleashing American energy and unburdening American businesses. He's putting America back to work, and he's fighting every day to put America First, which was on full display just last week, when President Donald Trump pulled the United States of America out of the Paris climate accord. (Applause.)\n? It's amazing to think that international deal the last administration entered into would have cost 6.5 million jobs in this country in the next 25 years, imposed incredible burdens on the American people while at the same time allowing countries like China and India to get off virtually scot-free. In his decision, the President put American workers first. He put America's future first. And I promise you that President Donald Trump will always put America First! (Applause.)\nThis President also knows that security is the foundation of our prosperity. That's why President Trump has been standing without apology for the men and women of law enforcement and those who protect our borders. (Applause.)\nHe's rebuilding our military and restoring America's place in the world. He's been standing with our allies and standing up to our enemies. And if the world knows nothing else, the world will know this, under President Donald Trump, America stands with Israel. (Applause.)\nAnd this President has been keeping faith with the Constitution of the United States and the God-given liberties enshrined there.\nJust last month, I had the great privilege to stand beside President Trump as he signed an executive order to help strengthen and restore that most fundamental right from the First Amendment of the Constitution, the freedom of religion. (Applause.)\nSpeaking from the Rose Garden, President Trump declared in his words that the \"federal government will never, ever penalize any person for their protected religious beliefs.\" (Applause.) And he directed our Department of Justice to ensure the freedom of religion of every American is protected.\nAnd our President began to ensure that the pulpits of America would be free, as well, to start the process to roll back the Johnson Amendment because free speech shouldn't stop at the doors of our churches, synagogues, and places of worship. (Applause.)\nJust rest assured, President Trump is going to continue to fight to ensure that every American has the freedom to follow the dictates of their conscience, and to add their voices and their values to the beautiful tapestry of our American life.\nAnd this President has also stood strongly on the world stage with those who are persecuted for faith around the globe.\nUnder President Donald Trump, America has made it clear: This nation condemns persecution of any faith in any place at any time, and we will confront it with all of our abilities in the world. (Applause.)\nProtecting and promoting religious freedom is a foreign policy priority of this administration. And President Trump will fight every day for this fundamental right, at home and abroad.\nYou know, it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President, as well, to a President who is so committed to protecting our most cherished freedoms. But honestly, I couldn't be more proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.)\nAnd it's not just been words, it's been deeds. In one of the very first acts in office, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy banning public funding of abortion providers abroad, and last month our President expanded that policy to cover nearly $9 billion in American foreign aid. (Applause.)\nAnd it was my great honor with my wife at my side to have the President personally send me to be the first Vice President ever to speak at the annual March for Life. (Applause.)\nHe signed also into law legislation that will empower states to withhold federal funding from abortion providers, and I'm humbled to say that at the President's direction, I had the opportunity to cast the tie-breaking vote in the United States Senate. (Applause.)\nAnd when President Donald Trump signs the bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, we will defund Planned Parenthood once and for all. (Applause.)\nAnd when it comes to those God-given liberties, there's one more thing this President has done. As a candidate for President, this President made a commitment to appoint strong conservatives to our federal courts and to the highest court in the land. He made a pledge, particularly when it came to Supreme Court, that he would nominate a jurist in the mold of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia. And he did just that when he nominated and we confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court on the United States of America. (Applause.)\nSo we've been busy, folks. But as the President likes to say, that's just what we call a good start. (Laughter.) Truth is, we got a lot of work to do, make no mistake about it. Before this summer, job one is we're going to work with this Congress -- the men and women in Republican majorities -- and we will repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nI bet I don't have to tell the Faith and Freedom Coalition members and supporters why this failed law has got to go. Just last month, our administration released a new study proving that Obamacare has made health insurance unaffordable for millions of Americans. In just four years -- get this -- Obamacare as more than doubled the average health insurance premiums on the individual markets. In some states, they're up nearly 200 percent.\nPresident Obama promised that Americans would save up to $2,500 on their premiums, but the average premium cost today is nearly $3,000 a year more for Americans than it was in 2013. And it's only going to get worse because premiums are spiking by double digits next year and the choices are plummeting. Obamacare is in a death spiral and more and more insurance companies are bailing on this failed law every single day.\nStates across America lost 83 insurers in 2017 alone. In fact, at this very moment, a third of American counties and five whole states only have one choice of insurance company under Obamacare, meaning they essentially have no choice. And come next year, tens of thousands of Americans or more won't have any insurance coverage at all.\nJust this week, more than 13,000 people in Ohio learned that they'll have no Obamacare coverage next year. In Missouri, 25 counties may be without Obamacare plans. And in Iowa, where I was just about a week ago, it looks like, very soon, 94 of the 99 counties could have no Obamacare to choose from, leaving tens of thousands of working families, small businesses, and family farmers without access to healthcare coverage they need.\nAnd folks, remember, it's not just the statistics. We're talking about real people in the midst of a real healthcare crisis. Good people, like Julie Champine, who I met with today in Wisconsin. I had the privilege to chat with her on my visit to Milwaukee. Julie's been buying health insurance for her family on the individual market since 2004. She's really a great lady to talk to -- great family, has worked hard in business, she and her husband together.\nBut Julie confided in me, she has some health issues. And health insurance is vitally important to her. Now Julie said she wanted to believe that when President Obama promised her that she could keep her plan, she could keep her doctor that it was true. But it just wasn't. Julie lost her family's health plan. She told me she lost her doctor. And ever since Julie's been forced to buy health insurance on the Obamacare exchange, and the simple truth is, as she told me today with emotion in her voice, she just -- she can't afford it.\nIn 2016 alone, Julie's Obamacare plan cost more than $9,000 in premiums with a deductible of $13,000. Late last year, she found out her premiums were going to go up by another $2,600 this year. Folks, Julie's Obamacare plan cost more than her mortgage and she can't even afford to use it. In fact, because of Obamacare, Julie told me that she actually chose, last Christmas, to stop paying for health insurance for three months just so she could afford Christmas presents for her kids and grandkids.\nFolks, that's just plain wrong. No American should ever have to choose between paying for their health insurance and providing for their families. It's heartbreaking. (Applause.) She basically said, under Obamacare, we have no hope. But I looked her in the eye, put my hand on her shoulder, and I said, Julie, help is on the way. (Applause.)\nYou know, the truth is, Julie is the face of Obamacare's failures but she is the face of tens of millions of Americans who are living proof that Obamacare is collapsing and taking the American people down with it. You know, you'd have to be blinded by partisanship to believe otherwise. And unfortunately, there's a lot of people who are blinded by partisanship. And you can find all of them in the Democrat minority in the House and Senate here in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\nI mean, look, they're the ones who gave us Obamacare, and now they won't lift a finger to help us rescue the American people from the mess they made. That's why we need this road to majority -- to keep the pressure on the Congress and help President Trump and Congress finish what we started. And I promise you, President Trump will not rest, will not relent until we rescue the American people from the disaster of Obamacare and give our country the world-class healthcare the American people deserve. (Applause.) That's a promise.\nAnd after we repeal and replace Obamacare, we're going to keep right on going. We're going to roll our sleeves up working with this Congress. Before the end of this year, we're going to pass the biggest tax cut since the days of Ronald Reagan. (Applause.) We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. This President is going to make the American tax code simpler, flatter, and fairer for everyone.\nYou know, there's an old joke about the tax code. They say it's 10 times the size of the Bible with none of the good news. (Laughter and applause.) Well, here's some real good news: We're going to put more money in taxpayers' pockets and give American families and American business the relief they need to grow. (Applause.)\nAnd we're not going to stop there. Under the President's leadership, we're going to continue to rein in wasteful government spending, restore fiscal responsibility to Washington, D.C., and with Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education, we're going to expand educational choices so every child in America has access to a world-class education regardless of their income, regardless of their area code. (Applause.)\nMost important of all, this President will continue to stand up for and stand with the brave men and women who protect our freedom and our way of life every day. (Applause.)\nNow, Karen and I are the proud parents of a lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. (Applause.) And as a parents of a member of our armed forces, I tell you what, I couldn't be more proud to serve with a President who is so committed to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States of America. President Trump is the best friend the Armed Forces of the United States will ever have. (Applause.)\nYou know, today, we received a heartbreaking reminder of the risks that our service men and women face in the defense of freedom. As I traveled to Wisconsin this afternoon, I was informed that three American soldiers were killed and one wounded in a terrible attack in Afghanistan. The Bible tells us that \"no greater love has a man than this, than he should lay down his life for his friends.\"\nLet me say from the heart, when heroes fall, Americans grieve. And tonight, our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these American heroes. We honor their service, their sacrifice, and we always will. (Applause.)\nWe honor them by remembering, but we also honor them by ensuring that those that they left behind in uniform have the resources and training to accomplish their mission. And I want to promise you, President Donald Trump will not rest and will not relent until we rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy, and once again give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the training they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. (Applause.)\nThe supplemental budget that Congress just put on the President's desk had the largest increase in military spending in the last 10 years. And the budget that the President submitted to the Congress for next year has the largest increase in defense spending since the administration of President Ronald Reagan. We're going to rebuild our military. (Applause.)\nAnd with that strong support, I would report to you our armed forces are in the fight. They're taking the fight to terrorists on our terms, on their soil. And ISIS is on the run. And under this Commander-in-Chief, we will hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source so that it can no longer threaten our people, our allies, or our very way of life. As the President said, this bloodshed must end -- this bloodshed will end. (Applause.)\nMen and women of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, President Donald Trump is a man of his word. And he's a man of action. And I promise you, whatever the national media is spending its time talking about on any given day -- (laughter) -- President Donald Trump will never stop fighting to make America safe again, to make America prosperous again. He will stay in the fight, and I know you will too.\nYou know, all of you have helped our President get this far, and I really just came tonight to say thanks, and to be here when you honored my friend. I want to thank you for everything you've done. But make no mistake about it, the harder work -- maybe the most important work -- is in front of us, not behind us. (Applause.)\nFrom this day forward, President Trump needs every ounce of your energy, your enthusiasm, your conviction, your time, your talent, and your treasure. But we also need, maybe, one other thing in these divided times. In these times of widening challenges at home and abroad, seemingly unknowable threats, and also a time of uncharacteristic division in America, I know you're the right people for me to encourage to do one more thing. And that is pray for America. (Applause.)\nAnd I'm not -- you know, on this one, I'm not so much talking about praying for a cause or praying for an issue. I'm always very moved by what President Abraham Lincoln said in his time when he was asked whether he believed that God was on the side of the Union Army. President Lincoln responded memorably. He said, rather than considering whether God is on our side, I think it's better for us to consider whether we are on God's side. So why don't we just pray for America, for all the people of America, and for the future of this great land. (Applause.)\nAnd when you pray, pray with confidence. Because I truly do believe that those ancient words, spoke millennia ago and enshrined in the hearts of every American. Words that have seen the people of this country through trials much greater than those that we face today. That if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, He'll do like He's always done in the long and storied history of this land. He'll hear from heaven, and He'll heal this land. This one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. (Applause.)\nThank you. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-06-10", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President to the Faith and Freedom Coalition"}
{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126353", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, first and foremost, would you join me again in thanking our host Bob Hillis and Direct Supply for having this conversation and hosting us today? (Applause.)\nThank you very much. It is an honor to be with you. Great to be back in Wisconsin. And quite honestly with all of my Hoosier biases notwithstanding, I will just tell you, you have like one of the greatest governors in the history of this country in Scott Walker. I truly believe it. (Applause.) I truly believe it.\nIf we weren't such good friends, I would still say that. And, Governor, I'm grateful for your leadership on healthcare. And in so many areas, Wisconsin really sets the pace for the country. And I'm grateful that you would take time to be with us today.\nThank you all for taking time on a beautiful Saturday afternoon to come in. I'm also very appreciative of being joined by two members of Congress. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner I had the privilege of serving with for 12 years, one of the great, great conservative voices on Capitol Hill. (Applause.) And Representative Glenn Grothman, who is a great, great friend and a great champion for Wisconsin in Washington, D.C. Glenn, good to see you.\nI'm here today really to listen more than to talk, and we're grateful for members of the media to be here to have the opportunity to hear from all of you. They'll hear from all of you. They'll hear from us in a little bit as we make some formal remarks later.\nBut as I've traveled the country on behalf of the President talking about healthcare, we've been taking the opportunity to listen to families that have been impacted by the failed policies of Obamacare. But the business leaders gathered around this table have your own story to tell. I've heard it around the country.\nAnd here in Wisconsin, I don't really need to tell you about the failure that is Obamacare. In Wisconsin, we've been in a recent study -- issued by the administration, we've seen that premiums in this state have nearly doubled since 2013.\nEverybody remembers when Obamacare was passed that we heard if you like your doctor, you can keep it. If you like your health insurance, you can keep it. And, Jim, you remember those promises. Chief among them was that the cost of health insurance would go down. Every single one of those promises have been broken. And here in Wisconsin, a 93 percent increase in premiums.\nAnd in some states around the country it's been twice that. It really is extraordinary. President Obama actually promised that you'd save up to $2,500 in annual premiums. The average cost of premiums now is $3,000 or more for families in this state. Insurance providers are pulling out of Obamacare left and right. One-third of the counties in this country have only one insurer available for purchase in the individual market. And next year tens of thousands of Americans will have no Obamacare coverage available at all.\nSo we'll talk about solutions here in a little bit. But I'm very anxious with members of the media and others gathered listening on, I'd like to have you slip your hand in the air and answer the question: How has Obamacare impacted you, your business, your employees? And if you can share a couple of minutes, I'd really, really be grateful to hear from you.\nAlso just share with who you are and your business. And the first person ready to talk. Mary, you ready to go?\nA PARTICIPANT: I'm ready. I'm Mary Springer (ph). My brother and I, Steve Wyberg (ph) -- we own and operate a business in Waukesha called Thermtec (ph). We currently employ 117 people. A few years ago we were up to about 165. Some of that is due to this -- the general downturn of the economy, and some of it is partially due to healthcare and us not wanting to expand our payroll because we can't afford to expand our payroll.\nOur health insurance costs per employee have gone up 100 percent --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Since Obamacare?\nA PARTICIPANT: Correct, since 2013. So we're typical I think of many employers. We have opportunity to expand, but finding good people and wanting to insure them makes us pause.\nOne thing on our minds about the cost of insurance is how is the government -- if they're going to continue to be involved in insuring, how do we do that when only 50 percent of us pay taxes? How is that ever going to work? Because the pool of money coming in is just never going to be great enough to support the ever-expanding cost of healthcare.\nAnd furthermore, the Republican Party -- I know Obama promised to have costs go down. That's totally unrealistic given the advances made in medicine today. We have an employee who was getting a treatment for Hep C that costs $22,000 per dose. And you needed six doses in order to be cured. So those are wonderful advances, and everybody wants to take advantage of them. But when we only have half of the country paying anything into the tax system, and costs go up like they do, how are we going to guarantee -- as the Republican Party to say they can lower the cost. I think we have to be cautious and maybe say, we can reduce the amount of the increase. When we're getting double-digit increases every year, maybe the wiser strategy would say, let's bring it down to single-digit increases.\nBut if we say there won't be increases, we're going to lose.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, so much, Mary.\nA PARTICIPANT: Hi, my name is Sri Vasudevan. I'm chairman of the Republican Party of Ozaukee County. But I'm a physician by background. And for 40 years I've practiced in rehabilitation medicine and mostly taking care of people with pains. So my practice was pain rehabilitation. And I ran multi-discipline pain programs at four different facilities, including a medical college and for the communities here.\nThe way it directly affected me, if you mean, is that the benefits have substantially decreased. Even though more people got insurance, they got insurance for going to emergency room visits. But for taking care of issues like chronic pain, which requires physical therapy, psychological treatment, and some medications, which are excellent for it, those are not covered by most insurance companies. And especially Obamacare did not cover that. And so people then resorted to opioids.\nThat led to many of the opioid problems, which I identified. I wrote about it in 2010 before the so-called crisis began. And it continues to be such a problem. The last three years of my practice, basically I couldn't see anyone who needed to be seen. They needed a program. But we hook or crook, we tried to find a little bit of care for them, eventually forcing me to retire last year after 40 years.\nSo if you come up with a new plan, I may go back into practice again. But for now, I'm serving the Governor. And I served on the medical examining board, on his appointment, and on the injured patient compensation board, which I serve right now.\nBut most importantly, the second thing I want to point out is our Governor has been very good in creating Medicaid for all and not taking the Obamacare -- and it still worked. And it's not helped the pain field, but people with chronic pain don't get the care and services they should. And in my opinion, that is so important if you want to ever decrease the opioid crisis in this country.\nAnd I thank you very much.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Doctor, thank you. And I just really appreciate the Governor's focus and your focus --\nA PARTICIPANT: Thank you very much.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: -- on the opioid crisis in Wisconsin which is impacting families across.\nA PARTICIPANT: Yes, Chris Hanson (ph). I'm a small-business owner in the Fox Cities and Appleton, and I am involved in health insurance. I actually work in three different markets. I work in small business -- so I have over 100 small-business clients. So I'm kind of your boots on the, per se. I am in the weeds. I live there.\nI also deal in the individual market, the under 65. So I'm certified on the marketplace, and I deal with Medicare.\nSo what I've seen -- I also, as a little background beyond that is I worked in healthcare delivery for most my career before that. So I have seen two sides -- both the delivery and the health insurance.\nHealth insurance is very different than healthcare delivery. Healthcare delivery is on the forefront, health insurance is always behind trying to catch up on how do we cover those services. So they're always far behind in that.\nI also sat on the HIRSP board when it was here in Wisconsin, and we had a -- the high-risk pool. We had a very good program. We could be the poster child for the rest of the United States when it comes to how can you take what the federal government is doing today, bring it back to the states. It ran very, very efficiently here.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And that was done away with?\nA PARTICIPANT: Yes, in 2014, that expired when Obamacare came into business.\nWhat I see -- a couple of things that have impacted small business is those employers that have less than 50 employees, when this came into an action in 2014, they all -- and there might be some that say yes -- we're not going to expand. We're not going to get over 50 employees, then we don't have to offer health insurance.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: How many people have heard that?\nA PARTICIPANT: Everyone. So where was the incentive to expand, grow businesses? I don't want to offer benefits. I don't want to be forced to, therefore I won't.\nAnd even those in companies over 50 employees, when they really looked pay-or-play -- pay the penalty or actually offer benefits, cheaper to just pay the penalty. So again, you've dis-incentivized business for expansion.\nAlso when it comes to small business, 75 percent -- I noticed in my own block of businesses I work with, and it's been confirmed by the commissioner's office in Wisconsin that 75 percent of all small businesses that have health insurance are still pre-ACA, pre-the Affordable Care Act, meaning at the 11th hour, if you like your plan, you can keep it. Yes, they did. All the insurance companies said, well, we will transition you. We will grandfather you in so that they were able to keep their pre-ACA plans. If those small businesses are forced -- and at least at this point, transitional relief goes to the end of 2018, if that continues indefinitely that would be good for small business because otherwise, if they are forced to be rolling into the Affordable Care Act, their premium increases will be anywhere from 20 percent to 40 percent, if not more.\nSo that's what I see in the small business.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you so much -- the impact of Obamacare -- your business.\nA PARTICIPANT: For me, I'm a financial planner, and I work with a lot of people. Personally on my own, my premiums have gone up over 80 percent -- 48 percent last year.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Since 2013?\nA PARTICIPANT: Since 2014. I got cancelled midway. The amount of my deductible went from $2,700 to -- we both pay $6,500 apiece.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Deductible?\nA PARTICIPANT: Just the deductible. And right now here if I break a leg, I have no coverage. I can only get coverage in my little HMO market up there. I can't go see my son without worrying that if I get hurt, I have to fly back with a broken arm or broken leg if I'm helping him on something.\nJust there's no coverage for us. We have to stay in our little corner of the world to be covered.\nI work with a lot of people who are looking at retiring. The very first thing I ask -- and they want to retire before 65 -- is have you looked into your health insurance? Do you understand what the premiums are? Most of them have had group insurance through their employer. The second they see what the premiums are, I have them go on the website to figure it out, they're like, we can't retire. They just cannot. There's no way to pay for it.\nIt's either they have enough money that they can pay for it, or they're so -- they don't have enough, and we try to use games to make their income low, so they can get subsidized. And they have to stay that way until they're 65. It's really, really tough for them to retire these days.\nA lot of them are just deciding that they have to work longer.\nA PARTICIPANT: And our premiums since 2013 -- well, beginning of '14, our premiums have went up -- how much, just for the two of us? You have the number.\nA PARTICIPANT: I said it was 80 percent. We paid a little less than $10,000 for the two of us, and that included our HSA contribution. Now with our HSA contribution, we're going to spend $21,000 this year.\nAn associate of mine, he was going to retire at 61 --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And that's a direct result of Obamacare?\nA PARTICIPANT: Oh, 100 percent, 100 percent.\nAnd he was going to retire at 61, but his premiums came in with his HSA contribution at $29,000. He is now going to have to work until 65. His wife had quit her job at the hospital, and she had had the health benefits all along. They can't retire. So they have to continue working.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And you're talking about your premiums -- and I share this with people that are looking on -- your premiums went from $10,000 to $21,000, right? And yet not only did that double your cost, but your deductible went from $2,700 to $6,500 -- each.\nA PARTICIPANT: Each.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: This is the story you hear about Obamacare everywhere across the country is that premiums have doubled, in some cases in some states have gone up by 200 percent. And at the same time the coverage that you have to pay that exorbitant price for now has such a high deductible that it's essentially impractical for people to take advantage -- making a choice that you said they're making simply to opt out of the system and pay the fine (inaudible).\nA PARTICIPANT: Well, thank you very much for having me. It's an honor to be here. Governor Walker toured Monarch (ph), a few years back, and we had the honor of having him there. So thank you very much for touring us.\nI'm currently president of Ector Technologies (ph), which is just down the road. But my experience with Obamacare started at Monarch Corporation, which I ran for 15 years, so I saw the transition pre-Obamacare or pre-ACA and heading into ACA.\nAnd our rates actually went up over 80 percent, and it wasn't 100 percent only because we moved carriers in order to keep those costs down.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Just to stay on our language here. The premiums went up --\nA PARTICIPANT: Well, our premiums for our employees, we were between 50 to 100 employees -- went up 80 percent between 2013 and 2016.\nNow the reason it didn't double is because we changed providers in there several times in order to keep the cost down. But we also had to go from plans that were $2,500 deductible to $7,500 deductible plans.\nNow, keep in mind we were tied to mining at that time, so we couldn't give guys raises. We couldn't give individuals bonuses. And I wasn't raising or bonusing myself either. But to have their rates go up like that, and then to have the deductibles go up by triple, they can't afford it. They just literally can't afford it.\nSo we literally had guys opting out of insurance altogether because it didn't make sense to them.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I want to be sensitive to everybody's time. Bob?\nA PARTICIPANT: Well, I want to talk about the other side of the coin, which is the America Health Care Act that just passed the House.\nDirect Supply serves over 3 million seniors and 1 million of those are on Medicaid. And the American Health Care Act did an excellent job of taking care of the disabled and the elderly that are an average age of 87 years old who have nowhere else to turn. And I want to congratulate Governor Walker and Speaker Ryan and your, Mr. Vice President, on the fact that you helped defend the people who really need help most of all under Medicaid.\nAnd the American Health Care Act preserves that, and it's very important to our company and our partners.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Well, let me just say to the others who are here, I know I can speak for the Governor and I can speak for the two congressmen who are here that just very grateful for your testimonials about this. They were powerful and eloquent, and I think are going to be very helpful.\nThank you also for -- and I want to give a lion's share of credit to Wisconsin's Paul Ryan and to these great congressmen that the no good deed goes unpunished in Washington, D.C. (Laughter.) But I think as time goes on -- and I thought, Mary, this was reflected as you look at what Speaker Ryan and these legislators moved out of the House, it was precisely a stair-step approach. And it represents I think meaningful progress in rescuing the country from Obamacare and heading us on a path of being able to tackle exactly those issues that the both of you raise, and all of you did.\nBut, Bob, thank you. So thank you for that shout out.", "timestamp": "2017-06-10", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at a Listening Session with Small-Business Owners in Milwaukee, Wisconsin"}

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126318", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:39 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. As you've all by now probably heard, the President is placing a big emphasis on workforce development. Secretary of Labor Acosta and Secretary of Education DeVos, along with the President's daughter, Ivanka, and Reed Cordish from the Office of American Innovation, have been deeply involved in this effort. And Secretary Acosta had the opportunity to address this issue just a few moments ago at the President's first meeting with his fully confirmed Cabinet.\nSo I'd like to kick it off by having Secretary Acosta come up, talk to you a little bit about this initiative, and take a few questions.\nWith that, Secretary Acosta.\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Thank you, and good afternoon. I especially want to thank the work that's been done by Ivanka Trump and the Office of American Innovation to develop the proposals that we'll be talking about this week. I'll be traveling with her tomorrow to Wisconsin where we'll be looking at some excellent programs. Her leadership on this issue has been invaluable.\nAs you know by now, the President will be making an important announcement regarding apprenticeships this week. He'll be visiting the Department of Labor on Wednesday.\nThere are currently 6 million job openings in the United States -- vacant jobs that can be filled. This is the highest number of job vacancies ever. A Business Roundtable survey released just last week found that 95 percent of executives reported problems finding qualified workers. Americans want to work. American companies want to hire. The issue is a mismatch between available jobs and prospective employees' job skills.\nThis skills gap is a particular challenge in some of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy -- healthcare and information technology. And it also persists in some of the more traditional sectors of the economy. There are currently 360,000 job vacancies in manufacturing. There are 200,000 job vacancies in construction. And with the upcoming plans for infrastructure, those job vacancies in construction are only going to increase.\nApprenticeships teach skills needed to bridge this skills gap. An apprenticeship combines a paid work component with an educational component. Apprentices earn while they learn, and in the process they largely avoid the substantial student debt that you see with higher education today.\nThe most obvious benefit of apprenticeships is a good job. Individuals who complete apprenticeship programs have an average starting salary of about $60,000 a year. Nine out of ten are employed upon completion of the programs. Both the starting salary and the employment rate are higher than that of traditional college graduates.\nApprenticeships are also going to increase to labor productivity. Apprentices hit the ground running. When they start a job, they're more able, more productive, and tend to be more loyal to the employer. Despite these benefits, apprenticeships make only about 3 percent of the American workforce. This administration will expand apprentices across most, if not all, industries.\nHigher education, too, should assume responsibility for promoting apprenticeships. Community colleges and four-year colleges have an obligation to work with students to educate them in skills they need to succeed. Demand-driven, experience-based education is not new. It's used to some extent in the healthcare sector. Demand-driven, experience-based education can be improved and it can be used in a wide variety of sectors to further expand the workforce. Incorporating apprenticeships into two- and four-year degree programs would offer students both traditional learning and skills-based learning.\nAnd this is particularly important for those students who learn better by doing. President Trump has seen firsthand the success of apprenticeship programs in the building trades where he's very familiar. The building trades invest nearly a billion a year of private money into the apprenticeship program. President Trump has made clear his commitment to expand job opportunities here in America. Apprenticeships is one very important way that President Trump will fulfill that promise.\nAnd again, I'm very excited to work with Ivanka Trump and Reed Cordish in the Office of American Innovation as this program goes forward.\nQuestions. Yes.\nQ: How exactly do you plan to expand these apprenticeships? What is the government going to do? I guess it's our understanding that it's not necessarily -- you're not going to put more money towards these programs. So how are these apprenticeships going to expand?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: So if you look into building trades, there's almost a billion that's spent every year, and that's all private sector money. The building trades have put together labor management organizations that jointly invest in these apprenticeship programs because they know both on the labor side and the management side that a skilled workforce is critical to the building trades. And that's how it's worked for a number of years.\nI've talked to several CEOs, Ivanka Trump has spoken to several CEOs, and there's excitement in the business sector. The private-private partnership where businesses come together with educational institutions to actually focus on demand-driven education, to focus education on the skills that business is demanding has worked in other sectors and can work throughout the economy.\nQ: The question is, where exactly do you see these apprenticeships? Because most of the complaints against it is that it's for low-paying jobs and not the higher-education jobs that you need, and that it amounts to nothing more than indentured servitude.\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: So that's just factually wrong. If you look at Department of Labor data, the average starting salary for an apprentice is $60,000 a year. And that's higher than a college graduate.\nI was out in Michigan at the port facility and I met with some of the apprentices at the port facility, and they love it.\nQ: But they (inaudible), correct?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: They love it -- let me finish -- they love it, they are excited about it. And they are being paid a very, very good wage. I should add, though, that you see apprenticeships in white-collar positions as well. There are a number of firms that we're talking to that are looking at it for areas like bookkeeping, accounting.\nIf you look at law schools, for example, there's been conversations even in law schools about the need for more experience-based education. The Carnegie Commission came out with a report a number of years ago about the importance of experience-based education and law.\nSo the point I'm making is we need to stop thinking that this is limited to a certain kind of the job sector. Experience-based education works throughout all sectors of the economy.\nQ: Just a quick follow-up, if I may -- just a quick follow-up.\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: One follow-up.\nQ: But is your program geared towards the white-collar jobs, or to mostly --\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Our program will be geared to all industries and all jobs. The point here is to foster private-private partnerships between industry and educational institutions so that when students go to a community college, or when students are looking at apprenticeship programs in the building trades or in four-year institutions -- when they leave, they have the skills necessary to enter the workforce.\nQ: In the President's budget it talks about work requirements. Also, Congress is talking about some new welfare reform for able-bodied people. Could this sort of integrate into that at all?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Well, certainly one of the important aspects of this is the portability of credentials. When someone learns a skill, it's important to signal to other employers that this person knows a certain set of skills. And so, I should say, the emphasis is on high-quality apprenticeships because it's important to not water things down, and it's important to have skills that are portable and that are indicative of quality.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: In terms of the overall focus on workforce development, the President's budget contains about 40-percent cut in all workforce skills programs from the last budget. If workforce development is a priority, why is the President calling for that? And secondly, my understanding is the budget has about $90 million for apprenticeship programs, which is also what President Obama had requested. How is this expanding what the last administration wanted to do?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: So let me circle back to the point I made about private-private partnerships and what the building trades do. The building trades invest a billion dollars a year of private money to develop a skilled workforce. And so I want to challenge the assumption that the only way to move policy is to increase government spending. What we're trying to measure here is outcomes, right?\nSo private-to-private partnerships -- if industry is, in the building trades, willing to work with labor to foster these programs, that's exactly -- isn't that exactly what we want to see? And so we should measure success based on outcomes and not based simply on spending.\nQ: So do you foster these private-to-private relationships? Is there some executive action that will be taken? Is there a tax policy proposal? How exactly are you proposing that this would happen? Because it hasn't, I guess, organically happened beyond what already exists.\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: I will answer in two parts. First, you've already seen that to a large extent as we've had roundtables with business leaders, as Ivanka Trump has conducted several meetings with CEOs around the country here at the White House.\nAnd the second part to your answer is, stay tuned and listen to the Wednesday announcement.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Is there a certain region or a group of people you're trying to focus in on with these apprenticeships, especially since, even as the President is saying that the unemployment rate is doing well under his administration, there are still groups of people, be it by region or be it by race, or be it by gender, that still have issues when it comes to employment? Is there a focus on certain groups, certain regions, certain genders?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: So, ma'am, you are correct. So the unemployment rate, I believe, is 4.3 percent. The broader unemployment rate, that is the U6 rate, I believe is now at 8.4 percent. And as we've had discussions with CEOs that are looking at these apprenticeship programs, one of the items of discussion is a way to work with communities that you typically don't see going into the STEM fields and other fields.\nAnd part of that discussion has been, how do you target those groups, how do you reach out. And it's interesting, because apprenticeships help here because apprenticeships bring students together in a cohort model with individuals who are currently working in their field. And so it allows the possibility of role-modeling. An apprentice can have a role model that can provide support and can introduce them to the field.\nAnd so I actually think this is going to be a great thing for expending opportunities, for example, to women in STEM.\nQ: One follow-up on that. So with that -- and you're saying women in STEM, but there are still women who -- and going down to race -- the African American and Hispanic unemployment numbers, particularly in STEM. Is this administration looking to push, also, apprenticeships for those communities, as well, for the private-to-private partnerships?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: We're looking to push apprenticeships across the board -- all people, all industries. This is an opportunity for everyone.\nQ: You mentioned that you're targeting this towards all sorts of professions, not just blue-collar professions. How do you get around -- in many states, there are laws that would prevent this sort of thing, such as the in the legal profession, where most states, I believe, don't allow people to do things like read for the Bar anymore. How do you get around regulations and state laws?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: So let me circle back and clarify. The question was, is this just targeted -- earlier -- to blue collars? And then I said, no. In fact, it's across the board. And I gave an example where experience-based education has been advocated. And I want to be clear: The vast majority of apprenticeships are not for law, okay? Let's start there. So the question about state barriers I really think is a non-issue because the vast majority of apprenticeships are going to be in the types of professions where students are starting out -- entry professions, professions that you typically see coming out of community college, professions that you typically see at most large state, four-year institutions. And for those professions you don't have those types of barriers.\nRight behind you. Sir.\nQ: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Given the advantages of apprentice programs, what are the CEOs telling you about why they aren't used much more often?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: So I don't want to speak for the CEOs, because they haven't told me why they're not used more often. What I can tell you is that every CEO that I have spoken with has made a personal commitment to pursuing these. The CEOs are excited. I attended a business roundtable event around this. And to a person, the CEOs are looking forward to it because the CEOs need these skilled workforce. And they recognize Americans want to work; we just need to marry up the desire to work with the workforce skills.\nIn the back. Yes, sir.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. You're one of the newcomers at the administration here. I believe maybe this is the first time we've heard from you on camera. So I'm wondering if you could give us more of a broad reading of how you see the labor market currently, eventually. The unemployment rate is at 4.3 percent, and you brought up the U6. But I'm wondering if you could give us your read on what some of the bright spots are with the job market right now, and what some of the challenges are as you see it.\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: So the bright spots are obvious. We've had almost 600,000 new jobs so far, this calendar year. The 4.3 percent unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in 16 years, since 2001. The number of job vacancies in a sense points to the skills gap, but it's really a phenomenal number that's quite positive -- 6 million job vacancies. It means that if we can fix the skills gap, there are 6 million jobs that we can fill right now. And if you compare that to 6.9 million individuals that are unemployed -- and wow.\nI think one of the -- to fully answer your question, one of the challenges that we need to look at is the labor force participation. There are a number of Americans that are forgotten, that have been ignored, and that have dropped out of the workforce. Labor force participation is lower than it should be. And our hope, and Ivanka Trump's hope, and this administration's hope -- and certainly President Trump just this morning referenced these individuals who are forgotten, because they're the ones that elected him -- through this apprenticeship program, we're hoping to bring them back into the labor force. Because to have growth, we need that labor force growth.\nQ: And you would admit that this is just a small part of bringing the labor force participation rate up? What else do you think needs to happen? Is it tax reform? Is it -- what else needs to happen?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: All of the above, right? This is a small but very, very significant part, because if you start providing -- if you starting changing the system to demands-driven education, where educational institutions -- whether they be two- or four-year colleges, or experience-based educational institutions -- are providing workforce skills, with each passing year, for every hundreds of thousands of folks that go through this, those are all new jobs. But certainly, all the policies that you see this administration administering, whether it be tax reform or other, is part of bringing individuals back into the workforce.\nMa'am.\nQ: Yes. When we would see results? When would the skills gap close? And what types of jobs are we talking about exactly, versus professions?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: So, one, I think it's a very speculative question. I can't provide you an exact date.\nAnd the second question was? I'm sorry.\nQ: The types of jobs.\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Again, what types of jobs -- I think we're looking to apply this broadly across all industries. You know, it's interesting, because as some of you know, I was at a university, and I know a student that really wanted to be a police officer, and so that student majored in criminal justice. And when he graduated, he probably had student debt but he didn't have a job, because criminal justice doesn't prepare you to be a police officer.\nSo what would things be like if, actually, a criminal justice degree allowed students that wanted to, to have the option of also attending a police academy? And I want to give that as a specific example of what these possibilities would be. What would a legal studies degree be like if you could actually also get paralegal or legal assistance training? There are possibilities all across that we can look at.\nMa'am.\nQ: Two things, so bear with me. There is an idea out there, for at least one big city, to require students graduating high school to have either a letter saying they're going to college, the military, or entering a trade school, which would lead to these kinds of jobs. I'm wondering what you think of that.\nAnd my second part of that is: To really help us understand what the White House is doing with these meetings with the CEOs, is anything being reduced to a memo of understanding or a letter, so we actually get the pledge? Because I want to have more of a sense of what the \"is\" is out there. Nice meetings are nice, but what is the promise that you could say that people are telling you? And how are you codifying it so you have it written down so you can go back to the CEO and say, \"You say you're going to do it and you did it\"? So could you explain how you're -- what can be --\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Happy to answer both. First, what do we think about requirements that every student have a letter saying what they're going to -- I'll speak just for myself on this one. I worry about a requirement that requires students to do A, B or C. I think our nation is about choosing, and I think you need to respect individuals' choices. And you certainly encourage; you can say, what are you going to do with yourself, what do you want to do? But I always worry when I hear the word \"requirement,\" because I think we're about choice.\nGoing to your second point, I'll say in part, stay tuned for the Wednesday announcement as to what specifically we're going to be doing. And I would say after that Wednesday announcement you can certainly expect quick and vigorous follow-up with the various CEOs and industry associations with which the administration has been speaking, because at least for myself the expectation would be, \"Okay, you said you're very interested in this; let's sit down and let's pen something out, and let's see how we can go forward.\"\nOne last question. Ma'am.\nQ: Can I get you to clarify your answer to Julie's question about the budget? Because there's so much confusion about this. When you're saying the President is interested in outcomes -- and you come from an academic environment -- is the President saying that the Labor Department has evaluated all the existing programs before recommending cutting grants or workplace support for young people, seniors, agriculture, adults who have been displaced? Are you saying you've evaluated all those programs in recommending that they be cut because they're not working, or because the President merely does not want to spend the money?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: So, as you pointed out, I come from an academic setting, so let me try to answer that question by analogy. It used to be that the question of whether a university is doing well was a function of how much the university spent. And, in Florida, you're now seeing questions like, \"what is your graduation rate?\", \"how many students that are graduating are holding jobs?\" And so you're seeing a focus on outcome as opposed to spending.\nAnd the point that I was trying to make, and I'll reiterate, is that we tend in Washington to simply say, how much more money can we spend on something, rather than let's think outside the box and try to solve a problem. And I think we owe it to the American taxpayer that is ultimately footing this bill to focus less on how much we spend, and more on whether, in fact, the problems are being solved.\nSo thank you very much.\nMR. SPICER: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. I appreciate you coming by today.\nAs we get back to what's going on today, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the three servicemembers that were killed this weekend in Afghanistan. The injury -- excuse me, the incident is currently under investigation. But our thoughts and our prayers are with the families of these American heroes who lost their lives in this tragic event.\nAs the Secretary said, it's Workforce Week here at the White House, so that's going to be a major emphasis for the administration. But we're also moving ahead on another -- on several other items on the President's domestic and foreign policy agenda.\nToday, the Department of Agriculture released guidance for American beef producers who are preparing to ship U.S. beef to Chinese markets for the first time since 2003. As we announced last month, as part of the U.S.-China 100-Day Action Plan that followed up the President's meeting with President Xi, China agreed to reopen this $2.5 billion market to American ranchers and cattle producers.\nBefore the market was closed, the U.S. was China's largest supplier of beef, providing 70 percent of its imports. The actions by the U.S. Department of Agriculture today are an important first step in the process of re-opening this lucrative market to American businesses.\nTomorrow, the Vice President will be speaking at the Department of Health and Human Services about the continuing death spiral of Obamacare and why we need to keep our promise to the American people and repeal and replace it with a patient-centric alternative as soon as possible.\nThis weekend, the President Vice President was in Wisconsin -- the President will be there tomorrow -- where he met with the everyday Americans who have lost their plans, their doctors, and a lot of their hope for this failing law. As the Vice President said on Saturday, President Trump will never stop fighting for those families who are facing impossible choices every day as their premiums and deductibles continue to skyrocket. He won't rest until we have fixed this.\nThe President's tax reform team is also continuing to hold meetings and discussions both at the principal level and the staff level as we work towards a consensus plan that will deliver middle-class and tax simplification for everyone.\nSecretary Mnuchin of the Treasury and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn continue to listen to members of Congress from both sides of the aisle. And Director Cohn will lead a listening session on tax reform with auto industry leaders later this week. These meetings have been incredibly productive, and we believe that tax reform is well on track for the President to sign later this year.\nTogether, the three pillars of infrastructure, tax reform, and repeal and replace of Obamacare are key to reaching the President's goal of a booming and vibrant American economy, and the administration is going to continue to work every day to turn the President's promises into policies.\nLooking ahead, on Friday, the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis will meet here. The meeting will be open to the public through a livestream on WhiteHouse.gov.\nI am also pleased to announce that President Trump will welcome Indian Prime Minister Modi to the White House on June 26th. He looks forward to discussing the ways to strengthen our ties between the United States and India and advancing our common priorities -- fighting terrorism, promoting economic growth and reforms, and expanding security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. The two leaders will look to outline a common vision for the U.S.-India partnership that's worthy of India's 1.6 billion citizens.\nAnd before I take your questions, I want to wish the 41st President, George Herbert Walker Bush, a happy 93rd birthday from all of us at the White House. I hope he has a fantastic day in celebration.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions.\nLalit.\nQ: Thank you. Following up on your India announcement, the President, in his speech to the Indian-American (inaudible) in New Jersey had said if he's elected he would be the best friend of India ever in the White House. What steps does the President want to take in his next four years, or eight years, to implement his promise he made to the community here?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I know -- and we've read these out a few times -- but the President and the Prime Minister have had a number of positive phone conversations and expect to further that discussion when they meet in person on June 26th, as I mentioned just a moment ago, whether it's economic growth and reforms, fighting terrorism, expanding our cooperation as major defense partners.\nU.S.-India trade has grown six-fold since 2000, from $19 billion to $115 billion in 2016. And the Indian economy is growing at over 7 percent. U.S. energy and technologies, including natural gas, are helping to build Prime Minister Modi's vision for a new India and creating thousands of U.S. jobs in the process.\nI think you can expect the two of them to set forth a vision that will expand the U.S.-India partnership in an ambitious and worthy way of both countries' people.\nJessica.\nQ: Sean, thank you. Two questions on trade. Number one, you talked about the beef arrangement. Is that beginning today? And can you flesh out a little bit more about what it looks like? I understood there was going to be an announcement from USDA. Are we waiting for that to actually make this is a fact? Or where are we in the process?\nMR. SPICER: The U.S. Department of Agriculture will have many more details on the process moving forward, but the announcement is coming from them today.\nQ: The shipment leaves today?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think the announcement is coming today.\nQ: And secondly, my other quick question is on steel and aluminum, and the review that the administration is doing. The President said -- and was quoted in one of the pool reports as saying that there is legislation being drafted on antidumping. The 232 process goes to Congress anyway. Was he referring to additional legislation, or this 232 review that you had already initiated as reported by Secretary Ross?\nMR. SPICER: So Secretary Ross should have a further update on the review -- the 232 review later this week, I believe. When that comes out, there are certain recommendations that will be made to Congress to address antidumping provisions in the steel and aluminum and other markets -- so when that comes out. But I think there will be recommendations to Congress to follow up on on how to rectify some of the problems.\nTrey.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. A couple questions for you. First, does President Trump have audio recordings of his conversations and meetings with the former FBI Director, James Comey?\nMR. SPICER: The President made clear in the Rose Garden last week that he would have an announcement shortly.\nQ: Do you have any sort of timeline on when that announcement will be?\nMR. SPICER: When the President is ready to make it.\nQ: And a quick follow-up on the Attorney General. From the perspective of President Trump, what role did Attorney General Jeff Sessions play in the firing of James Comey?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to discuss private conversations between the President and the Attorney General.\nQ: Sean, to that end, when Jeff Sessions testifies tomorrow, do you believe that he should invoke executive privilege on conversations between himself and the President as it relates to Jim Comey?\nMR. SPICER: I think it depends on the scope of the questions. To get into a hypothetical at this point would be premature.\nQ: In any way, did Jeff Sessions, folks at the DOJ ask for the White House's permission, in essence, for him to testify publicly tomorrow?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know the answer to that question. I know Congress, generally speaking, sets whether a hearing is open or closed based on the sensitivity of the subject.\nQ: Is the President okay with him testifying in this open setting tomorrow?\nMR. SPICER: I think he's going to testify. We're aware of it and we'll go from there.\nJohn.\nQ: But just to follow on that, the President seemed to indicate that he thought that it was a mistake for Jeff Sessions to recuse himself in the Russia investigation. He said that his preference would have been to the contrary, off-camera. What does the President think about the fact that Sessions will be testifying tomorrow and, according to the Department of Justice, wanted to testify in an open session rather than closed classified session?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President has been clear, last week in the Rose Garden, that he believes that the sooner we can get this addressed and dealt with -- that there's been no collusion -- he wants this to get investigated as soon as possible and be done with it so he can continue with the business of the American people.\nQ: If I could ask you about the other headline of the day -- the State of Maryland, the District of Columbia filing a lawsuit against the President, seeking rulings on two points in the emoluments clause in the Constitution. The RNC thinks that this is a bogus lawsuit. What is the President and what is the White House's perspective on that?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President's interest, as previously discussed, do not violate the emoluments clause for reasons, at length, that the Department of Justice filing enumerate in their Friday night filing, with respect to the CREW lawsuit -- it was just the first one. This lawsuit today is just another iteration of the case that was filed by that group, CREW -- filed actually by the same lawyers. So it's not hard to conclude that partisan politics may be one of the motivations behind the seat.\nThe suit was filed by two Democratic attorney generals. The lawyers driving the suit are an advocacy group with partisan ties. It actually started with a press conference as opposed to filing it, which is interesting. And the suit challenges the sort of business transaction that everyone from Penny Pritzker, who served in the last administration, and others have engaged in while in office. So I think we'll continue to move to dismiss this case in the normal course of business.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I wanted to just -- two questions. But first, why leave open this question of whether there are tapes? Don't the American people -- do they deserve to know whether Comey was lying to the Senate? Why leave this question open?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President made it clear what his intention is on Friday.\nQ: But is -- I mean, it's an open question that --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that, and he said he would answer that question in due time.\nQ: Okay, but to follow up on -- speaking of lawsuits, for the Ninth Circuit -- they just came out and they upheld the block of the travel ban. Any response to that?\nMR. SPICER: We're currently reviewing that opinion. I think we can all attest that these are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the United States and committing acts of bloodshed and violence. We continue to be confident that the President's executive order to protect this country is fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the Supreme Court.\nQ: Hey, Sean. So two questions for you then. I want to follow up on the tapes issue. If the President does have evidence that the FBI Director lied under oath, what is he waiting for?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President made it very clear on Friday that he would get back as soon as possible on this, and his position on that conversation.\nQ: Right, but so what is he waiting for? What's the delay?\nMR. SPICER: He's not waiting for anything. When he's ready to further discuss it, he will. But I think he laid out his position very clearly, very concisely on Friday.\nOlivier.\nQ: On the travel ban, Sean -- this is the second question -- you just mentioned you obviously responded to the Ninth Circuit ruling today. That ruling also cites the President's tweets from June 5th on the travel ban. And it cites your statements -- this administration's statement that the President's tweets are official statements. So given that measure, given that the travel ban is obviously a priority for the President, how is it that the President is not putting his own agenda in danger when it comes to his Twitter habits?\nMR. SPICER: I think the bottom line is, as I just noted -- I mean, cases should be decided on the rule of law and on that. And when you look at what the law is and the U.S. code that allows the President to do whatever he needs to, that's what we were deciding on. And frankly, I think any lawyer worth their salt 100 percent agrees that the President is fully within his rights and his responsibilities to do what is necessary to protect the country.\nOlivier.\nQ: The Twitter question, Sean -- it's a different question, though.\nMR. SPICER: Olivier.\nQ: It comes to the Twitter issue. So I just want to --\nMR. SPICER: Olivier. Thank you.\nQ: Sean, what is the President's reaction to the Russian government's crackdown on anti-corruption protests today?\nMR. SPICER: Are you speaking in general or with respect to --\nQ: Well, Mr. Navalny in particular, but I assume that would be part of your overall --\nMR. SPICER: No, I just wanted to be clear we're talking about the same thing. I think the United States strongly condemns the detention of hundreds of peaceful protestors throughout Russia that happened on June 12th. Detaining peaceful protestors, human rights observers, and journalists is an affront to core democratic values. The United States will monitor the situation, and we will call on the government of Russia to immediately release all peaceful protestors.\nThe Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve a government that supports an open marketplace of ideas, transparent and accountable governance, equal treatment under the law, and the ability to exercise their rights without fear or retribution.\nQ: Thank you. One more. The President mentioned a press conference in a couple weeks on the ISIS review. Can you say where and when? And has he made a decision about changing the policy?\nMR. SPICER: When we have an update on his schedule, I'll let you know. But we don't have one at this time.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. You said that the President wants to see this Russia investigation and all these investigations wrapped up as soon as possible. He said on Friday that he would be willing to testify under oath. Can you say when he would be willing to do that? Would he be willing to do that before Congress goes into recess to get this done as soon as possible?\nI think that he was actually specifically asked whether or not he would talk to Director Mueller, and he made it very clear what his position was.\nQ: So he would -- sorry, just wanted to be very clear about this. So he's not saying that he would go before Congress --\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I have not had a further discussion with that. I know exactly what he said on Friday in the Rose Garden is exactly what he believes.\nQ: Does he have confidence in Director Mueller, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: John.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two questions. Does the President have a reaction to the vote in Puerto Rico yesterday -- the nonbinding measure calling for statehood as the first choice of the people for their future?\nMR. SPICER: This matter is something that's going to be determined now that the people have spoken in Puerto Rico. This is something that Congress has to address. So the process will have to work its way out through Congress.\nQ: My other question was, there are widespread stories and speculation that when the President goes to Miami this Friday he will undo the executive orders from the Obama administration that eased relations with Cuba. Can you confirm whether he will undo all of them or some of them?\nMR. SPICER: (Laughter.) That's a good try. I will say that when we have an announcement on the President's schedule, we'll let you know. But just stay tuned. We have a very busy week -- an ambitious agenda this week.\nGeorge.\nQ: Thanks. Following on some of the stories over the weekend in England, when the President signs off on a foreign trip, how much does he factor in his personal popularity in that country?\nMR. SPICER: None. And so since you brought it up, just so we're clear on that, Her Majesty extended an invitation to the President. He's accepted that invitation and we look forward to scheduling that trip. But there is nothing that was scheduled, and we look forward to working out a mutually acceptable date with the United Kingdom, and then looking forward to sharing that date with you all when we have it.\nThank you. Have a great Monday. Take care. I'll see you in Wisconsin.\nEND 2:14 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-06-12", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta"}

Nicklaus; Ben Boulware, linebacker, Wayne Gallman, running back, Jadar Johnson, safety, Jordan Leggett, tight end, Artavis Scott, wide receiver, Cordea Tankersley, cornerback, and Mike Williams, wide receiver, Clemson Tigers; and Robert C.

We campaigned long and hard together, right? That worked out well, and you became Governor. So nobody complaining. [Laughter]\nGood afternoon, everybody. Today I'm truly proud to welcome to the White House our College Football Playoff National Champions, the Clemson Tigers. And they look like the real deal, don't they?\nCongratulations to all of you and to your terrific coach—and you know who that is, right? Do we love him? Dabo! Dabo Swinney. What a great job. I was with Coach Belichick; he said, this guy is a real coach. That's a pretty good compliment, right? That's—you can't do better than that. [Laughter] Congratulations, Coach.\nYou have many dedicated fans and admirers here today to celebrate your victory, including many distinguished Members of Congress, lots of them. I especially want to thank your Governor, Henry McMaster, my friend, my endorser. Don't forget, he endorsed me when it wasn't exactly in vogue to do that. So I remember. Right, Henry? And thank you, Henry, and everybody for joining us today.\nClemson Tigers, you gave America an incredible game that will go down in the record books as one of the hardest fought and probably one of the most exciting games ever played. Last second, boomf. [Laughter] That's pretty good, Coach. Good job, Coach.\nAll of you played with such tremendous heart and determination. You never, ever gave up. You can never give up in life. And it all paid off. With your grit and resolve, you proved one of the most important truths in life: that success is about how hard you are willing to fight in order to overcome and in order to win.\nAfter being down 14 to nothing—I don't think the Coach was worried. Were you worried? Yes, probably. [Laughter] A little bit. How about a little bit, Coach? Maybe? You're down 14 to nothing almost halfway through the game, like true tigers, Clemson roared back—and with the whole Nation watching, and beyond the Nation, Deshaun Watson—going to be a great NFL player, watch. Where's Deshaun? Get over here. Come here. Hey, fellas, is he that good? Tell me. You better believe it. He's going to be fantastic. He passed the ball to Hunter Renfrow——where's Hunter? Come here, Hunt. Oh, Hunter, you're so lucky you caught that ball. [Laughter] To score the game-winning touchdown with just 1 second left on the clock, that's pretty cool.\nIt was an inspirational finish to a historic season for Clemson. The team willed their victory—and just, you willed it. That was a victory that was willed. Arnold Palmer, they used to say—great champion—he would will a victory. Jack Nicklaus, he would will a victory. The great champions tend to do that. This team willed their whole way to victory. You came so incredibly close last year against Alabama—you don't remember that game, Coach, do you? [Laughter]\nHead Coach William C. \"Dabo\" Swinney. I remember.\nThe President. You'll never forget. And you wanted a rematch, and you got the rematch, and you went on and you earned it. You beat great teams like Florida State, Ohio State, and of course, your big rival, South Carolina. You believed in yourselves, you believed in each other, and you won a championship victory for the ages. It's one of the greatest games I ever watched, actually.\nPeople are going to be talking about what you did for a very, very long time. That victory and the great comeback was the product of a vision that began 9 years ago, when Coach Swinney assembled a team of assistant coaches who believed in his vision. They recruited great, great players, and together, you worked hard, had fun, and turned Clemson football into a winning machine. It's what it is.\nThe Tigers have gone an astonishing 89 and 28—how did you lose 28 games, Coach? [Laughter] Huh? That was the early seasons, right? Most of them were in the early—while you were building—under the coach's leadership. He helped forge a new culture at Clemson. It was on display in the locker room right after the big game.\nThe coach recalled how he told the team that \"the theme of the College Football Playoffs this year is 'chasing greatness.'\" He told them, \"Nobody is better than us, and we've got to believe it!\" It's great. Tell yourself that: Nobody is better. You chased greatness, and now you've achieved true greatness.\nI understand that on the inside of your championship ring, there's a tiger climbing upwards, and it says \"little extra\"—just a little extra. That's often the difference between winning and losing, just a \"little extra.\" Right, Coach? Is that right? And by the way, standing next to the coach is another winner—your el presidente—Jim Clements. That's another winner, I'll tell you that.\nWe don't talk about Jim too much. But number one, he made a lot of good decisions. Number two, what people don't realize about Clemson—it's a great academic school. One of the top 25.\nClemson University President James P. Clements. Thank you, sir.\nThe President. So—and as a combination, probably number one, right? [Laughter] Great job, Jim.\nThat's how Clemson achieved great things. When you set an expectation of maximum effort and a culture of confidence from the top, you inspire every person to perform at their very, very best.\nAnd that is exactly what you have done. More Tigers this year than ever before—nine of you—went to the NFL Scouting Combine, and two of you were drafted in the first round. That's pretty good.\nBut during that championship game, all of you shined, every single one. Offensive MVP, quarterback Deshaun Watson took some very, very hard hits, but he never rattled. He's great under pressure. I've seen that. I've heard that. He's great under pressure. That's a good thing to be. [Laughter] He is great under pressure. He always got right back up. And he fought, and he fought, and he kept winning. Now he'll bring that toughness together to the Houston Texans. And I have the owners of the Texans here someplace—we just saw them—and they are so excited about Deshaun.\nDefensive tackle Carlos Watkins had an incredible game, and he'll be joining Deshaun in Houston. I'm going to be watching that team very closely. Nobody can read plays like Defensive MVP Ben Boulware. Where's Ben? Carlos—get up here, Carlos. You think I could take these guys in a fight? I don't know. Great guys.\nFirst Team All-American defensive end Christian Wilkins was a big part of the defensive effort in the championship game. And wide receiver Hunter Renfrow had that incredible 10 receptions that night.\nI also want to extend our best wishes to defensive end Richard Yeargin, who suffered a terrible neck injury in a recent automobile accident and is out for the 2017 season. But he'll be back. And we're praying for you. And, Richard, I know you're going to get better and you're going to be all set.\nAll of you are continuing a proud sporting tradition at Clemson, established long ago by some of football's greatest champions and leaders. Your school was home to the legendary Coach Heisman—Heisman Trophy—who delivered a win in the Tigers' first Alabama matchup way back in 1900. I know Coach Heisman would be very proud of you, Coach, today, looking down, would be very proud—he liked to win; he knew winners—and his team's most recent, incredible, and most exciting victory.\nSo thank you for being here today. It's our honor to be in the company of great, great champions. And that's what they are. I wish you all the best in your careers, wherever they may take you. Whether it's football or business or anything else, you're going to be very successful. And if you work hard, fight hard, and believe in yourselves, perhaps I'll see you one day back here right at the White House.\nIn fact, I think one of the folks behind me has a really good chance of standing where I am today as a future President of the United States. They have that tremendous, incredible talent, more than just athletic talent.\nSo congratulations, again, to the College Football Playoff National Champions, the Clemson Tigers! And with that, I want to introduce President Jim Clements, who has truly done an amazing job on and off the field. And he's a special man—that I can tell you.\nJim, come on up and say a few words.", "timestamp": "2017-06-12", "title": "Remarks Honoring the 2016 College Football Playoff National Champion Clemson University Tigers"}

During this week, I encourage all fathers, brothers, and sons to prioritize their health and well-being by learning more about preventative health practices and steps they can take to live longer, healthier lives.\nEven with tremendous recent advances in technology and healthcare, many men still face a broad range of distinctive health issues. The life expectancy for men in the United States is about five years shorter than for women. Many men visit their healthcare providers less frequently than women. One in three American men suffers from a condition related to cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for men.\nWe must ensure that the market for healthcare works for both men and women. Unfortunately, that is not the case today. The current system is failing many Americans, men and women alike, leaving millions with fewer choices for health insurance, skyrocketing premiums, and burdensome out-of-pocket costs. Removing barriers to quality and affordable healthcare is critical to healthcare outcomes throughout our society.\nDuring Men's Health Week, we support expanded education, awareness, and choice in healthcare.

He also referred to H.R. 1628 and S. 1094; and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist organization. The transcript, prepared for immediate release by the Office of the Press Secretary, was received by the Office of the Federal Register on July 27.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128077", "text": "The President. Good morning. We have much great news to share with the American people today as we continue to deliver on our promises.\nDue to a record-long delay in confirmation and the confirmation process by the Senate Democrats—which I call the obstructionists; maybe they'll change, but I doubt it for a while. But they are truly obstructionists—this is our first Cabinet meeting with our entire Cabinet present. The confirmation process has been record-setting long—and I mean record-setting long—with some of the finest people in our country being delayed and delayed and delayed. But that's—much of that is over, and now we are—we're going through, as you know, the regular process with people at other levels of Government. And that's a very long process also, including Ethics Committee, which has become very difficult to deal with.\nAll of that being said, we now have our Cabinet finally approved. And I want to welcome Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue—thanks, Sonny; Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta; Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats—thank you, Dan; and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.\nThere is an incredibly talented group of people in this room: generals, Governors, Congressmen, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and many, many others. I choose each person at this table, and I chose them not only because of their remarkable experience and success, but because they've all united by one shared goal. What they want to do is one very simple but very beautiful goal: serving and defending our beloved Nation.\nTogether, we're working every day—and we've been working very hard together—for our country: to protect their safety, bringing back jobs into our country, and putting always America first.\nAnd when I ran, it was \"Make America Great Again,\" and that's what we're doing. Believe me, we're doing it, and we're doing at a much faster pace than anyone thought. I will say that never has there been a President, with few exceptions—in the case of FDR, he had a major Depression to handle—who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the Executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated; many bills—I guess, over 34 bills in Congress signed; a Supreme Court Justice who's going to be a great one, that will be a great Supreme Court Justice; and many other things. We've achieved tremendous success. And I think we've been about as active as you can possibly be and at a just-about record-setting pace.\nAnd we're achieving these goals by eliminating these job-killing regulations, unlocking American energy, rebuilding our military, pursuing fair and reciprocal trade deals, achieving massive reductions in illegal immigration, transforming the Department of Veterans Affairs, and building a new partnership among nations to defeat terrorism, which we have to do.\nIn just a very short time, we're seeing amazing results. And in fact, there are a couple of major stories today in the newspapers about mines that are opening, and the miners are going back to work. Actually, they're pretty big stories. People are surprised. It's kicking in very fast. More small businesses are planning to hire than at any point in over a decade. And last month, unemployment fell to its lowest point in 16 years. I recently returned from a trip overseas that included deals for more than $350 billion worth of military and economic investment in the United States. These deals will bring many thousands of jobs to our country—and, in fact, will bring millions of jobs, ultimately—and help Saudi Arabia take a greater role in providing stability and security in that region.\nOne of the big things that we did—and you're seeing it now with Qatar and all of the things that are actually going on in a very positive fashion—we are stopping the funding of terrorism. They are going to stop the funding of terrorism. And it's not an easy fight, but that's a fight we're going to win. They will be—you have to starve the beast, and we're going to starve the beast, believe me.\nSecretary Price has been working very hard to repeal and replace Obamacare. The House passed a bill; the Senate has it right now. Mitch McConnell is working very, very hard, as are the Republican Senators. We will have zero backing from the Democrats, even though they should get in and do something. But we expect to get zero. If we had the greatest bill in the history of the world on health care, we wouldn't get one vote from the Democrats, because they're obstructionists. That's what they want to do. That's the game. They think that's their best political game. They're looking to '18. So far, we've had two races, and we've won both of those races. They've spent millions and millions of dollars on congressional races. We have another one coming up, and we've been doing very well. But they're obstructionists, and that's sad. But we are coming up with something that I believe will be very good, with zero support from the obstructionist Democrats. Sad.\nSecretary Mnuchin is helping us put together one of the biggest tax cuts in American history. It may be the biggest single tax cut in American history. And that also includes a great deal of tax reform, simplification, and other things.\nDirector Mulvaney has led our efforts to introduce a new budget that cuts wasteful Washington spending and protects the taxpayer. And that will come out. And believe me, we'll take care of the people that have to be taken care of. So that's the first step. But we will be taking care of the people that have to be taken care of. On a human basis, that's very, very important.\nToday we're going to hear from Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Mattis on the ways that we're combating ISIS and defeating terrorism. We've had tremendous success against ISIS in our fight in the Middle East, where we're doing very, very well. We're going to be having a news conference in 2 weeks on that fight, and you'll see numbers that you would not have believed. And frankly, if you look back to even 6 months ago, you wouldn't have believed it was possible.\nSecretary Shulkin will give us an update on his tremendous work to make sure that our veterans are finally given the care that they deserve, one of the most important things to me on the campaign trail. We've also been strongly pushing for passage of the VA Accountability Act, to ensure employees at the VA can be held accountable if they fail our great veterans. It's passed the Senate, and the House is voting tomorrow. So tomorrow we have a big vote coming up, David, and I think we're going to be in good shape. But that's something that is going to be great for our veterans.\nWe're also going to hear from Secretary Acosta about a major announcement that I'll be making later this week, expanding apprenticeships and getting our people back to work. While we have the lowest number in terms of unemployment in many, many years, at the same time, I've always argued with that number because it doesn't take into account millions and millions of people that have given up looking for jobs. And we're going to be doing something about that. And we're going to get those people back to work. And it's already starting in Ohio, and it's starting in Pennsylvania and North Carolina and South Carolina and Florida. You see the numbers. And they're starting. I call them the forgotten men and women, but they're not going to be forgotten much longer, believe me.\nThere are millions of good jobs that lead to great careers, jobs that do not require a 4-year degree or the massive debt that often comes with those 4-year degrees and even 2-year degrees. These jobs require advanced skills and technical training, and we're going to start that. The apprenticeships—a very good word from the Trump standpoint, the word \"apprentice\"—[laughter]—apprenticeships are going to be a big, big factor in our country. They're people with tremendous talent, maybe a mechanical talent or maybe a talent for fixing an engine or a motor. Met a lot of people that graduated high in their class at the best colleges in the world, have no clue, and they would never be good at it. It's a different kind of an ability, but it's a great ability nevertheless.\nWe're going to help get our young people the technical training that they need to pursue really exciting careers and careers that they can make good money. They can really earn a great, great salary and maybe even open small businesses.\nIf everyone in this room continues to do their jobs, then we can restore American prosperity and make millions and millions of dollars, and we can make for these people—and the American Dream come true. We're going make the American Dream come true for a lot of people that will not have had that experience without the election results that we had on November 8.\nSo we're here to change Washington, return power to the people. We're here to give people a great shot at a great, great job and even opening small businesses and employing other people.\nI look forward to hearing all of the reports from the different people in the room today. We have done, as I said, about as much as anybody ever in a short period of time in the Presidency. That's despite tremendous opposition from the other side. We have done something that's very special. And you see it in the economic numbers, because the economic numbers have been incredible. One just came out: Almost $4 trillion in worth has been created in the stock markets of our country. You just take a look at that. Seven-hundred thousand jobs have been created in a very short period of time since the election—700,000 jobs.\nIf we would have said that on November 8, nobody would have believed the number. If we would have said that almost $4 trillion in the stock markets has been created, everybody would have laughed at us. They would have said, oh, that's ridiculous. But that's what it is.\nSo we're very proud of it. We have a phenomenal team of people, a great group of talent, and we are really now seeing the early fruits of their labor. Some of them won't be able to kick in because, statutorily, you have to wait periods of time before you're allowed to do the final.\nWe'll be having some major legislation very soon on the dumping of steel in our country, which is absolutely killing our workers and our steel companies. We're going to be having some very major legislation on the dumping of aluminum and various other things into our country, which is killing our workers. And we'll be announcing that very soon.\nSo I think what we'll do—most of you know most of the people around the room, but I'm going to start with our Vice President. Where is our Vice President? [Laughter] Our Vice President, there he is. And I'll maybe start with Mike, and we'll just go around, and just your name, your position, and then we'll ask these folks to go back and have a good day, and we're going to discuss our various reports.\nMike.\nVice President Michael R. Pence. Thank you, Mr. President. And just the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who is keeping his word to the American people and assembling a team that's bringing real change, real prosperity, and real strength back to our Nation.\nThe President. Thank you, Mike.\nAttorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III. Mr. President, it's great to be here and celebrate this group. We are receiving, as you know—I'm not sure the rest of you fully understand—the support with law enforcement all over America. They have been very frustrated. They are so thrilled that we have a new idea that we're going to support them and work together to properly, lawfully fight the rising crime that we're seeing.\nThe President. That's good.\nAttorney General Sessions. And it's an honor to be able to serve you in that regard. You've set the exact, right message, and it's being responded—the response is fabulous around the country.\nThe President. Great success, including MS-13. They're being thrown out in record numbers and rapidly. And they're being depleted. They'll all be gone pretty soon. So you're right, Jeff. Thank you very much.\nAlex.\nSecretary of Labor R. Alexander Acosta. Mr. President, I am privileged to be here, deeply honored. And I want to thank you for keeping your commitment to the American workers. This week is a full schedule for you, focusing on the American worker. We're very excited at the Department of Labor. And the apprenticeship program that you're going to be announcing, I think, is going to make a real difference.\nThe President. Thank you. Congratulations.\nSecretary of Energy J. Richard Perry. Mr. President, honored to be on the team. This last week I had the great privilege to represent America in China at the Green Energy Ministerial. Good timing. They needed to hear why America was stepping away from the Paris accord—and they did—and that America is not stepping back, but we're stepping into place and sending some messages that we're still going to be leaders in the world when it comes to the climate, but we're not going to be held hostage to some Executive order that was ill-thought-out. And so my hat is off to you for taking that stand and for sending a clear message around the world that America is going to continue to lead in the area of energy.\nThe President. Thank you, Rick. Thank you.\nU.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Nikki R. Haley. Thank you, Mr. President. It's a new day at the United Nations. We now have a very strong voice. People know what the United States is for, they know what we're against, and they see us leading across the board. And so I think the international community knows we're back.\nThe President. Thank you, Nikki. That's true. Office of Management and Budget Director John M. \"Mick\" Mulvaney. Mr. President, thank you for your kind words about the budget. You're absolutely right, we are going to be able to take care of the people who really need it. But at the same time, with your direction, we were able to also focus on the forgotten man and woman who are the folks who were paying those taxes. And I appreciate your support and your direction in pulling that budget together.\nThe President. Thank you, Mick.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator E. Scott Pruitt. Good morning, Mr. President. It's good to be back in the United States. Actually, I arrived back this morning at 1 o'clock from Italy, from the G-7 summit, focused on the environment. And our message there was that the United States is going to be focused on growth and protecting the environment. It was received well.\nThe President. Good job, Scott.\nDirector of National Intelligence Daniel R. Coats. Good morning, Mr. President. The intelligence community has never faced such a diversity of threats to our country in our lifetimes. We have men and women who are working 24/7, 7 days a week, to make sure that we are on top of all of these threats. It's a joy to be working with the people that I have inherited, and we're going to provide—continue to provide you with the very best intelligence we can so you can formulate policies to deal with these issues.\nThe President. Thank you, Dan.\nSecretary of Education Elisabeth P. DeVos. Mr. President, it's a privilege to serve, to serve the students of this country, and to work to ensure that every child has an equal opportunity to get a great education and, therefore, a great future.\nThe President. Thank you, Betsy.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Thomas E. Price. Mr. President, what an incredible honor it is to lead the Department of Health and Human Services at this pivotal time under your leadership. I can't thank you enough for the privilege that you've given me and the leadership that you've shown. It seems like there's an international flair to the messages that are being delivered. I had the opportunity to represent the United States at the G-20 Health Summit in Berlin and at the World Health Assembly in Geneva. And I can't tell you how excited and enthusiastic folks are about the United States leadership as it relates to global health security.\nThe President. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nSecretary of the Interior Ryan K. Zinke. Mr. President, as your SEAL on your staff—[laughter].\nThe President. That's true.\nSecretary Zinke. ——and it's an honor to be your steward of our public lands and the generator of energy dominance. And I am deeply honored. And I am committed and optimistic that we can be both great stewards and be the world's largest producer of energy.\nThe President. Good. And you can do both. Thank you very much. Thanks, Ryan.\nRex.\nSecretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. President, thank you for the honor to serve the country. It's a great privilege you've given me. Clearly, we are engaged with our allies to ensure that they know where our common interests lie, what our expectations are: that America will continue to be a leader, but they must do more. And they must meet their obligations both from a national security standpoint, but also for creating conditions of stability and prosperity.\nAnd for our adversaries, we are engaging and will engage, but they have to know that we will be engaging from a position of strength, to protect America's national interest, and we expect to make progress on resolving some of these differences.\nThe President. Thanks, Rex.\nSecretary of Defense James N. Mattis. Mr. President, it's an honor to represent the men and women of the Department of Defense, and we are grateful for the sacrifices our people are making in order to strengthen our military so our diplomats always negotiate from a position of strength. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you, Jim. Thank you.\nSecretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to help fix the trade deficit and other things. The other countries are gradually getting used to the fact that the free rides are somewhat over with. They're not happy with it, but I think they're—have a growing recognition of it. So I'm thrilled to have a chance to help you live up to your campaign promises.\nThe President. Good. Thank you, Wilbur.\nSecretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao. Mr. President, last week was a great week. It was Infrastructure Week. Thank you so much for coming over to the Department of Transportation. Hundreds and hundreds of people were just so thrilled, hanging out, watching the whole ceremony. I want to thank you for getting this country moving again and also working again.\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nSecretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly. Mr. President, proud to be here. Certainly very proud to represent the quarter of a million men and women that serve the country in DHS. In the 5 months that I've been in the job, we have gone a long way to facilitate the—improve the legal movement of people and commerce across our borders and, yet at the same time, have gone a long way to safeguarding our borders, particularly the southern border, working with all of our partners to the South. A 70-percent drop in illegal immigration. While we still welcome legal immigrants to the tune of over a million a year, we are no longer a friendly environment for illegal border crosses.\nThe President. Thank you\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer. Mr. President, first of all, I apologize for being late for work. [Laughter] About 4 months, I got bogged down in that swamp that you've been trying to drain—[laughter]. I also have traveled. I just got back from Paris, where we met with the OECD and the WTO both. And the message was similar to Wilbur's. It was deficits do matter, and ours are coming down. Pleasure to be here.\nThe President. Thank you. I know they are.\nSmall Business Administration Administrator Linda E. McMahon. Good morning, Mr. President. Thank you for the opportunity to serve at SBA. And I can tell you that as—I haven't been traveling internationally, but I've been traveling around the country. And what I'm continuing to hear is this renewed optimism from small businesses, higher than it's been in about 16 years. So those people returning to the workforce, a lot of them are because small businesses are creating new jobs. So loan portfolios are up, mentoring, and our outreach with SCORE and our other programs are being so successful. So thank you. We're on a good trajectory and still a lot of work to do.\nThe President. Thank you.\nWhite House Chief of Staff Reinhold R. \"Reince\" Priebus. On behalf of the entire senior staff around you, Mr. President, we thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you've given us to serve your agenda and the American people. And we're continuing to work very hard every day to accomplish those goals.\nDirector of Central Intelligence Michael R. Pompeo. Mr. President, it's an honor to serve as your CIA Director. It's an incredible privilege to lead the men and women who are providing intelligence so that we can do the national security mission. And in the finest traditions at CIA, I'm not going to say a damn thing in front of the media. [Laughter]\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs David J. Shulkin. Mr. President, thank you for your support and commitment to honoring our responsibility to America's veterans. I know that this is personally very important to you. I have the great honor of being able to represent the 21 million American veterans that have done such great things for this country. And I have worked every day to make sure that we're honoring that responsibility. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you very much.\nBen.\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development Benjamin S. Carson, Sr. Mr. President, it's been a great honor to work with you. Thank you for your strong support of HUD and for all the others around this table that I've worked with. We're making tremendous progress in converting to a business model. Already seeing tremendous savings there.\nAnd this month is National Homeowners Month, and therefore, I'll be ringing the bell on Wall Street at 4 o'clock, which means I've got to leave at 12:00. Thanks. [Laughter]\nSecretary of Agriculture George E. \"Sonny\" Perdue. Good morning, Mr. President. While we're bragging about international travel, I just got back from Mississippi. [Laughter] They love you there. [Laughter]\nAnd I want to congratulate you on the men and women you've placed around this table. The holistic team of working for America is making results in each and every area. Working with Secretary Ross and Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Mnuchin and Tom Price and Scott Pruitt—this is a team you've assembled that's working hand-in-glove with—for the betterment of America, and I want to thank you for that. These are great team members, and we're on your team.\nThe President. Thank you, Sonny. Thank you.\nSecretary of the Treasury Stephen T. Mnuchin. Thank you, Mr. President. It was a great honor traveling with you around the country for the last year and an even greater honor to be here serving in your Cabinet.

Thank you for those gracious words and insights, and especially just thank you for your service to this administration and your lifelong dedication to patient-centered healthcare. As a physician, as a public official, you've literally dedicated your life to the health and well-being of the American people. And Secretary Tom Price, we are grateful for your service. (Applause.)\nYou mentioned my Indiana roots, so you'll not be terribly surprised to know that I'm also grateful to be joined today by a fellow Hoosier, who literally has brought a lifetime of experience in healthcare policy to her new role as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Would you join me in thanking Seema Verma for her character and her vision and her professionalism? Thank you, Seema. (Applause.)\nNow I'm really honored to be here today at the United States Department of Health and Human Services. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.\nI really came here today to do two things -- to express the President's appreciation for the work that each one of you do here at Health and Human Services, and, of course, to address one of the most pressing issues facing the American people today, the ongoing collapse of the Affordable Care Act.\nBut first, a word of gratitude for all the dedicated men and women of the Department of Health and Human Services. Day-in and day-out, the public servants in this room and all across the country, improve the health, safety, and well-being of America. It's not an overstatement in the least. And the President and I are truly grateful for your service and your dedication.\nUnder this roof, and in these halls, the men and women of HHS have spent more than 60 years working on behalf of the well-being of the American people.\nToday, the Department of Health and Human Services employs 80,000 people and runs more than 100 programs and projects that impact American communities and American lives every single day.\nThrough the Food and Drug Administration, you make sure that the food we eat and the medicine we take is safe and effective.\nThrough the Centers for Disease Control, you protect the American people from the threat of epidemic.\nYou help families get on their feet through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program.\nAnd of course, you help tens of millions of seniors and vulnerable Americans get the healthcare they need through Medicare and Medicaid.\nThe truth is that your work changes lives and improves lives every day. There's an old saying, that when everybody in your family is healthy, you have lots of problems. But when one person in your family isn't healthy, you've got one problem.\nReality is you focus on that which is most important to the American people, the health and well-being of their loved ones.\nYou are, in a very real sense, the hands and feet of a caring nation, committed to the health and well-being of our people. And make no mistake about it and never doubt it: The Department of Health and Human Services and all you dedicated employees make a difference in the lives of Americans every single day. Would you just give yourselves a round of applause because you deserve it -- and all those that are looking on?\nSo I'm here to say thanks, but also to address the ongoing collapse of the Affordable Care Act, or as the President says more clearly, literally the \"death spiral\" of Obamacare.\nI can promise you this President is fighting every single day to rescue the American people from this policy, to repeal and replace Obamacare, and give the American people access to the world-class healthcare that every American deserves.\nNow I know this room is filled with men and women who care deeply about bringing high-quality healthcare to every American, and rest assured, President Donald Trump wants exactly the same thing.\nThe President's vision for healthcare is really pretty straightforward. We want a dynamic national, health insurance marketplace that lowers costs, increases quality, and gives more choices to working families. We want American businesses to have the freedom to give their employees the affordable coverage that they need and deserve. We want to give states the freedom and flexibility to create the healthcare system that works best for them, for their most vulnerable. And most of all, we want to empower the American people to make healthcare choices that are best for them in a free and open process.\nIn short, under President Donald Trump, we seek a brighter healthcare future for every American. This will be the North Star for our administration, and for everyone who works on healthcare here at HHS.\nBut make no mistake about it: To make this vision a reality, President Donald Trump is going to keep his promise to the American people, and working with this Congress, we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nWe all remember all the broken promises of Obamacare. I was actually in the Congress when I heard them ushered forth on the floor of the House of Representatives. They told us if you like your doctor, you could keep him. They told us if you like your health plan, you could keep it. They said if Obamacare passed, that health insurance premiums would go down.\nPresident Abraham Lincoln once said, \"Give the people the facts and the Republic will be saved,\" and thanks to the exceptional work here at HHS, the American people now have new, hard facts. And they know for a fact that Obamacare has failed.\nLast month, the professionals here at Health and Human Services issued a study showing how Obamacare has actually led to skyrocketing premiums across this country. This report found that premiums have more than doubled since Obamacare went into effect.\nWhether it's Nevada, North Dakota, or Ohio -- every state has seen premiums spike under this failed law. In Louisiana they're up 123 percent. In Tennessee they're up by more than 175 percent. In Alaska, Alabama, Oklahoma, tens of thousands of people are paying three times more for their plan under Obamacare.\nRemember the last administration promised that Obamacare would lower premiums on the individual market by up to $2,500 for American families? The reality: Premiums have actually increased by nearly $3,000 on working families across this country.\nAt this moment, millions of Americans are facing double-digit premium hikes heading into 2018.\nAnd while costs are soaring, even worse still, choices are plummeting. Insurance companies are pulling out of Obamacare left and right.\nRight now a third of American counties, including five whole states, only have one choice of Obamacare insurance coverage -- meaning they essentially have no choice at all.\nAnd as the map on the stage shows, using information HHS released just yesterday, tens of thousands of Americans, or more, won't have any insurance options at all next year.\nIn the past few weeks, the last health insurers have announced exits from at least 23 Obamacare markets.\nTake a look at Ohio where the last statewide insurer announced two weeks ago that they're likely to leave Obamacare. The red squares on the map are counties without any coverage. More than 13,000 citizens in Ohio will be affected with this no-choice option.\nNow look at Missouri. Some 25 counties in the Show Me State won't have any insurance available under Obamacare.\nAnd if you look just north in Iowa, you'll see that nearly the entire state only has one insurer. And if that company pulls out, which it has said it might well do, then 94 out of 99 counties in Iowa will be completely without coverage under Obamacare.\nAnd remember, many insurers are still deciding whether to pull out under Obamacare exchanges. If and when they do, hundreds of thousands or even millions more Americans could have no health insurance options this time next year. With premiums more than doubling for the average American, with deductibles so high that most Americans can't afford to use their Obamacare coverage, it's no surprise that Obamacare itself has woefully fallen short of its goal to cover the American people, as the other chart on the stage shows.\nBack when Obamacare was first passed, just over seven years ago, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 23 million Americans would be covered by now. That's the blue line on the far left. It quickly became apparent that this was farfetched -- to put it mildly.\nLast October, the Obama administration estimated that 14 million Americans would be covered by now. That's the next line. Yet as HHS released just yesterday, and as the red bar shows, in reality, it's even lower. As of March of this year, while 12.2 million selected a plan, only 10.3 million Americans actually paid for their premiums. That's less than half the number that was predicted under Obamacare. And nearly two million Americans dropped out in the same year, not paying the premiums that they had signed up to pay for.\nAs the President said just moments ago, 2 million more people just dropped out of Obamacare. It is a death spiral. And as CMS explained in the same report yesterday, in their words, \"high costs and a lack of affordability were the most common factors individuals cited when asked why they didn't keep their coverage.\"\nThe Affordable Care Act is failing, and American families and businesses are paying the price. You see, it's not just about the statistics, although policymakers in Washington, D.C. always have to look at the big picture. But you here at HHS know, this is about real people. This is about American families. This is about a burden that's being placed on the American people, one American at a time.\nI've seen it firsthand as I've traveled around this country. I've heard it from small business owners in roundtables where we've gathered and heard about the weight of Obamacare's taxes and mandates on their business that have caused some of them to speak with tears in their eyes about their decision to discontinue health insurance coverage for their cherished employees of many years.\nAnd I've heard it from individuals like Julie Champine just this past Saturday in Wisconsin. You know, I met Julie on a trip to Milwaukee and she's a great lady. Has a great family -- she and her husband have been working their hearts out in their small business for many years. But Julie confided in me that she's got some pretty serious health issues. And health insurance is just vitally important to her.\nNow, Julie has been buying her insurance on the individual market since 2004. She told me she wanted to believe it when President Obama said that she would be able to keep her plan and keep her doctor. But it turned out it just wasn't true. Julie lost her health plan. Then she lost her doctor. And ever since, she's been forced to buy unaffordable and unusable health insurance on the Obamacare exchange.\nIn 2016 alone, Julie told me that the Obamacare plan for her family cost more than $9,000 in premiums with a deductible of $13,000. And late last year, she found out her premiums were going to go up by another $2,600 this year. At this very moment, Julie told me that her Obamacare health insurance plan costs more than her mortgage, and she can't even afford to use it because of the high deductible.\nIn fact, she told me with genuine emotion in her voice that a few months back, she actually made the decision to go without health insurance for several months just so she could afford Christmas presents for her kids and her grandkids. That's the real cost of Obamacare on the American people. It's just wrong.\nBut that's the choice too many Americans are forced to make under this unaffordable Affordable Care Act. Julie basically said to me for the longest time, she just felt like we had no hope. But I looked her in the eye, and I told her, Julie, help is on the way. (Applause.) And I promise you it is.\nThe simple truth is, President Trump is right. Obamacare is collapsing. And frankly, you'd have to be blinded by partisanship to believe otherwise. And unfortunately, a lot of people in this town are, like most of the Democrats in Congress, for instance.\nThe American people deserve to know that the ones who gave us Obamacare now won't even lift a finger to help us clean up the mess that they created.\nAnd their willing allies in the media continue to try to lay the blame for Obamacare's failures on this President, this administration as we try to rescue the American people from its failings.\nBut fortunately, thanks to the efforts of Speaker Paul Ryan, on May 4th the House of Representatives passed the American Health Care Act -- legislation that will repeal the taxes and penalties of Obamacare, expand health savings accounts, and give states historic flexibility to reform Medicaid in ways that will best serve the most vulnerable in their communities.\nAnd as we speak, the American people should be encouraged to know that under the leadership of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and hardworking members of U.S. Senate majority, the Senate is, as we speak, working tirelessly to improve this legislation and create an orderly framework to transition our healthcare economy away from the regulations and mandates and taxes of Obamacare to a patient-centered healthcare system built on personal responsibility, free-market competition, and state-based reform.\nIn fact, the President and I will be welcoming key members of the United States Senate to the White House at lunch today to continue discussions on how we can move forward to repeal and replace Obamacare and rescue the American people from the ongoing collapse of this failed policy.\nFor the past seven years, under Obamacare, we've had a healthcare system based on the misguided premise that the federal government should order every American to buy health insurance, whether they want it, or need it, or not; that politicians know better than patients and doctors; and that --worst of all, that the American people cannot be trusted to run their own lives or make their own healthcare choices.\nPresident Trump is fighting every day to restore basic freedom to America's health insurance system. And the men and women of Health and Human Services are essential to this effort.\nEach of you in this room, and the some-80,000 employees of Health and Human Services, I know are men and women who've answered the call to public service because you care deeply about the health and well-being of the American people. Well, I'm here to say thank you for answering that call.\nAnd just know -- as we move forward, as we give the American people more choices for more affordable healthcare, we give states freedom and flexibility to meet the needs of our most vulnerable, know that you, the dedicated men and women of the Department of Health and [Human] Services, will continue to play a leading role in making the best healthcare system in the world even better.\nThank you for your service to the American people. God bless each of you, God bless all our healthcare providers, and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-06-13", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President on Healthcare"}

SANDERS: I know that it's late and you guys are probably tired, so we'll keep this short. Obviously, the President was focused today primarily on healthcare in a meeting earlier today with a number of senators, as well as with Obamacare victims once he got on the ground here in Wisconsin. Also with a heavy emphasis on workforce development which he's focused on all week this week. And those are the big priorities that he spent the majority of his day today on and will continue through the rest of this week.\nAgain, because I know that you have probably lots of questions, I'll leave it at that and we can go ahead and jump in.\nQ: Is the President considering whether or not he will fire or seek to have Robert Mueller fired as the Special Counsel?\nMS. SANDERS: While the President has the right to, he has no intention to do so.\nQ: Did the President watch any of the Jeff Sessions testimony? And what did he think?\nMS. SANDERS: He wasn't able to watch much of it. He was preparing for the stop here today. But what he did see and what he heard -- he thought that Attorney General Sessions did a very good job, and, in particular, was very strong on the point that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\nQ: Sarah, did the President call the GOP healthcare bill \"mean\" during his lunch with senators today?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware. I wasn't part of that meeting. But I know, in general practice, we don't comment on rumors or private conversations of that nature.\nQ: Has the President authorized Secretary of Defense Mattis to set troop levels in Afghanistan?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't have anything I can comment on that right now, and I would refer you to Secretary Mattis at this point.\nQ: Sarah, the North Koreans sent back a university student who's in a coma. What does the President think about the fact that this young man is in a coma?\nMS. SANDERS: Obviously, you know, that's extremely sad, but bringing Otto home was a big priority for the President. He worked very hard and very closely with Secretary of State Tillerson in order to do that. And right now, his thoughts and prayers are with his family.\nQ: Can you give us a little bit more detail on that? What do you mean when you say he worked hard with Tillerson? I know this all sort of came to a head, I guess, on June 6th when the United States was informed about his condition. But can you give us some detail about meetings or discussions or what the President had?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at this time. And the Secretary of State may be able to provide more information on that front.\nQ: Sarah, the President has said he wants the Republican healthcare plan to be more generous. What does he mean by that?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to comment on rumored conversations, but I'll let him -- he's been speaking about healthcare and his position on that. I think the big priority for him is the fact that Obamacare is completely collapsing and we have to repeal and replace it. And as he's made very clear, that's a big priority for him right now.\nQ: Sarah, he said that in public.\nQ: That was in a pool report.\nMS. SANDERS: Okay.\nQ: There has also been talk that a senate bill could even be coming out tonight. Is the President -- so far, when he heard from all these senators today, is he happy with the direction that the Senate Republicans seem to be going in? Is he pushing them to be more generous on preexisting conditions? Or -- you know, where does he stand in relation to the Senate bill?\nMS. SANDERS: I think at this point, he's just encouraged that things are moving forward. And again, I think his biggest priority is making sure that we get the best healthcare possible for the American people because the one we have isn't sustainable. And so he's going to continue working with both the Senate and the House to make sure that Obamacare is repealed and replaced with something much better that's affordable and sustainable.\nQ: Sarah, do you have any more details on the announcement that's expected on Friday about changes to Cuba policy? What parts of the Obamacare administration's policy is the President planning to roll back? And what is he planning to announce in Miami?\nMS. SANDERS: There aren't any final decisions on that front yet. But as soon as we have information on that, I would be happy to share it with you.\nQ: Just to follow up on that, you mean there's no final decisions? Or you just don't have them to provide for us?\nMS. SANDERS: My understanding is there's not a final decision and that it's all still being reviewed at this time.\nQ: But he is going down there despite the fact that no final decision --\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we haven't made an announcement about that specifically, but we'll keep you posted when we do.\nQ: Has the President decided when he's going to announce whether he has tapes of the Comey conversations?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know that he's made any more decision on that other than what he said at the press conference last -- that it would be soon.\nQ: What are the President's feelings on Mueller at this point? Did he interview him for FBI director? And does he have confidence in him in his current role?\nMS. SANDERS: I do know that he did interview him, I believe, the day before he was named as Special Counsel. And beyond that, what I said earlier, I don't have anything to add.\nQ: Do you have any more details on the workforce development stuff -- whether the apprenticeship program is only in high schools or whether it would be corporations? Any more details on how that would work or how it would be encouraged?\nMS. SANDERS: No. I know that some more details will be coming out at the event tomorrow, and certainly don't want to get ahead of any announcements there. But happy to answer questions following up from there.\nQ: The President said something today about wanting to have every high school in the country have an apprenticeship program, and I hadn't heard that in any of the background information. Is that something that's going to be part of these announcements too? Or was he just kind of speaking a little off-the-cuff on that?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get ahead of any announcements or the event that will take place tomorrow. I'll let the President make those announcements at that time.\nAnything else? Also, I do know -- just to add in, you had asked me specifically about the fundraiser tonight. It was for the Friends of Scott Walker, and I think roughly over 300 people attended.\nQ: Do you know how much money was raised?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't heard that yet. But if I do, I'll let you know.\nAll right, thanks guys.\nEND 8:31 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-06-13", "title": "Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders"}

King, R-IA, and three cosponsors)\nThe Administration supports H.R. 1215, the Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017. The rising cost of healthcare is a major concern in our Nation. State medical liability rules often allow for unlimited non-economic damages. This encourages providers to practice defensive medicine, increases the cost of healthcare, and imposes a significant burden on healthcare providers.\nH.R. 1215 would limit non-economic damages to $250,000 and limit the fees lawyers may charge in a healthcare lawsuit. The bill would also impose a three-year statute of limitations on such lawsuits. H.R. 1215 would apply to healthcare lawsuits where coverage was provided through a Federal program, subsidy, or tax benefit. The bill reflects a reform proposed in President Trump's Fiscal Year 2018 budget.\nIn addition to the provisions in H.R. 1215, the President's FY 2018 Budget proposal would also modify the collateral source rule to allow evidence of a claimant's income from other sources to be introduced at trial. The proposal would provide a safe harbor for providers based on defined clinical standards; authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide guidance to States to create expert panels and administrative healthcare tribunals; and exclude provider expressions of regret or apology from evidence in a healthcare lawsuit. These additional policies would likely generate additional savings to patients and to the Federal Government by reducing unnecessary medical services. They may also promote evidence-based practices, reduce provider burden, and improve relationships between physicians and patients.

By protecting the integrity of Federal funds, this bill furthers the President's vision of a more efficient Federal Government that respects taxpayer dollars.\nH.R. 2581 would prohibit advance payments of premium tax credits to individuals under current law and the AHCA, unless the Secretary of the Treasury receives confirmation that the individual is a citizen or a national of the United States, or is lawfully present in the United States.

Ernst; and Vice President Michael R. Pence. He also referred to H.R. 1628.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126331", "text": "The President. Thank you very much. I greatly appreciate it. I'm very happy that you're all here today, Republican Senators. We're going to be discussing the urgent need to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It was just announced yesterday that 2 million people have dropped out of Obamacare, 2 million additional. They are leaving fast. Premiums have increased by an average of more than 100 percent nationwide.\nIn North Carolina, premiums have gone up 176 percent. In Arkansas, premiums have gone up 128 percent. In Pennsylvania, premiums have gone up by 120 percent. And I hate to say this to you, Lisa, but in Alaska, they've gone up 207 percent on Obamacare. You know, I used to mention only Arizona because they were up 116 percent in Arizona. Now Arizona is, like, good by comparison to some of the numbers. But they're way up in Arizona also.\nInsurers are fleeing the market. Last week, it was announced that one of the largest insurers is pulling out of Ohio—the great State of Ohio—that could mean another 20 counties. At least 19,000 people in Ohio will have no plan at all.\nNationwide, 1 in 3 U.S. counties have only a single insurer, and many of those insurers, as you know, have announced that they're leaving. Obamacare has been broken, and it's been a broken promise. One after another, Americans were told that if you liked your doctor, you'll keep your doctor. That was a lie. They were told that if you liked your plan, you'd keep your plan. That was a lie. Americans were told that premiums would go down by $2,500 per year. And instead, their premiums went up to levels that nobody thought even possible.\nThe House has passed a bill, and now the Senate is working very, very hard, and specifically the folks in this room. And I really appreciate what you're doing to come out with a bill that's going to be a phenomenal bill for the people of our country: generous, kind, with heart. That's what I'm saying. And that may be adding additional money into it. We're going to come out with a real bill, not Obamacare. And the results are going to be fantastic, and hopefully, it will be announced at the appropriate time, and everyone is going to be happy.\nBut by contrast, Republicans in Congress, as hard as they're working, you have the Democrats on the other side who truly have become obstructionists. Even their new motto, \"Resist\"—and I guess it's a pretty accurate motto. Every time I see it, I say, that's right, that does represent the Democrats. It's called \"Resist,\" and it's very unfortunate. And I actually said, if we came up with the greatest health care plan or tax cut—because we're coming out with a massive tax cut and tax reform—but if we came up with the greatest health care or tax cut ever in our country's history, we wouldn't get one Democrat vote. It's obstruction.\nSo the Republicans are working hard. We've passed and signed 38 pieces of legislation, which nobody likes to talk about. I think probably seldom has any President and administration done more or had more success so early on, including a record number of resolutions to eliminate job-killing regulations. And we see it all over the country where jobs are starting that would never have started, ever, under any circumstances.\nSo I'd like to thank our great Vice President for being here. I'd like to thank all of the Senators who I have so much respect for. I've gotten to know and love some of them and know and like others. [Laughter] But I have great relationships with every one of them. And I tell you what, I do have a lot of respect for the people in this room, I can tell you that, very much. And I appreciate you being here.\nJust a little bit on the economy. Unemployment has fallen to a 16-year low, and manufacturing confidence is at an alltime high. Just came out with a report: the highest level of confidence in the history of the reports, which are—they've been taking these statistics for many, many years, Mike, I'll tell you. And in the history of this report, the confidence level is at the highest point it's ever been.\nCompanies are moving back into the United States. You see in Michigan where the auto companies are coming back in, and they're expanding their existing plants, and they're saying, well, maybe we're just going to have to build in the United States, and that's the way it's going to be.\nI was also really thrilled, last week—and it had a lot to do with even their opening ceremony—where, in Pennsylvania, they're opening a brandnew coal mine. That's the first coal mine that's opened in this country in a long time. It's brandnew. Many of them are being reopened, but this is a brandnew mine. That hasn't happened for many, many years.\nSo we're keeping our promise to the American people. And that's why it's so important for the Senate and the Senators that are with us today to come up with a great health care plan. And I really believe they're going to be able to do it. We're very close, and I really believe they're going to be able to do it.\nSo the economy is great. The—everything seems to be working really well. And a very big focus for us over the next short period of time are going to be tax cuts, tax reform. We're going to be putting in a very major infrastructure plan. And for this group, in particular, we're going to be focused on Obamacare repeal and replace.\nI've been talking about repealing and replacing Obamacare now for almost 2 years. Don't forget, on June 16—June 14 is my birthday, but June 16 was the day I announced that I was running. Some people said: \"Really? Is that going to happen?\" And it happened. But it's been exactly—so in 3 days, it's exactly 2 years, Joni. So we're very happy about that. And from day one, I said we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. And that's what we're going to do.\nSo we've kept our promises. We've gotten rid of the regulations. The economy is going really well and going to get even a lot better. And our numbers for the quarter are going to be very good, I believe. When the numbers are announced, the GDP numbers, I think they're going to be shockingly good, based on all of the facts that we're hearing and based on the enthusiasm from the businesses, because they're doing well. And we've just started.\nSo I want to thank you all, and I want to thank you Senators for all being here. We appreciate it. And now what we'll do is we'll start talking about the replacement for Obamacare, which will be far better than Obamacare.\nThank you very much.\nHealth Care Reform\nQ. What's your timeframe, Mr. President, your timeline for the replacement bill?\nThe President. As soon as we can do it. As soon as we can do it.\nDepartment of Justice Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III Q. Mr. President, should Robert Mueller be fired?\nThe President. Thank you very much, everybody.\nQ. Should Robert Mueller be fired?\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Millions of American families—and I mean millions—continue to suffer from Obamacare while congressional Democrats obstruct our efforts to rescue them. And I'll tell you, that's exactly what's happening. The Democrats have let you down, big league. Standing beside me are two such families, representing so many others—millions of people—who have been victimized by Obamacare. Terrible law.\nMy thanks to Michael and Tammy Kushman from Marinette County and Robert and Sarah Stoll from Kenosha, as well as their wonderful families, for joining us today. We appreciate it. We appreciate all the people being here. Thank you, folks. They love their country, play by the rules, and work hard to give their loved ones the best life possible.\nMichael Kushman is a proud veteran of the United States Army Medical Service Core. He and his wife Tammy were forced onto Obamacare exchange in 2015, and like countless others, they were shocked to learn that they couldn't keep their doctor as promised. They couldn't keep their plan as promised. They started out paying $600 per month. Then, their insurer quit the exchange, so they had to switch to a new plan, and it went up to $1,000 a month. And it keeps going up and up and up. And that's where we are today. Now it's over $1,400 per month. They've been forced off their plans and onto a new one three times in 3 years. Their premiums have soared 127 percent. The Kushmans now spend nearly one-fourth of their net monthly income on health insurance. So—both of you, both families. Both great families.\nRobert and his wife Sarah Stoll have also endured enormous pain under the crushing burden of Obamacare. Robert serves as a volunteer captain for the Randall Fire Department. He was a small-business owner for 30 years. But their Obamacare premiums doubled, and Sarah was forced to leave retirement and find a part-time job just to pay the bills. When she did so, making matters worse, their new income meant they were no longer eligible for the tax credit they had once received, and the Federal Government actually forced them to repay thousands of dollars.\nThese are sad——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. I agree, that's true. Has it happened to you also? Yes.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Yes, it has. These are sad but familiar stories in Wisconsin, where Obamacare premiums have doubled. Obamacare is one of the greatest catastrophes that our country has signed into law, and the victims are innocent, hard-working Americans like Michael and Tammy, Robert and Sarah. These citizens deserve so much better.\nThe House of Representatives has passed on to the Senate, and the Senate is getting ready to do something—hopefully it will get done—where we will come up with a solution, and a really good one, to health care. No matter how good it is, we will get no obstructionist Democrat votes. No matter how good it is—if it's the greatest health care plan ever devised—we will get zero votes by the obstructionists, the Democrats. It's time to give American families quality, reliable, affordable health care, and that's what we are working very hard to do. And we'll get it done.\nSo I want to thank you, I want to thank the families—[applause]—thank you very much—for being here. And I love being in Wisconsin. I love being in Wisconsin.

This is quite a place, with a beautiful speaker system, I will tell you. [Laughter] We can tell that immediately.\nWell, good afternoon and thank you to my good friend, Governor Scott Walker—tremendous guy, tremendous Governor—for hosting us here in the great State of Wisconsin. It is a great State. I've been here many times since the election.\nI'm also thrilled to be joined by Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta. Thank you, Alex. And Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. We're here today at Waukesha County Technical College to discuss one of the most important questions facing our young people: how to get education and training that they need to find a rewarding and high-paying job.\nWe have a lot of companies moving into the United States, and we're negotiating with a lot of companies. Just backstage, we were negotiating with a major, major, incredible manufacturer of phones and computers and televisions. And I think they're going to give the Governor a very happy surprise very soon.\nDuring my campaign for President, I talked about crucial importance of vocational training: teaching young people the skills, crafts, and trades that are vital to our economy and our success as a country, and their success as an individual. America must not only teach, but celebrate the skilled laborers that produce and maintain the world's greatest machines, buildings, products, and infrastructure, innovations that improve our quality of life, help keep us safe, and have the power to inspire awe and wonder.\nAnd I will say, when I was going to school and I was going to college, that I'd meet people that didn't have a great ability or, frankly, they didn't have a great liking for what they were doing, what they were studying. But they could take apart an engine. They could do drilling like I've never seen before. They could put up a brick wall better than all of the kids in that college or that university, a great school. They could put up a wall in record time and make it far better than anybody else could have done. They just had an amazing ability. And that's what we're about today.\nWe're here today to talk about the dignity of work and the greatness of the American worker and also loving the work you do. I just toured the classrooms, and I must say, they aren't your normal lecture halls, but in a certain way, they're far more beautiful. You learn incredible skills like welding, automotive repair, and machine tool operations. And I looked at the machines, and I'll tell you, what they have is incredible. And the knowledge to operate them is very, very, very amazing. This institution has pioneered the hands-on learning and apprenticeships that produce terrific careers for young Americans.\nGovernor Walker has developed workforce training—very important, workforce training—programs that open up more opportunities for all students, whether they want to go to a 4-year college, a technical college, trade school, or work and learn as a skilled apprentice. I love the name \"apprentice.\" [Laughter] It's a great word. The Governor just announced $3.9 million in grant funds to place 4,300 high school juniors and seniors in apprenticeships in areas like agriculture, health science, hospitality, and engineering.\nWe want a future where every high school in America offers apprenticeship opportunities for young citizens—and studying things that they want to study, and studying things that they're going to be great at. Under this vision, high school students could learn, and they could earn. And, boy, when I say earn, they can make great, great salaries doing something that they love: learn invaluable skills, find a career they love, and enter the workforce faster and without debt.\nTomorrow you'll be hearing more about how my administration is going to expand apprenticeships all throughout the country for young people, and it's called earn while they learn. That's pretty good.\nI look forward to hearing from all of you—especially from the students who are here today, great students—who will tell us about their experience learning some of the most important trades in our Nation. That's what keeps our Nation going. We're going to do everything we can to support you and help more young people have the opportunities we have here in Waukesha County and its incredible County Technical College. I'm very, very impressed with everybody I've met. I'm very, very impressed with the facilities and a lot of very talented people leaving here and going on to something they love and making a fantastic living.\nSo I just want to thank you all. And you have done a wonderful job. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nI'd like to introduce now my daughter Ivanka, who is so strongly committed to what we are here for today. And she's going to say a few words. Thank you very much.\n[At this point, Assistant to the President Ivanka M. Trump and Gov. Scott K.

Authorities are continuing to investigate the crime, and the assailant has now died from his injuries. The FBI is leading the investigation and will continue to provide updates as new information becomes available.\nCongressman Steve Scalise, a member of House leadership, was shot and badly wounded, and is now in stable condition at the hospital, along with two very courageous Capitol Police officers. At least two others were also wounded.\nMany lives would have been lost if not for the heroic actions of the two Capitol Police officers who took down the gunman despite sustaining gunshot wounds during a very, very brutal assault. Melania and I are grateful for their heroism and praying for the swift recovery of all victims.\nCongressman Scalise is a friend and a very good friend. He's a patriot, and he's a fighter. He will recover from this assault. And, Steve, I want you to know that you have the prayers not only of the entire city behind you, but of an entire nation and, frankly, the entire world. America is praying for you, and America is praying for all of the victims of this terrible shooting. I spoke with Steve's wife Jennifer, and I pledged to her our full and absolute support, anything she needs. We are with her and with the entire Scalise family.\nI have also spoken with Chief Matthew Verderosa—he's doing a fantastic job—of the Capitol Police to express our sympathies for his wounded officers and to express my admiration for their courage. Our brave Capitol Police perform a challenging job with incredible skill, and their sacrifice makes democracy possible.\nWe also commend the brave first responders from Alexandria Police, Fire, and Rescue who rushed to the scene. Everyone on that field is a public servant: our courageous police, our congressional aides who work so tirelessly behind the scenes with enormous devotion, and our dedicated Members of Congress who represent our people.\nWe may have our differences, but we do well, in times like these, to remember that everyone who serves in our Nation's Capital is here because, above all, they love our country. We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace, and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good.\nPlease take a moment today to cherish those you love, and always remember those who serve and keep us safe.

Today, we celebrate and recognize June 14 as the day in 1777 when the Continental Congress formally adopted the Stars and Stripes as the official flag of the Republic.\nOur flag is a source of inspiration and strength to all Americans. Wherever Old Glory flies, we remember the six United States Marines raising the flag atop Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting it on the surface of the moon, and our firefighters elevating it above Ground Zero following the terrorist attacks of September 11. At the White House, at our homes, churches, offices, and schools, in our town squares and military installations at home and abroad, our flag celebrates our independence and highlights our resolve to defend and protect the country and the values that we hold dear.\nBy honoring our flag, we pay due respect to the patriots and heroes who have laid down their lives in defense of the liberty it represents. As we raise the flag, we stand and salute or place our hands on our hearts, and we recall the fundamental truths upon which this Nation was founded: that we are all created equal and that just government derives its power from the people.\nI am blessed to have shared my birthday with the Star Spangled Banner and the U.S. Army for 71 years now. Again, on Flag Day, I am deeply grateful to live under the red, white, and blue, and all for which it stands.\nTo commemorate the adoption of our flag, in 1949, the Congress requested the President recognize, by proclamation, that June 14 is \"Flag Day\" and requested the American flag be displayed on all Federal Government buildings. The Congress also requested, in 1966, that the President annually issue a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as \"National Flag Week\" and call upon citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2017, as Flag Day, and this week as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during this week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National Flag Week by displaying the flag. I also encourage the people of the United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

The preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, and affirmed in substantial part by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, bars enforcement of section 2(c) of the Executive Order. The portions of the preliminary injunction entered by the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii that were affirmed by the recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit bar enforcement of certain provisions of sections 2 and 6 of the Executive Order.\nVarious provisions of sections 2 and 6 of the Executive Order (as well as sections 3 and 12(c), which delineate the scope of the suspension contained in section 2(c)), refer to the Order's effective date. Section 14 of the Executive Order provides that the Order was effective at 12:01 a.m., eastern daylight time on March 16, 2017. Sections 2 and 6, however, were enjoined before that effective date, and the courts of appeals have affirmed the injunctions with respect to certain provisions of sections 2 and 6. As a result, under the terms of the Executive Order, the effective date of the enjoined provisions (as well as related provisions of sections 3 and 12(c)) is delayed or tolled until those injunctions are lifted or stayed.\nIn light of questions in litigation about the effective date of the enjoined provisions and in the interest of clarity, I hereby declare the effective date of each enjoined provision to be the date and time at which the referenced injunctions are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision. To the extent it is necessary, this memorandum should be construed to amend the Executive Order.\nBecause the injunctions have delayed the effective date of section 12(c), no immigrant or nonimmigrant visa issued before the effective date of section 2(c) shall be revoked pursuant to the Executive Order.\nI hereby direct the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence to jointly begin implementation of each relevant provision of sections 2 and 6 of the Executive Order 72 hours after all applicable injunctions are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision, to ensure an orderly and proper implementation of those provisions. Prior to that time, consular officers may issue valid visas to, and the Secretary of Homeland Security may admit, otherwise eligible aliens without regard to sections 2 and 6.

Trump\nAMERICAN WORKERS LEFT BEHIND: Many American workers are being left behind as current education and training programs fail to equip them with the skills they need. Apprenticeships will not only keep jobs in America, but ensure that American workers and trained and hired to fill those jobs.\n* Despite many available job vacancies, millions of American workers do not have the opportunity to gain the skills necessary to thrive in a 21st century economy.\n* There are 6 million vacant jobs in the United States, the highest number since 1980.\n* According to a 2014 Georgetown University study, by 2020, some form of education or training beyond high school will be required for 65 percent of all jobs.\n* Instead of getting the skills needed to meet new opportunities, Americans are being left with a pile of debt and, in too many cases, no direct pathway to a stable job.\n* Total student loan debt in the United States is now over $1.4 trillion.\n* The average student loan debt, for students graduating with debt in the class of 2016, is over $30,000.\n* Of total aggregate student loan debt, over 11 percent was over 90 days delinquent or in default.\n* Only 11 percent of employers strongly agree that America's institutions of higher education are teaching graduates the skills their companies need.\n* Many Federal job-training programs are falling short.\n* In fiscal year 2017, the Government funded 43 job-training programs across 13 agencies, totaling $16.7 billion, not counting Pell grants. However, many of these programs do not work and must be reformed.\nOPPORTUNITY FOR AMERICAN WORKERS: President Donald J. Trump is providing opportunity for Americans to gain skills needed to succeed and thrive as the economy grows.\n* President Trump recognizes the value of skill-focused education and is taking steps to create more options for Americans.\n* The Executive Order he is signing today takes important steps to expand apprenticeships and improve job-training programs. The Executive Order:\n* Responds to the desire of third-party groups to create more flexible apprenticeship programs and directs the Department of Labor (DOL) to allow companies, trade associations, and unions to develop their own \"industry-recognized apprenticeship\" guidelines, which DOL will review for quality and then approve.\n* Directs DOL to use available funding to promote apprenticeships, especially in sectors where apprenticeships are not currently widespread.\n* Creates a task force that will recommend ways to promote apprenticeships.\n* Requires all Federal agencies to review and evaluate the effectiveness of their job training programs, and consider how to best consolidate certain programs for increased accountability.\n* Expanding access to apprenticeships will provide American workers with more options and opportunities to get an affordable education and a well-paying job.\n* DOL data shows that over 90% of apprentices find employment after completing their program, and their average starting wage is $60,000 annually.\n* Graduates of apprenticeship programs see a $300,000 lifetime increase in earnings, without the burden of student loan debt.\n* Congress must act to make it easier for Americans to access education that is affordable, teaches relevant skills, and leads to good jobs.\n* Having a degree is not enough; Americans need an education that equips them with the tools to succeed.\n* Job training and higher education programs should be evaluated and reformed to ensure Federal dollars are available for Americans to spend on the courses, programs, and pathways that lead them toward a stable job and a higher paycheck.\nA PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: President Trump is fulfilling his promise to the American people to provide opportunities to succeed as jobs are coming back to the country.\n* On March 17, President Trump said:\n* \"We're training people as the jobs are pouring back in – and they are coming back in big league.\"\n* \"We must embrace new and effective job-training approaches, including online courses, high school curriculums, and private-sector investment that prepare people for trade, manufacturing, technology, and other really well-paying jobs and careers.\"\n* On September 26, 2016, then-candidate Trump said:\n* \"Skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands of miles away. Many Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state despair. This wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class. It doesn't have to be this way. We can turn it all around— and we can turn it around fast.\"\n* \"It will be American hands that remake this country, and it will be American energy - mined from American resources - that powers this country. It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.\"", "timestamp": "2017-06-15", "title": "Press Release - President Trump Leads on Workforce Development"}

And thank you all, I'm truly honored to be with you at this important gathering.\nBut before I begin, allow me to address the attack that took place yesterday in our Nation's Capital.\nPresident Trump and I were deeply saddened when we were informed yesterday morning that a gunman had opened fire on the Republican congressional baseball team, injuring five people as they practiced for tonight's annual charity baseball game.\nI served with many of these congressmen. They're my friends, including Representative Steve Scalise, who was seriously wounded. But I can say with confidence that he continues to receive the best possible medical care at Medstar Hospital in Washington, D.C.\nCongressman Scalise is a good man. He's a principled leader and a patriot. And like all those who come to serve in our Nation's Capital, Steve loves this country, and his service does credit to the people of his state and the people of this nation.\nKaren and I join millions across America in praying for Steve, for all the injured, and their families in this difficult time. But we're especially grateful to the brave police officers who ran into danger without regard to their personal safety.\nAs I told her and her family this morning at the hospital, the courageous actions of Officer Crystal Griner and that of Officer David Bailey saved lives and prevented an even greater tragedy. And the American people are grateful for these courageous police officers. (Applause.)\nWhile there will always be those who seek to divide, who profit from insult over insight -- tonight, on a baseball field in our Nation's Capital, the world will see America is better than that. As President Trump said yesterday, we are strongest when we are unified, when we work together for the common good.\nAnd when a neighbor is hurting or under attack, the American people always come together with generosity, compassion, and prayer. And we always will.\nIt's in that spirit, that I'm honored to stand here with all of you today -- our neighbors, as well, from across North, Central, and South America -- at this historic gathering.\nSo President Hernandez, President Morales, Vice President Ortiz, Secretary Videgaray, Secretary Osorio, members of the Cabinet, honored guests, it is my privilege as Vice President of the United States to welcome you to this Conference on the Prosperity and Security in Central America. (Applause.)\nI bring greetings today from my friend, and a champion of the strong partnership between the United States and Central America, the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump.\nAllow me also to thank Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary John Kelly, and their Departments of State and Homeland Security for their extraordinary efforts in bringing together this historic gathering.\nAllow me to also thank the government of Mexico for their full partnership in making this event possible. Let's give these departments and let's give the government of Mexico a vigorous round of applause. (Applause.)\nI am also grateful for the presence of our Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin. And I want to express my appreciation to the Inter-American Development Bank and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for organizing yesterday's economic event.\nAnd also let me personally thank all the public- and private-sector leaders who traveled to be here from across the Western Hemisphere and Europe.\nBefore such a distinguished group of leaders, today it is my privilege, on President Trump's behalf, to thank President Hernandez, to thank President Morales, and to thank [Vice] President Ortiz for the progress that you have made in the Northern Triangle. We congratulate you and we commend you. (Applause.)\nThank you for your leadership. Thank you for your courage. And thank you for your strong stand and your personal sacrifice to ensure a more secure and prosperous Central America. We couldn't be more grateful.\nSince the founding of the Alliance for Prosperity in 2014, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador have devoted significant resources toward a brighter future for your people.\nYou've courageously pursued the fight against corruption, crime, and drug trafficking. You've undertaken structural reforms to establish a stronger foundation for economic growth; and you are working in close cooperation with regional partners, your business communities, and multinational institutions to implement long-term solutions to the problems facing Central America.\nYour resolve is impressive and know today that you have the great respect of the President of the United States and the American people. (Applause.)\nAnd on behalf of the President, allow me to assure you the United States of America stands with the nations and people of the Northern Triangle. We stand with you in your commitment to root out crime and corruption. We stand with you in your commitment to stop the scourge of drug trafficking once and for all.\nAnd the United States of America stands with you as you build a more secure and prosperous future for the benefit of your people and the benefit of the Western Hemisphere. (Applause.)\nIn a word, we're in this together. As the President has said often, his highest duty as President of the United States is to keep America safe. But this President knows that your security and your prosperity are directly connected to ours.\n? This very gathering is a testament to President Trump's commitment to a stronger, safer, and more prosperous Central America. I'm pleased to announce, at the President's direction, that I'll be traveling to Central and South America later this year to continue to build on the good work being done at this conference. (Applause.)\nThe people of the United States have a special place in our hearts for the nations and the people of Central America, especially in the Northern Triangle of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.\nYour nations experienced your birth of independence when the United States was still in the youth of our own. We are bound together by history and geography. We are bound together by commerce and the nearly $25 billion in goods and services that flow between us every year.\nBut most of all, we are bound together by friendship, by the rich traditions and contributions that the sons and daughters of the Northern Triangle have made to the fabric of American life and make to this day.\n? Be assured, the United States is proud of our strong partnership with nations in the Northern Triangle. We are committed to strengthening that partnership so that we can continue to address the significant problems facing our neighborhood.\nYou sit at the heart of the Western Hemisphere, where North meets South; and every day, countless people and products pass over your streets, through your airports, your seaports, and across your borders. By and large, this flow of commerce and crowds benefits us both in the exchange of culture and goods and services.\nBut as we all know, Central America has been plagued, as well, by vicious gangs and vast criminal organizations that drive illegal immigration and carry illegal drugs on northward their journey to the United States. These criminal syndicates wreak havoc everywhere their tentacles spread, as your people know all too well.\nAt this very moment, there is an estimated 85,000 active gang members in the Northern Triangle alone, and they bring untold misery, corruption, and violence to your communities. One out of every five citizens in this region is a victim of crime every year -- from theft, to extortion, to kidnapping, to human trafficking, or worse.\nBut the consequences of this rampant crime are not restricted to the Northern Triangle. They radiate outward, and swiftly reach us here in the United States. Central America is merely the beginning of a journey for too many migrants fleeing poverty and violence. It's merely a stop on the highway as people confront the merchants of death in the region.\nDriven by the high demand for narcotics here in the United Stated States, fully 80 percent of documented drug traffic travels through Central America -- 80 percent. The American people are reminded of the terrible cost of drug trafficking, gang violence, and illegal immigration every day.\nWe see it in the gangs and violence that plague our streets and cities. We see it in the news with the names of the victims and their families. And we see it on the faces of our families and friends who have fallen prey to the scourge of drug addiction.\nPresident Trump has made it clear that this must end, and under his leadership and yours, this will end. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump has already taken decisive action to protect the American people from the harshest consequences of illegal immigration and the transnational drug trade.\nThis President has ordered the creation of, in his words, an \"aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation,\" and our administration has wasted no time under the leadership of Secretary Kelly in removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals off the streets of America.\nThe President's leadership is already making a difference. Criminal organizations such as MS-13 are being decimated and going directly into prison.\nAnd thanks to President Donald Trump, illegal crossings at America's southern border are down nearly 70 percent since the start of this year. And we are grateful for our partners in Mexico and across the Northern Triangle who have contributed to our progress in this area.\nBut to further stem the flow of illegal immigration and illegal drugs into the United States, President Trump knows, as do all of you, that we must confront these problems at their source. We must meet them -- and we must solve them -- in Central and South America.\n? The United States' partnership with the Northern Triangle is built to accomplish this vital mission. It's what brings us here today. In terms of security, the United States of America is helping train your police forces. We're supporting your attorneys general as they target drug traffickers, gang leaders, and corruption. We're sharing information to better disrupt the flow of weapons and cash into criminal hands.\nThe United States is proud to support programs in the Northern Triangle that strengthen civil society, improve education and literacy, and spur economic growth in impoverished areas.\nAmerican assistance in business development and agriculture in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras in recent years has created more than 40,000 jobs and lifted tens of thousands of families out of poverty.\nRest assured, under the leadership of President Trump, the United States will continue to work with our partners to support the programs that prove effective.\n? Even in this time of fiscal challenges, I'm pleased to report that President Trump has made clear our commitment to this region by requesting an additional $460 million for security and prosperity in Central America. (Applause.)\nBut as you all know, the most important work throughout the region is to be by the nations and the people who call it home. A secure and prosperous Central America requires nothing short of national transformation on an ongoing basis from within -- in the economy, in civil society, in the halls of government. In the Northern Triangle, we ask you with great respect that you maintain and seek to expand your commitment to tackle these problems head on.\nThrough the Alliance for Prosperity, you have already made sustained annual commitments in recent years exceeding $2.8 billion to stimulate growth, improve safety, root out corruption, end the environment of impunity, and enact other important reforms. These are vital investments in your future.\nYet continued action is more necessary now than ever before. On behalf of the President, we urge you to cement the gains that you have made and make renewed progress toward our shared goal of security and prosperity in Central America.\nWorking together, we will continue to build professional and accountable civilian police forces throughout the region. We'll continue to support your campaign against public corruption and to strengthen the rule of law.\nAnd together, we'll continue to provide more people with a path out of poverty -- to give the citizens of Central America a better path and a brighter future. But to accomplish these goals, the nations of Central America must continue to work with new partners -- in the business community, in government, and in the faith community -- to foster stronger and more robust civil societies and economies, to stanch the flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigration, and to combat gang violence and organized crime.\nA flourishing economy gives people a reason to put down roots in the land of their birth and to grow, rather than fleeing to the north. Good-paying jobs give people an alternative to a life of poverty, hopelessness, and crime.\nBy fostering opportunity in the cities and towns of Central America, we'll keep families together. We'll create stronger and more stable communities where your sons and daughters can climb the ladder of success and build a brighter future for themselves, their loved ones, and your nations as a whole.\nThe surest way to make progress toward opportunity and prosperity is for the nations of the Northern Triangle to continue to break down barriers to job creation and growth, to reform their tax and regulatory systems, and to root out corruption at every level of government.\nThis room is proof that businesses also see tremendous opportunity in the Northern Triangle and beyond. Businesses from North and Central America are so well represented here, as are the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.\nThese institutions and industry leaders I can assure you want to partner with your nations to improve the investment climate, to create jobs, to spur the kind of growth that will build a foundation for a brighter future for your nation and for ours.\nAnd on behalf of the President and all the American businesses represented here, I can promise you we want you to grow. We want to export more goods and services to your countries because your success is our success.\nThese are the new and stronger partnerships that'll be necessary for a more prosperous Central America. And a more prosperous Central America, built on a foundation of democracy and the rule of law, will be an inspiration to other nations in this hemisphere and beyond.\nWe need only look to the nation of Venezuela to see what happens when democracy is undermined. That once-rich nation's collapse into authoritarianism has pushed it into poverty and caused untold suffering for the Venezuelan people.\nWe must, all of us, raise our voices to condemn the Venezuelan government for its abuse of power and its abuse of its own people, and we must do it now. (Applause.)\nAnd across the wider region we must show Venezuela and its people that there is a better path -- the path of democracy, of justice, and above all else, we must show Venezuela that freedom is the only path to true prosperity and to a brighter future for their people.\nBut we must always remember that security is the foundation of prosperity. In the Northern Triangle, we must pursue new and stronger partnerships in a word to drive out the criminals, the cartels, the gangs, and all who would undermine a future of peace and safety for your people.\nIt's vital that that the Northern Triangle expand its security cooperation and integration not just with the United States, but also with the other nations of Central America -- Belize, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama.\nSo too must we continue to work closely with Mexico to cripple drug traffickers and disrupt criminal organizations as they seek to travel north. And we cannot overestimate the importance of strong borders. Under President Donald Trump the United States' borders will be strong. But the borders of the United States will always be open to legal immigrants and the lawful flow of commerce. But we will make sure our borders are closed to those who would do us harm -- and it will be impassable to the drugs that are besetting our families and communities.\nToday, we pledge to strengthen the bonds that join the United States, the Northern Triangle, and all the nations of Central America together in this New World.\nLet today mark the beginning of a new era here in the New World -- of partnership and progress throughout our neighborhood for the benefit of all our people.\nAs the Old Book says, let us \"encourage one another and build each other up,\" just as, in fact, we are doing.\nTogether, I know we will build on the foundation of friendship between our lands and between our people. Together, we will reach new heights of safety and security and peace and prosperity. And together, with the help of all the leaders gathered here, with your determination and renewed commitment to the principles that make security and prosperity possible, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God's help, I know we will finish the task before us. We will step forward together in the Western Hemisphere and meet the glorious future that awaits us.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless Central America and God bless the United States of America.

{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126359", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:41 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Since this is our first time formally getting together since the events of yesterday, I wanted to reiterate that the thoughts and prayers of the President and the entire administration are with Congressman Scalise, Agent Griner, Agent Bailey, Matt Mika, and Zack Barth, and all of their friends and family.\nThe President and Vice President have both visited MedStar Washington Hospital Center where Congressman Scalise and Agent Griner are being treated for their injuries. And we continue to monitor all the victims' conditions and pray for their swift and full recovery.\nAs you know, today the President signed an executive order on workforce development. Millions of American workers around the country are being failed by outdated education and training programs that aren't equipping them with the skills they need to take full advantage of the current job opportunities. Think about that: We have millions of Americans looking for work and an estimated 6 million already-existing jobs that need to be filled.\nIn some cases, the only thing standing between them is the skills gap created and reinforced by an education program that hasn't adapted for the 21st century economy.\nPresident Trump is committed to changing that. And a big part of this commitment is providing more opportunities for Americans to gain the skills they need to succeed and thrive, such as apprenticeship programs.\nA few months ago, President Trump and German Chancellor Merkel hosted an important roundtable on how the education system can work in partnership with the private sector to create programs that give students the specific skills they need for the well-paying jobs that are available to them.\nCEOs from American and German companies brought along apprentices from their own companies who shared their success stories with the President. And one of the apprentices, Marie Davis, shared how a unique apprenticeship program in her small town in South Carolina helped her transition from the Air Force to a rewarding career in the manufacturing industry.\nThe President and his daughter Ivanka have heard many stories like Marie's, and that's why he's committed to reforming American education so that more students can come out ready for a job that they want, not just saddled with mounting debt, with no paycheck to pay it down.\nBefore I take your questions, I also wanted to let you know that the President will be traveling to Miami tomorrow to make an announcement on U.S.-Cuba policy. So, if you're in the pool, make sure you bring your sunscreen. I heard it's pretty hot and sunny down there. And with that, I'll take your questions.\nQ: Sarah, yesterday the President stuck to the script in his televised remarks. He didn't lash out at opponents yesterday. He didn't tweet about the Russia investigation. He stuck to a message of unity. That changed this morning with the President's tweets. Why did the President decide to weigh in again on the Russia investigation this morning?\nMS. SANDERS: With regard to weighing in, I think there were some developments yesterday, and he was responding to those things -- stories that came out yesterday afternoon.\nQ: Can I follow up on that? I mean, the stories that came out, actually, were that Mueller was investigating the President for potential obstruction of justice. Given that the White House has been referring questions to Trump's personal lawyers, why is it the President feels like he, personally, should be weighing in on this?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, that's a question -- I know you're not going to like my answer -- but anything specific to the case, you would have to reach out to the President's outside counsel.\nHallie.\nQ: I just have a follow, and then one more question -- and I know you're going to refer a lot of this to outside counsel -- but given the reports that have come out over the last 12 to 18 hours, does the President still feel vindicated?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe so. But again, anything specific to the investigation, I would refer you to Marc Kasowitz and his team.\nQ: And who are the \"bad\" and \"conflicted\" people he mentioned in that tweet?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I would refer you to the President's outside counsel on all questions relating to the investigation.\nQ: Christopher Wray is your pick for the new FBI director. His nomination has not been formally sent over to the Senate. Can you explain what the holdup has been and where that goes from here?\nMS. SANDERS: There's a pretty lengthy paperwork process, I know, that goes with selecting that individual. And so I believe they're in the middle of that process. And as soon as it's completed, it will be sent over.\nQ: Are you talking about security clearance? Or is it --\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know the specific pieces of paperwork that go with that position. I'd be happy to check and get back to you.\nQ: Was that announced too early then? Or was the President appropriate when he announced that?\nMS. SANDERS: Certainly not too early. But again, there's a part of a process that has to take place before the formal paperwork that goes to the Senate goes through.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. If the President is tweeting about the Russia probe, why can't you talk about it from the podium?\nMS. SANDERS: Because I'm not the President.\nQ: Well -- but is there some messaging confusion there? Why can't you come out and answer questions about it if he's tweeting about it? Clearly, he feels comfortable speaking about it.\nMS. SANDERS: I think, again, that there have been very clear guidelines set that we have relayed to you guys multiple times over that anything relating to the investigation, outside the President himself, needs to be referred directly to Marc Kasowitz and his team.\nQ: And let me just try one more time on the tweet -- to Hallie's point -- \"they made up a phony collusion.\" Is that Democrats? Who is that? Who is he referencing?\nMS. SANDERS: Once again, I would refer you to the President's outside counsel.\nQ: Okay. And, Sarah, has anyone at the White House gotten a request from Mueller for any documents related to the investigation?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of, but I'd have to double-check to be sure.\nMike.\nQ: Over the last day, since the shooting occurred yesterday morning, there's been a lot of talk about rhetoric and the extent that political rhetoric in this country may be fueling the kinds of incidents that happen. You saw the President -- it was just referred in the first question -- the President took a real, sort of, unity tone in that first statement, but he returned to the kind of divisiveness and tone that he normally does in the tweets this morning.\nSo I guess the question is, does the White House feel like the President and the White House, more broadly, have any responsibility to adapt a kind of different tone going forward, the way that many of the members on both sides of the aisle are calling for in the last 24 hours?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President was extremely clear yesterday where he thought the rhetoric should lie. And certainly, I -- I'm not sure how you would say that he should own responsibility in any of that.\nQ: Well, I guess, when it comes to a tweet, and not on the substance of the Russia investigation -- but when you call people \"bad people\" and \"witch hunt,\" and sort of attacking -- impugning motives of your adversaries, that's the kind of rhetoric I think that people are talking about.\nMS. SANDERS: I think there's been quite a bit of attacking against the President. I think he was responding to those specific accusations. But I think, as a whole, our country certainly could bring the temperature down a little bit. I think that was the goal that the President laid out yesterday, and hopefully we can all see moving forward.\nJeff.\nQ: Sarah, how does he plan to do that? Does he plan to use this moment as a teachable moment and try and urge people to, beyond the speech yesterday, try and urge people to bring down the heat of the rhetoric here? Or how does he view this as his leadership moment?\nMS. SANDERS: Certainly, I think yesterday was the first step in that process, but I also think by focusing on an agenda that helps empower all of America. That's something he has been very out front and vocal about being a priority, whether it's on education, creating jobs, national security -- it's about protecting and empowering Americans. And so I think you can see the point of unity through his agenda.\nQ: Does he plan to do anything differently, though, in terms of give a speech solely on this or perhaps reach out to Democrats? What specifically does he plan to do different, if anything else?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think the President has tried a lot to reach out to Democrats. He had several members of Congress from the Democrat Party here earlier this week for dinner. I think we'll continue to do things, but I certainly think that as much as we can, we have the opportunity to reach across the aisle -- and we certainly should -- and I think that should go both ways.\nQ: One final thing. Does he still have confidence, or does he have confidence in the special counsel?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe so. Again, I think I made clear earlier this week when I said that he has no intention to make any changes whatsoever on that front.\nQ: You said you didn't know, though, if he had confidence on Air Force One, I think. Do you think he has confidence in Bob Mueller?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had a specific conversation about that, but I think if he didn't he would probably have intentions to make a change and he certainly doesn't.\nQ: The Secret Service says that they have no recordings of the President's conversation while he was in office. Is that case closed for this White House? Does that answer the question of whether there are tapes or not?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I know this is in reference to the Comey conversations and I would refer you to the outside counsel for that.\nQ: Is that then where this answer is going to come from? Because, just a few days ago, the President said he would tell America --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm talking about specific questions regarding that. You could ask them, but I believe the President intends to make it clear at some point. But in terms of questions that you're asking regarding that matter, you'd have to ask outside counsel.\nQ: Should we expect that to happen this week? The President's legal team said on Sunday that it would happen this week.\nMS. SANDERS: Then, again, I would refer to them. If they said it will happen this week, then assume it does.\nQ: Today, the Senate passed new sanctions on Iran and then also on Russia as well. Secretary Tillerson said he felt that he didn't want to be handcuffed by this. White House have a position?\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah, the administration is committed to existing sanctions against Russia and will keep them in place until Moscow fully honors its commitments to resolve the crisis in Ukraine. We believe the existing executive branch sanctions regime is the best tool for compelling Russia to fulfill its commitments.\nQ: Does the White House feel handcuffed, though, in terms of being able to reach out with the Senate action?\nMS. SANDERS: No, right now we're still reviewing the new Russia sanctions amendment. The process is still ongoing. It needs to go through the House, and we don't have a final product yet to weigh in.\nQ: Why has the President decided to give Defense Secretary Jim Mattis authority to increase troop levels in Afghanistan?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the President is simply giving the Secretary of Defense -- this is one piece of a broader cohesive plan for that region -- and he wants to give Secretary Mattis the ability to manage the troops and the resources to do so.\nFor instance, under the current guidelines, you have instances where you send helicopters out without mechanics. He wants to be able to simply remove kind of an arbitrary cap that allows him to manage the forces more accurately.\nQ: How many more troops does the President want to see added to U.S. forces in Afghanistan?\nMS. SANDERS: For anything more specific, I would defer you to Secretary Mattis and his team on that.\nQ: Two questions. First, on executive privilege. About a week ago, you said that in order to facilitate the swift examination of the facts sought by the House Intelligence Committee, President Trump will not assert executive privilege about Jim Comey's testimony. Does that still hold for the Attorney General, Mr. Sessions? Does the President have any reason to invoke executive privilege or say that Mr. Sessions should not answer the questions from the Intelligence Committee?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, there's a longstanding precedent that close advisors to the President keep conversations with the President confidential. This has been respected by both parties. And specifically regarding Attorney General Sessions, there's a DOJ legal opinion protecting conversations between the President and his Attorney General.\nAt the same time, we'll continue to work with congressional committees to accommodate the process to ensure the equities of both branches of government.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two questions today. First --\nMS. SANDERS: That's less than everybody else so far, so --\nQ: Okay, thank you. Last week, Sean put out a very strong statement about the Russian crackdown of dissidents, and this won wide applause from the Russia expatriate community, Mr. Khodorkovsky and Vladimir Kara-Murza, both prominent Russian dissidents. Mr. Kara-Murza called on the President to go a step further and bring up the plight of the hundreds of Russian dissidents who have been jailed in the last few days when he meets with President Putin in Hamburg at the G20 Summit. Does he plan to bring that up?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure. I'd have to check. But as usual standard, we try not to get ahead of conversations that the President may have. But I'm sure we'll provide a readout after they have a conversation, if that takes place.\nQ: My other question --\nMS. SANDERS: Oh, sorry, you did say two.\nQ: Thank you. Was based on -- almost within a period of days after the strong statements from the President and Secretary Tillerson about Qatar, that the United States entered into a $21 billion arms deal with Qatar, and that includes $12 billion, I believe, for fighter aircraft. Does this mean that Qatar is following the U.S. example and cutting back on its ties to those the President considered unacceptable?\nMS. SANDERS: The common security between all the regions is obviously our top priority. Qatar plays an important role in the region by hosting our forces, which are fighting ISIS and other extremist groups. This agreement between the United States and Qatar has been years in the making and is the tangible show of support for our defense relationship and Qatar's commitment to the U.S.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sarah. The President, obviously, based upon his tweets, is not pleased with the investigation that is ongoing by Robert Mueller. Does the President, Sarah, believe it's in his power to shut down that investigation?\nMS. SANDERS: Once again, I would refer all questions regarding the investigation to the President's outside counsel.\nQ: On a separate topic, can you give us a little background about the President's visit with Congressman Scalise last night in the hospital, just beyond what we heard last night from Sean?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't have a lot more to add other than what Sean commented on last night. Obviously, I would imagine it was an emotional time. It was a time the President wanted to show his support for the Congressman, the other victims, and have time to show that publicly and certainly in person with the Congressman's wife.\nQ: Sarah, one logistical one and one policy one. The logistical one is, while I love air conditioning, the fact that it's running and the fact that you're not on speaker is it would be great if we get the transcript because it's going to be really hard to get audio off this.\nAnd the policy one is, does the President plan to nominate a Cuban ambassador, or will he leave that position vacant during his presidency?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure what the plans are for that and specific to any Cuba policy announcement. I'm not going to get ahead of the President's activity that's planned for tomorrow, and so I don't know if that will be addressed. If not, we can try to follow up next week.\nQ: Sarah, on Bob Mueller, is there anything you can tell us more about when he came in to interview for the job, what the President was looking at offering him? Was it acting FBI director? Was it actually FBI director? Why didn't the White House tell us more about that at the time when you did announce other people who were coming in for the director job?\nMS. SANDERS: My understanding is he was actually here the day before he was named as a special counsel. In terms of specific job, whether it was acting or permanent, I'm not sure, and I'd have to check and get back to you.\nQ: But it was a job interview?\nMS. SANDERS: That's my understanding, yes.\nQ: And does the White House believe that that presents any kind of conflict, that sequence of events you just described? The day before he's supposed to be the independent, outside counsel, he was meeting, presumably, with the President directly to talk about --\nMS. SANDERS: No, since that's something he wouldn't have been aware of.\nQ: Sorry, the President wasn't aware of --\nMS. SANDERS: Wouldn't have been aware of the naming of a special counsel at that time.\nQ: So it's not a conflict?\nMS. SANDERS: Right.\nSorry, you've been skipped over a couple of times.\nQ: I know, I keep thinking it's me and then someone else answers.\nMS. SANDERS: So credit me for constantly --\nQ: Thank you, I appreciate it. So a couple of political things. Virginia had its elections the other day. That's the biggest -- big election of this year. I'm wondering if the President would campaign for the Republican nominee for governor, or any of the nominees; if he's spoken to Ed Gillespie, if they've had any conversation or any plans to do anything together.\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of any conversations that have taken place, and whether or not there will be activities. We certainly would keep you guys posted if that was to happen.\nQ: And you don't know if he would campaign for him later in the year?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know if that's been discussed. I can't comment.\nQ: How about next week for the final week of the Georgia election? Any other --\nMS. SANDERS: Plans for him to go? Not that I'm aware of at this point.\nQ: He wouldn't do anything? Calls?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'd have to double-check to let you know. I believe the Vice President has done something on behalf of the candidate there, but I would have to check to see if there are further activities planned.\nQ: Two questions on healthcare. Is anything the President would be willing to see happen in the Senate bill that would make it more palatable to conservatives? Because right now, centrist Republicans seem to be pushing more in the direction that's (inaudible) for them --\nMS. SANDERS: I think he certainly would be open to things that make the bill better. I think he's been very clear about that from the beginning. He knows Obamacare isn't sustainable, and this is a big priority for him to get a better and more sustainable healthcare system in place.\nQ: Specifically, is it better for them?\nMS. SANDERS: I'd have to check on actual specific details that might be better for conservatives. I'm not aware of the back-and-forth conversations that they've been having.\nQ: And on cost-sharing reductions, has the President made a decision yet -- has the White House made a decision yet on whether it will pay the cost-sharing reduction subsidies for the month of June?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know if there's been a decision on that made yet. But we'll keep you posted.\nQ: Who from the administration is planning on going to the baseball game tonight? And is there any other message to people that -- the teams that are playing, players in the game?\nMS. SANDERS: I think, to kind of echo what the President said yesterday, I think this provides a great moment of unity to see members from both parties come out and have that time together, without conflict, on a baseball field, and enjoy a night like that. I believe there are several members from the administration that are planning to attend. But as far as specifics, I'm not sure of that right now.\nThanks so much, guys.\nEND 2:00 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 11:19 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma; House Majority Whip Stephen J. Scalise, U.S. Capitol Police Special Agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey, and Tyson Foods Washington Director of Government Relations Matt Mika, who were wounded in the shootings at the Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, VA, on June 14; Secretary of Labor R. Alexander Acosta; Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr.; and Assistant to the President Ivanka M. Trump.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126332", "text": "The President. Hello, everybody. Mary. Hello, everybody. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for all being here. Before beginning today, I'd like to take a moment to again send our thoughts and prayers to my friend—and the friend of most of us in this room—Steve Scalise, and his great family as he continues his very brave fight.\nIt's been much more difficult than people even thought at the time. It's been—he's in some trouble, but he's a great fighter and he's going to be okay, we hope.\nI visited Steve and his family at the hospital last night, and I reassured them that the entire country is pulling for them, praying for them, and that we are here for them every single step of the way. America's hearts—and we mean this in the truest sense—sends its love. We've got a lot of hearts in this country, great hearts, and they're all sending their love and support to the Scalise family.\nAnd Steve, in his own way, may have brought some unity to our long-divided country. We've had a very, very divided country for many years. And I have a feeling that Steve has made a great sacrifice, but there could be some unity being brought to our country. Let's hope so.\nWhile at the hospital, I also visited with Special Agent Crystal Griner—terrific young woman—of the Capitol Police and her family. Crystal is one of the two Capitol Police officers who saved so many lives through her heroism, along with Special Agent David Bailey. They ran right into the fire. They ran right into those guns and the bullets, and they saved a lot of lives. America salutes both of their courage. They have great, great courage. We all salute them.\nWe also salute the men and women of the Alexandria Police, Fire, and Rescue, and all of the first responders. The timing and speed and the professionalism was incredible. They performed with bravery and with skill.\nFinally, our heartfelt prayers go out to Matt Mika, who was badly wounded in the assault. To Matt's family: Anything you need, we are here for you. Hopefully, Matt will be okay.\nIn these difficult hours, it's more important than ever to help each other, care for each other, and remind each other that we are all united by our love of our great and beautiful country.\nWe're joined today by Secretary Acosta, Secretary Ross, and Administrator McMahon as we prepare to make a historic announcement to train Americans for the jobs of the future. We have a lot of companies moving into this country. You see the unemployment rate is at a very, very low level. Job enthusiasm and manufacturing, business enthusiasm is at record levels—never been higher. And a lot of good numbers are coming out, including almost $4 trillion in gain to the stock markets and—since the election—$4 trillion. We just signed a big deal yesterday for hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of equipment and military equipment going to be made in this country, in our country, for other countries.\nWe've got it going. We have to make sure the people are here and they're going to be well trained. So I want to thank my daughter Ivanka and her leadership. She has worked so hard on this. She understands how important it is. We're training people to have great jobs and high-paying jobs.\nAnd we're here today to celebrate the dignity of work—it's really a good term—dignity of work—and the greatness of the American worker, which I've been celebrating for a long time. Probably wouldn't be here if it weren't for the American worker.\nAnd the American worker sees what's happening in Michigan and in Ohio and in a lot of places that we've had a huge impact on just in a short period of time that I've been here and this administration has been involved. We have a lot of companies moving in, a lot of plants are going to be built. A lot of plants are being expanded, and big ones are going to be announced very soon. You're going to hear some very big names that I can't tell you about now. We want to get them signed on the dotted line. [Laughter] We don't want to talk too quickly. It's called \"sign them on the dotted line,\" right? [Laughter]\nIn just a few moments, I'll be signing an Executive order to expand apprenticeships and vocational training to help all Americans find a rewarding career, earn a great living, and support themselves and their families and love going to work in the morning.\nWe will be removing Federal restrictions that have prevented many different industries from creating apprenticeship programs. We have regulations on top of regulations. And in history, nobody has gotten rid of so many regulations at the Trump administration. And that's one of the reasons that you see the jobs and the companies all kicking in so strongly. I think some very good numbers are going to be announced, by the way, in the very near future as to GDP.\nSo we're empowering these companies, these unions, industry groups, Federal agencies to go out and create new apprenticeships for millions of our citizens. Apprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of traditional 4-year college degrees. Instead, apprentices earn while they learn, which is an expression we're using: Earn while you learn.\nWe're joined today by apprentices who know firsthand how these programs can bring new hope and new opportunities. We're also joined by some of the country's great Governors, and I appreciate them very, very much from being here—for being here. We just had a meeting in the Cabinet Room.\nCharles Robel is here with us from Wisconsin, where I just left, actually, yesterday. I was with Governor Walker. Charles is a three-time combat veteran who bravely served our Nation, highly respected. After Charles came back from the war, he, like so many other Americans, faced very tough economic times.\nCharles began taking machine tool operation courses from a technical college. He immediately excelled. He was really, really good at it, they say. [Laughter] That's what they say. I haven't checked. [Laughter] Where is Charles?\nWaukesha County Technical College student apprentice Charles Robel. I think I'm doing okay, Mr. President.\nThe President. Come here. [Laughter] Charles, they tell me. I haven't checked it. I want to check you out, all right? [Laughter] But he immediately excelled. And by the end of his yearlong apprenticeship, Charles will be making more than $60,000 a year and going up a lot higher than that. And he loves what he does. I think you really love it, right? Mr. Robel. Yes, sir.\nThe President. Yes, loves it. Charles, we thank you for your service to a country—to our country, both in the military and in exactly what you're doing right now, which is so important. And we congratulate you on this exciting new career, and you're going to have some great future. Thank you, Charles, appreciate it.\nEach of the apprentices here today has their own story and their own dreams—that's what they are—dreams. Apprenticeships teach striving Americans the skills they need to operate incredible machines. And some of these machines are so intricate, so powerful, and really—the word is—they are incredible. This is not the old days; this is new and computerized and complicated, and you really have to know what you're doing. But they create amazing products. And to construct skyscrapers that touch the clouds. I mean, you look at the equipment today, and just go back 10 years ago and 20 years ago, it's from a different world, from a different planet. It's incredible.\nI just met with the Governors from many of the States to discuss how we can work with them to expand apprenticeships and the apprentice programs. I'm also delighted to be here with CEOs of major companies who support our apprenticeship initiatives. And we had a tremendous number of the biggest CEOs in the world here yesterday. And we talked about this also, and they are fully behind it, including our effort to help millions of talented young American women thrive and flourish in our economy.\nWe are thrilled, as well, to have with us today Congressman Bobby Scott and Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, who care so deeply about this effort. Thank you. Thank you both.\nThe strength of our Nation will be determined by our ability to keep jobs in America, and we're going to keep them in America. You're not going to have companies fleeing like in the past. There's going to be a big price to pay for companies that want to leave, fire their workers, build a plant outside of this country, and think they're going to sell their product right back into the United States. There's going to be a big price to pay.\nBut we want to keep jobs in America, and we want to train people and hire American workers to fill those jobs. And that's exactly what we're doing, and we're being—we're really doing a job of it. And I just want to thank all of our Secretaries and everybody involved in the process.\nNot only will our apprentices transform their lives, but they will also transform our lives in the truest sense. Today's apprentices will construct the roads and bridges that move our citizens, they will bend the metal and steel that shape our cities, and they will pioneer the new technology that drives our commerce.\nBut as we train the next generation of Americans to do their jobs, all of us here today have to do our jobs: We have to join forces, join hands, and join together to restore the American Dream for all of our people.\nAnd one of the parts of the American Dream is, we're going to come down very, very hard—and we already have; you've seen what's going on the border—on this massive drug problem that we have in the United States and, frankly, that other countries have also. And we're coming down very, very hard on it. And if we don't, it's called shame on us. So everybody that has worked so hard on this program and everybody in this room, including the reporters, God bless you—[laughter]—God bless America. And let's go out, and let's do a really terrific job with the apprentice program.\nThank you very much. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nCome on, gather around, everybody. Gather around. This is a big one. Right, Linda?\nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration Linda E. McMahon. Yes, sir.\n[At this point, the President signed the Executive order.]\nThe President. Where is he?\nRepresentative Virginia A. Foxx. Charles, right here.\nThe President. Come on, Charles. Charles, right, Matt? Give it to Charles? Matt says give it to Charles.\nGov. Matthew G. Bevin of Kentucky. I'd say so.\nMr. Robel. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you very much, everybody.\nQ. Mr. President, do you believe that you are under investigation now?", "timestamp": "2017-06-15", "title": "Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Expanding Apprenticeships in America"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "This Executive order was published in the  Federal Register  on June 20.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126333", "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to promote affordable education and rewarding jobs for American workers, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1. Purpose. America's education systems and workforce development programs are in need of reform. In today's rapidly changing economy, it is more important than ever to prepare workers to fill both existing and newly created jobs and to prepare workers for the jobs of the future. Higher education, however, is becoming increasingly unaffordable. Furthermore, many colleges and universities fail to help students graduate with the skills necessary to secure high-paying jobs in today's workforce. Far too many individuals today find themselves with crushing student debt and no direct connection to jobs.\nAgainst this background, federally funded education and workforce development programs are not effectively serving American workers. Despite the billions of taxpayer dollars invested in these programs each year, many Americans are struggling to find full-time work. These Federal programs must do a better job matching unemployed American workers with open jobs, including the 350,000 manufacturing jobs currently available.\nExpanding apprenticeships and reforming ineffective education and workforce development programs will help address these issues, enabling more Americans to obtain relevant skills and high-paying jobs. Apprenticeships provide paid, relevant workplace experiences and opportunities to develop skills that employers value. Additionally, they provide affordable paths to good jobs and, ultimately, careers.\nFinally, federally funded education and workforce development programs that do not work must be improved or eliminated so that taxpayer dollars can be channeled to more effective uses.\nSec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to provide more affordable pathways to secure, high-paying jobs by promoting apprenticeships and effective workforce development programs, while easing the regulatory burden on such programs and reducing or eliminating taxpayer support for ineffective workforce development programs.\nSec. 3. Definitions. For purposes of this order:\n(a) the term \"apprenticeship\" means an arrangement that includes a paid-work component and an educational or instructional component, wherein an individual obtains workplace-relevant knowledge and skills; and\n(b) the term \"job training programs\" means Federal programs designed to promote skills development or workplace readiness and increase the earnings or employability of workers, but does not include Federal student aid or student loan programs.\nSec. 4. Establishing Industry-Recognized Apprenticeships. (a) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary), in consultation with the Secretaries of Education and Commerce, shall consider proposing regulations, consistent with applicable law, including 29 U.S.C. 50, that promote the development of apprenticeship programs by third parties. These third parties may include trade and industry groups, companies, non-profit organizations, unions, and joint labor-management organizations. To the extent permitted by law and supported by sound policy, any such proposed regulations shall reflect an assessment of whether to:\n(i) determine how qualified third parties may provide recognition to high-quality apprenticeship programs (industry-recognized apprenticeship programs);\n(ii) establish guidelines or requirements that qualified third parties should or must follow to ensure that apprenticeship programs they recognize meet quality standards;\n(iii) provide that any industry-recognized apprenticeship program may be considered for expedited and streamlined registration under the registered apprenticeship program the Department of Labor administers;\n(iv) retain the existing processes for registering apprenticeship programs for employers who continue using this system; and\n(v) establish review processes, consistent with applicable law, for considering whether to:\n(A) deny the expedited and streamlined registration under the Department of Labor's registered apprenticeship program, referred to in subsection (a)(iii) of this section, in any sector in which Department of Labor registered apprenticeship programs are already effective and substantially widespread; and\n(B) terminate the registration of an industry-recognized apprenticeship program recognized by a qualified third party, as appropriate.\n(b) The Secretary shall consider and evaluate public comments on any regulations proposed under subsection (a) of this section before issuing any final regulations.\nSec. 5. Funding to Promote Apprenticeships. Subject to available appropriations and consistent with applicable law, including 29 U.S.C. 3224a, the Secretary shall use available funding to promote apprenticeships, focusing in particular on expanding access to and participation in apprenticeships among students at accredited secondary and post-secondary educational institutions, including community colleges; expanding the number of apprenticeships in sectors that do not currently have sufficient apprenticeship opportunities; and expanding youth participation in apprenticeships.\nSec. 6. Expanding Access to Apprenticeships. The Secretaries of Defense, Labor, and Education, and the Attorney General, shall, in consultation with each other and consistent with applicable law, promote apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships for America's high school students and Job Corps participants, for persons currently or formerly incarcerated, for persons not currently attending high school or an accredited post-secondary educational institution, and for members of America's armed services and veterans. The Secretaries of Commerce and Labor shall promote apprenticeships to business leaders across critical industry sectors, including manufacturing, infrastructure, cybersecurity, and health care.\nSec. 7. Promoting Apprenticeship Programs at Colleges and Universities. The Secretary of Education shall, consistent with applicable law, support the efforts of community colleges and 2-year and 4-year institutions of higher education to incorporate apprenticeship programs into their courses of study.\nSec. 8. Establishment of the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion. (a) The Secretary shall establish in the Department of Labor a Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion. (b) The mission of the Task Force shall be to identify strategies and proposals to promote apprenticeships, especially in sectors where apprenticeship programs are insufficient. The Task Force shall submit to the President a report on these strategies and proposals, including:\n(i) Federal initiatives to promote apprenticeships;\n(ii) administrative and legislative reforms that would facilitate the formation and success of apprenticeship programs;\n(iii) the most effective strategies for creating industry-recognized apprenticeships; and\n(iv) the most effective strategies for amplifying and encouraging private-sector initiatives to promote apprenticeships.\n(c) The Department of Labor shall provide administrative support and funding for the Task Force, to the extent permitted by law and subject to availability of appropriations.\n(d) The Secretary shall serve as Chair of the Task Force. The Secretaries of Education and Commerce shall serve as Vice-Chairs of the Task Force. The Secretary shall appoint the other members of the Task Force, which shall consist of no more than twenty individuals who work for or represent the perspectives of American companies, trade or industry groups, educational institutions, and labor unions, and such other persons as the Secretary may from time to time designate.\n(e) Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), may apply to the Task Force, any functions of the President under that Act, except for those of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Chair, in accordance with guidelines issued by the Administrator of General Services.\n(f) Members of the Task Force shall serve without additional compensation for their work on the Task Force, but shall be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, to the extent permitted by law for persons serving intermittently in the Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707), consistent with the availability of funds.\n(g) A member of the Task Force may designate a senior member of his or her organization to attend any Task Force meeting.\n(h) The Task Force shall terminate 30 days after it submits its report to the President.\nSec. 9. Excellence in Apprenticeships. Not later than 2 years after the date of this order, the Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, and in consultation with the Secretaries of Education and Commerce, establish an Excellence in Apprenticeship Program to solicit voluntary information for purposes of recognizing, by means of a commendation, efforts by employers, trade or industry associations, unions, or joint labor-management organizations to implement apprenticeship programs.\nSec. 10. Improving the Effectiveness of Workforce Development Programs. (a) Concurrent with its budget submission to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the head of each agency shall submit a list of programs, if any, administered by their agency that are designed to promote skills development and workplace readiness. For such programs, agencies shall provide information on:\n(i) evaluations of any relevant data pertaining to their effectiveness (including their employment outcomes);\n(ii) recommendations for administrative and legislative reforms that would improve their outcomes and effectiveness for American workers and employers; and\n(iii) recommendations to eliminate those programs that are ineffective, redundant, or unnecessary.\n(b) The Director of OMB shall consider the information provided by agencies in subsection (a) of this section in developing the President's Fiscal Year 2019 Budget.\n(c) The head of each agency administering one or more job training programs shall order, subject to available appropriations and consistent with applicable law, an empirically rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of such programs, unless such an analysis has been recently conducted. When feasible, these evaluations shall be conducted by third-party evaluators using the most rigorous methods appropriate and feasible for the program, with preference given to multi-site randomized controlled trials.\n(d) The Director of OMB shall provide guidance to agencies on how to fulfill their obligations under this section.\nSec. 11. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

ANTON: Just to reiterate the ground rules: You've got a senior administration official who will speak on background as a senior administration official. For those getting the audio in the White House, this is just for information only. It is not be used for broadcast on radio or TV.\nWith that, I will turn it over to our SAO.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Good afternoon -- I suppose it's noon now. Good to see you. I'll take a question or two here off the record, if I can. But on the record, with respect to the reporting on the -- reported killing of al-Baghdadi today, my answer would be no comment.\nQ: So you are aware of the reports?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: That's correct. I'm aware of the reports. Senior leadership here at the White House and the President have been made aware of the reports, and my official answer now is no comment.\nQ: Are you in touch with the Russians on those reports? Have you spoken with your Russian counterparts?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: If we could, just as a ground rule -- all I'm prepared to say on the record is no comment.\nBut if I can then switch to off the record answers --\nQ: Off the record, meaning background as senior White House official?\nQ: You mean you want to go just completely off the record?\nMR. ANTON: Background as an SAO.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So let me do background as an SAO then for a minute before I take your questions. A couple of reasons for the \"no comment\" that I would put into your thinking here would be that we've seen a number of, and a pattern of, claims from Syria, Russia, and others who have various different motives and intentions for making such claims wrongly, or quickly and inaccurately.\nAnd what we want to make sure we do is maintain our credibility as a government, not only with the media, but with our world partners, allies, and enemies alike so as to not informally or incorrectly corroborate such a claim.\nAt this point, the claims seem to have a number of infirmities that made me nervous and would ask for actual reflections from our intelligence community, and I'm not prepared to give you that report yet because I don't have it.\nSome of those infirmities suggested that this happened at the end of May and that there were upwards of 300 or more soldiers killed in that strike. That's the type of magnitude that we would think we would have already seen reflections of, and at least to my knowledge, we weren't aware of.\nAnd so a strike of that size and that claim that would have happened that long ago without any knowledge is something that made me curious and specious of the claim. And then the track record, really, and pattern of previously incorrect claims made me nervous.\nAnd then, lastly, as the other side of that coin, after the U.S. killed Adnani, we had seen that reported by the Russians and Syrians within days. And so the fact that this has gone for weeks just made me a little bit careful.\nSo that's why for now it's no comment.\n(Goes off the record.)\n(Returns on the record.)\nSo that's it for the prepared part.\nAnd I think, to your question, I have not been in contact with any other government other than my own U.S. government partners, so I can't speak for, honestly, as we're on the plane, whether any of our intelligence community has talked to their counterparts in Russia.\nI know that our officials on the ground are aware -- in other words, our diplomats and our military forces on the ground in Syria and elsewhere. And our State Department officials are already on the highest of heightened security postures because of Ramadan and the higher threat that accompanies it. So there would be nothing to do to increase our security posture for U.S. interests for a potential retaliatory strike, which lessens my urgency on determining whether the claim is true.\nQ: For the new Cuba policy, does that have anything to do with --\nMR. ANTON: I'll see if I can get my colleague.\nQ: I'm just wondering if you're worried about Cuba being a staging ground for terrorists and that's part of the reason for the new policy.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The only thing I'll say on the Cuba policy here, for what it's worth, is that the continuation of no wet foot, dry foot policy, of the ending of that policy is a good thing for not only the people who end being put in harm's way, but for our border security.\nAnd outside of that, I am going to leave H.R. and the President, and Senator Rubio and others to do most of the talking on the Cuba policy today.\nThank you very much. Thanks, all.\n* * * *\nMR. ANTON: Look, I can't talk about stuff beyond the NSC purview that I have. So for DACA, I've got to refer you to the White House Press Office, which everybody is there.\n(Goes off the record.)\n(Returns on the record.)\nQ: On the Cuba announcement today, you guys are doing it during a meeting of a lot of Latin American leaders who have been against changing the Obama administration policy. Some might see this as a slap in the face to them during this meeting. Why the timing?\nMR. ANTON: The timing -- there's nothing intentional about the timing. It's not a slap in the face. This is something -- we hope we can get support from other Latin American leaders for this policy, and we'll be -- we think this is a policy that favors the Cuban people over and against an oppressive regime. And we hope that we can garner other support from leaders in the region.\nQ: Mike, explain the significance of the location. The theater is named after the man who led the Bay of Pigs invasion. There's the notion that this is provocative.\nMR. ANTON: The President spoke at this same location in October of 2016 in a campaign event. He was also the only presidential candidate ever endorsed by this group of either party in any election. He was grateful for that endorsement. He's inspired by the courage shown by the leaders of the Bay of Pigs invasion, and he's honored to go back and stand with them again to make this announcement.\nQ: The changes that are being talked about seem relatively small compared to what you could have done. How is that going to -- are the folks going to be happy with that?\nMR. ANTON: I don't think I would classify them as small. I think the changes are very targeted, and the changes are specific, and they have a clear intent, which is to put pressure on the regime and to support the people. That's why the embassy, for instance, will remain open. That's why -- travel will remain permitted, but travel will be permitted that's consistent with U.S. law and that falls under one of the 12 categories that we think are intended to help develop civil society, develop a free economy, develop a private sector, small businesses, and so on.\nQ: The President said in a statement today that he was under investigation. How was he made aware of that?\nMR. ANTON: I going to refer you to the White House Press Office.\nQ: Michael, if you're an American wanting to travel to Cuba, what will you need to do before going?\nMR. ANTON: Well, as I said, there are 12 categories of permissible travel under the law. The regulations will be in the process of being changed after this policy takes effect once the President signs it today.\nWe don't have a hard date for when all of those regulations will be published. Some will be published by Treasury, some by the State Department. You will need to consult with those agencies to figure out whether your specific trip and purpose are permissible under the law.\nQ: How do you square the President's focus on human rights in Cuba with his apparent lack of interest in human rights in other countries.\nMR. ANTON: I dispute that he has a lack of interest in human rights in other countries. It's true that the President approaches the question of human rights in different ways, depending on the relationship the United States has with a particular country. For instance, the United States has a strong security relationship with Egypt. The President was proud to welcome President el-Sisi of Egypt to the White House, where he discussed in private his concerns about human rights. And very shortly thereafter, the Egyptians released an American they had held for -- if I recall correctly -- nearly three years.\nSo he takes a different tack depending on the nature of the relationship between the two countries, but his concern is consistent no matter what the country.\nQ: -- in his speech -- just what we're expected to hear today from him?\nMR. ANTON: I think you're going to hear strong support for the Cuban people, a strong condemnation of the regime and its practices, and an outline of what the policy does and is intended to do.\nQ: Is he going to list the benchmarks that Cuba needs to do for better relations with the United States?\nMR. ANTON: I wouldn't call it a list, but he will certainly refer to the policy change that he would like to see the Cuban regime take.\nQ: And what are those?\nMR. ANTON: Great political and economic freedom. I would say everything that he's asking for is lumped under those categories. He will call for them to release political prisoners. He will call for them to return U.S. fugitives from justice back to the United States so that they can face justice in the United States. He will call for Cuba to liberalize its economy, to strengthen the private sector, and to take steps toward greater democratic participation for its people.\nQ: Do you expect the policy to change which hotels Americans will be able to, under the law, to stay in in Cuba? In which hotels --\nMR. ANTON: Hotels, but also not just hotels, also other businesses that are linked to the military, the intelligence services and the Cuban security apparatus will not permissible to transact business with. And that's one of the things that's going to be worked out as the regulations are finalized.\nThe State Department will eventually be publishing lists that make that clear where people -- what's permissible and what's not permissible.\nQ: Can you address what the administration is doing to get to the bottom of what happened to Otto Warmbier in North Korea and how it is that he was returned to the U.S. in a coma?\nMR. ANTON: I can't say anything, I think, beyond what we have said about it. I think we've given some detailed information about the discussions that led to that release. And I think you also know that the President spoke to the family, I guess, two evenings ago now. But the family has asked for privacy beyond that, and so we're just not commenting further than that.\nQ: But is the U.S. satisfied with the explanation that North Korea gave that it was botulism and then a sleeping pill that led to his current condition?\nMR. ANTON: I don't have anything further about that. I think we are glad that Otto is home with his family. We're certainly very concerned about his current status. And we're trying to respect the family's wishes for privacy beyond that.\nQ: Michael, is the President willing to have talks with the Cuban leadership?\nMR. ANTON: Well, look, the United States talks to the Cuban government and we're keeping the embassy open, as I've noted. So those talks will continue. In terms of higher-level talks, there's no discussion of that at this time, but our government remains open to speaking at higher levels if we see progress toward the goals that the President has outlined. But I'm not going to prejudge that or promise anything or set specific conditions for which leader at which level might speak.\nQ: Why will these changes help bring about change in Cuba when decades of a full embargo did not change significantly the human rights record?\nMR. ANTON: Well, our hope is that these people-to-people contacts that are allowed under specific rules and the ability of Americans to travel there and meet Cubans, directly support Cuban small businesses, directly support Cuban private enterprise, directly support dissidents will strengthen the Cuban private sector, strengthen Cuban civil society, and lead to popular pressure for positive change.\nQ: Does that mean you agree, essentially, with the Obama administration's posture toward Cuba, even though you're refining the policy? Because those are similar arguments that they made.\nMR. ANTON: No, I think the President was very, very clear that he thinks the Obama administration's deal wasn't much of a deal at all. It was the United States giving the Cuban regime most, if not all, of what it had wanted for the past half-a-century without getting anything in return for the Cuban people. And this policy is a necessary change to address the deficiencies that the President outlined in the Obama policy.\nQ: Can you tell us who is aboard?\nMR. ANTON: Senator Rubio is aboard. Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart is aboard. Secretary Perdue, of Agriculture, is aboard. Secretary Ross, Commerce. Secretary Acosta of Labor. And Representative Curbelo -- I hope I didn't pronounce that wrong. Those are the -- aside from the senior staff, those are the -- so we have three members of Congress and I guess three Cabinet Secretaries.\nQ: Is Reince on the plane?\nMR. ANTON: Reince is not on the plane.\nQ: Will the President do anything in Miami besides the speech and signing the directive?\nMR. ANTON: He will meet with veterans of the Bay of Pigs and some -- there's a private meet-and-greet that's not open press with some Cuban --\nQ: From the group that endorsed him last year?\nMR. ANTON: And other Cuban-American leaders in Miami.\nQ: Will anybody from the administration today be able to answer questions on DACA and DAPA and the President's statements regarding the investigation?\nMR. ANTON: I would refer you, again, back to the White House Press Office, which is fully manned and ready to take your questions.\nThanks.\nEND 12:18 P.M.

(Applause.)\nWelcome to a historic day, a day when America will renew our commitment to the ideal of freedom in this hemisphere, a day when the world will witness America once again standing in solidarity with the people of Cuba thanks to the strong and unwavering leadership of President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nIt is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to President Donald Trump -- a man of his word, a man of action, and a President who stands without apology as leader of the free world. (Applause.)\nSince the hour of our nation's birth, the United States has stood for the proposition that all are created equal, that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights -- life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. (Applause.)\nAs Americans we believe these rights belong to the entire human family. But for 58 years the people of Cuba have labored under a repressive regime that has stifled their liberty and with it, their future.\nFor generations, the sons and daughters of Cuba have come to our shores in search of the freedom that their friends and family at home are denied.\nBut while you came to the land of the free, you never forgot home. You raised your voices through the generations to demand that Cuba be free once more -- and once again, you have a President who hears you and is with you.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126489", "text": "President Donald J. Trump is changing the policy of the United States toward Cuba to achieve four objectives:1. Enhance compliance with United States law—in particular the provisions that govern the embargo of Cuba and the ban on tourism;\n2. Hold the Cuban regime accountable for oppression and human rights abuses ignored under the Obama policy;\n3. Further the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and those of the Cuban people; and\n4. Lay the groundwork for empowering the Cuban people to develop greater economic and political liberty.\nSummary of Key Policy Changes:\n* The new policy channels economic activities away from the Cuban military monopoly, Grupo de Administraciуn Empresarial (GAESA), including most travel-related transactions, while allowing American individuals and entities to develop economic ties to the private, small business sector in Cuba. The new policy makes clear that the primary obstacle to the Cuban people's prosperity and economic freedom is the Cuban military's practice of controlling virtually every profitable sector of the economy. President Trump's policy changes will encourage American commerce with free Cuban businesses and pressure the Cuban government to allow the Cuban people to expand the private sector.\n* The policy enhances travel restrictions to better enforce the statutory ban on United States tourism to Cuba. Among other changes, travel for non-academic educational purposes will be limited to group travel. The self-directed, individual travel permitted by the Obama administration will be prohibited. Cuban-Americans will be able to continue to visit their family in Cuba and send them remittances.\n* The policy reaffirms the United States statutory embargo of Cuba and opposes calls in the United Nations and other international forums for its termination. The policy also mandates regular reporting on Cuba's progress—if any—toward greater political and economic freedom.\n* The policy clarifies that any further improvements in the United States-Cuba relationship will depend entirely on the Cuban government's willingness to improve the lives of the Cuban people, including through promoting the rule of law, respecting human rights, and taking concrete steps to foster political and economic freedoms.\n* The policy memorandum directs the Treasury and Commerce Departments to begin the process of issuing new regulations within 30 days. The policy changes will not take effect until those Departments have finalized their new regulations, a process that may take several months. The Treasury Department has issued Q&As that provide additional detail on the impact of the policy changes on American travelers and businesses.", "timestamp": "2017-06-16", "title": "Press Release - Fact Sheet on Cuba Policy"}

In the address, the President referred to James T. Hodgkinson, suspected gunman in the shootings at the Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, VA, on June 14; House Majority Whip Stephen J. Scalise and his wife Jennifer; Matt Mika, Washington director of government relations for Tyson Foods, and Zachary Barth, a staffer for Rep. Roger Williams, who were wounded in the shootings; and Crystal Griner and David Bailey, U.S. Capitol Police special agents, who were also wounded in the shootings. He also referred to Executive Order 13801.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126488", "text": "My fellow Americans, this week, our Nation was shocked and horrified when a gunman opened fire on a Member of Congress. Five people were wounded in the assault, including a member of House leadership: my good friend, Steve Scalise.\nSteve is beloved across Washington. He embodies everything public service is about; he's dedicated to his constituents, devoted to his values, and deeply committed to his country. I visited Steve, his wife, and his family in the hospital as he continues to fight for his recovery. Four hundred and thirty-five Members of Congress and 300 million Americans are pulling for him, praying for him, and pledging to him our full and total support. We continue to hold all of those wounded and fighting for recovery in our hearts and prayers, including Matt Mika, who was also badly wounded.\nIn that terrible crime, we also witnessed the incredible heroism of Capitol Police. Special Agent Crystal Griner—who I also had the honor of meeting during my visit to the Hospital—raced into gunfire, along with Special Agent David Bailey. They saved the lives of our Members of Congress and prevented that dark day from becoming a tragedy beyond imagination. They, like so many other courageous police officers, represent the very best of us. We salute them, and we also salute members of Alexandria Police, Fire, and Rescue.\nThough we have our differences, what unites us is so much stronger: our love of country, our devotion to its people. Now more than ever, these values must guide us and bring us closer together. Let us always remember that our job is to serve and represent the whole American people and that we are all children of the same God.\nThis week, my administration continues our focus on providing economic opportunity for all. On Thursday, I signed an Executive order to launch a groundbreaking new Apprenticeship Initiative that will help young Americans learn the skills they need to find a rewarding career, earn a great living, and support themselves and their families.\nWe are celebrating the dignity of work and the greatness of the American worker. American citizens have worked every job, every occupation, no matter what it might be, no matter how grueling, how challenging, or even how dangerous. They wash the windows on our tallest skyscrapers; they create works of art from burning fire and molten steel; they mine the earth and dive the ocean depths to bring energy into our cities and towns; they care for the sick, the elderly, and the wounded; and they lay the bricks, mortar, rebar, and concrete that give us places to live, to work, and to thrive.\nToday this is the message I want every young American to hear: There is dignity in every honest job, and there is nobility in every honest worker. Our Apprenticeship Initiative will make it dramatically easier for employers, industry groups, and unions to create exciting new apprenticeship programs that place students into high-paying careers. Instead of being wracked with crushing student debt, those who participate will earn while they learn. Think of that: earn while they learn.\nUnder our plan, young Americans will have a pathway to exciting and fulfilling careers. They will become brilliant technicians who revitalize American manufacturing. They will become welders who forge from fire amazing works of iron and steel and art. And they will become entrepreneurs who revolutionize entire industries. And these striving American citizens, including millions of talented young American women with tremendous potential, will become the programmers who change the world with the next great technological advance.\nEvery American deserves a path to a great job that they truly love. That begins with the right education, one that gives students the foundation for a lifetime of success. Every day, as your President, I will be committed to this goal.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2017-06-16", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Trump! Trump! Trump!\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. And thank you to my truly great friend, Vice President Mike Pence. He's terrific. And thank you to Miami. We love Miami.\nLet me start by saying that I'm glad Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and I, along with a very talented team, were able to get Otto Warmbier back with his parents. What's happened to him is a truly terrible thing, but at least the ones who love him so much can now take care of him and be with him.\nAlso, my dear friend, Steve Scalise, took a bullet for all of us. And because of him and the tremendous pain and suffering he's now enduring—and he's having a hard time, far worse than anybody thought—our country will perhaps become closer, more unified. So important.\nSo we all owe Steve a big, big thank you. And let's keep the Warmbier family and the Scalise family and all of the victims of the congressional shooting, in our hearts and prayers. And it was quite a day, and our police officers were incredible, weren't they? They did a great job. Great job.\nAnd let us all pray for a future of peace, unity, and safety for all of our people. [Applause] Thank you. And for Cuba.\nI am so thrilled to be back here with all of my friends in Little Havana. [Laughter] I love it. I love this city. And one other big——\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you.\nNow, this is an amazing community, the Cuban American community, so much love. I saw that immediately.\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. Thank you, darling. Oh, do I love you too. [Laughter]\nWhat you have built here—a vibrant culture, a thriving neighborhood, the spirit of adventure—is a testament to what a free Cuba could be. And with God's help, a free Cuba is what we will soon achieve.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nAudience member. Donald Trump! Donald Trump!\nThe President. And I don't even mind that it is 110 degrees up here. [Laughter] This room is packed. You know, it wasn't designed for this. I'd like to thank the fire department. [Laughter] We are delighted to be joined by so many friends and leaders of our great community. I want to express our deep gratitude to a man that's really become a friend of mine—and I want to tell you, he is one tough competitor—Senator Marco Rubio. Great guy. He is tough! Man! He is tough, and he's good, and he loves you. He loves you.\nAnd I listened to another friend of mine, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, and I'll tell you, I loved what he said, and I appreciate it. Mario, I appreciated what you said so much. In fact, I was looking for Mario. I wanted to find him; they said he was onstage. I almost dragged him off the stage to thank him, but now I'm thanking you anyway. Thank you, Mario. That was great. Really appreciate it.\nAnd I also want to thank my good friend and just a man who was of tremendous support in the State of Florida for being with us, Governor Rick Scott. Great job. He's doing a great job. Oh, I hope he runs for the Senate. I know I'm not supposed to say that. I hope he runs for the Senate. Rick, are you running? Huh? Huh? I don't know. Marco, let's go, come on. We've got to get him to—I hope he runs for the Senate.\nWe're deeply honored to be joined by amazing veterans of the Bay of Pigs. These are great people, amazing people. I have wonderful memories from our visit during the campaign. That was some visit. That was right before the election. I guess it worked, right? Boy, Florida, as a whole, and this community that supported us, like, by tremendous margins. And we appreciate it. But including one of the big honors, and that was the honor of getting the Bay of Pigs award just before the election, and it's great to be gathered in a place named for a true hero of the Cuban people. And you know what that means.\nI was also looking forward to welcoming today two people who are not present—José Daniel Ferrer and Berta Soler—[applause]—were both prevented from leaving Cuba for this event. So we acknowledge them. They're great friends, great help. And although they could not be with us, we are with them 100 percent. Okay? We are with them. Right?\nFinally, I want to recognize everyone in the audience who has their own painful but important story to tell about the true and brutal nature of the Castro regime. Brutal. We thank the dissidents, the exiles, and the children of Operation Peter Pan—you know what that means—and all who gather in the cafes, churches, and the streets in this incredible area and city to speak the truth and to stand for justice.\nAnd we want to thank you all for being a voice for the voiceless. There are people—it's voiceless—but you are making up the difference, and we all want to thank you. This group is amazing. Just an incredible—you are an incredible group of talented, passionate people. Thank you. Incredible group of people.\nMany of you witnessed terrible crimes committed in service of a depraved ideology. You saw the dreams of generations held by captive, and just, literally, you look at what happened and what communism has done. You knew faces that disappeared, innocents locked in prisons, and believers persecuted for preaching the word of God. You watched the Women in White bruised, bloodied, and captured on their way from Mass. You have heard the chilling cries of loved ones or the cracks of firing squads piercing through the ocean breeze, not a good sound.\nAmong the courageous Cuban dissidents with us onstage here today are Cary Roque, who was imprisoned by the Castro regime 15 years ago. She looks awfully good.\nJournalist Cary Roque. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Thank you, Marco Rubio, Mario Diaz-Balart. Thank you to all the mainland Cubans who fight no matter what the times can be for the Cuban liberty. On behalf—Mr. President, on behalf of the Cuban people, the people inside my eyes, my homeland, thank you. Thank you, and we appreciate your love.\nThe President. Thank you. Wow. That's pretty good. She didn't know she was going to do that either, I will tell you. Thank you very much.\nAntúnez, imprisoned for 17 years—where is he? I love that name. Antúnez—I love that name—[laughter]—and Ángel de Fana, imprisoned for over 20 years. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Very brave people.\nThe exiles and dissidents here today have witnessed communism destroy a nation, just as communism has destroyed every single nation where it has ever been tried. But we will not be silent in the face of communist oppression any longer. You have seen the truth, you have spoken the truth, and the truth has now called us—this group—called us to action. Thank you.\nLast year, I promised to be a voice against repression in our region—remember, tremendous repression—and a voice for the freedom of the Cuban people. You heard that pledge. You exercised the right you have to vote. You went out, and you voted. And here I am like I promised. Like I promised. I promise you, I keep my promises. Sometimes, in politics, they take a little bit longer, but we get there. We get there. Don't we get there? You better believe it, Mike. We get there.\nAudience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\nThe President. [Laughter] Thank you. Thank you. No, we keep our promise. And now that I am your President, America will expose the crimes of the Castro regime and stand with the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom. Because we know it is best for America to have freedom in our hemisphere, whether in Cuba or Venezuela, and to have a future where the people of each country can live out their own dreams.\nFor nearly six decades, the Cuban people have suffered under communist domination. To this day, Cuba is ruled by the same people who killed tens of thousands of their own citizens, who sought to spread their repressive and failed ideology throughout our hemisphere, and who once tried to host enemy nuclear weapons 90 miles from our shores.\nThe Castro regime has shipped arms to North Korea and fueled chaos in Venezuela. While imprisoning innocents, it has harbored cop killers, hijackers, and terrorists. It has supported human trafficking, forced labor, and exploitation all around the globe. This is the simple truth of the Castro regime. My administration will not hide from it, excuse it, or glamorize it. And we will never, ever be blind to it. We know what's going on, and we remember what happened.\nAudience members. Trump! Trump! Trump!\nThe President. On my recent trip overseas, I said the United States is adopting a principled realism, rooted in our values, shared interests, and common sense. I also said countries should take greater responsibility for creating stability in their own regions. It's hard to think of a policy that makes less sense than the prior administration's terrible and misguided deal with the Castro regime. Well, you have to say, the Iran deal was pretty bad also, in all fairness. Let's not forget that beauty.\nThey made a deal with a Government that spreads violence and instability in the region, and nothing they got—think of it, nothing they got—they fought for everything and we just didn't fight hard enough. But now those days are over. Now we hold the cards. We now hold the cards.\nThe previous administration's easing of restrictions on travel and trade does not help the Cuban people; they only enrich the Cuban regime. The profits from investment and tourism flow directly to the military. The regime takes the money and owns the industry. The outcome of last administration's executive action has been only more repression and a move to crush the peaceful, democratic movement. Therefore, effective immediately, I am canceling the last administration's completely one-sided deal with Cuba.\nAudience members. Trump! Trump! Trump!\nThe President. I am announcing today a new policy, just as I promised during the campaign, and I will be signing that contract right at that table in just a moment.\nOur policy will seek a much better deal for the Cuban people and for the United States of America. We do not want U.S. dollars to prop up a military monopoly that exploits and abuses the citizens of Cuba. Our new policy begins with strictly enforcing U.S. law. We will not lift sanctions on the Cuban regime until all political prisoners are freed, freedoms of assembly and expression are respected, all political parties are legalized, and free and internationally supervised elections are scheduled. Elections.\nWe will very strongly restrict American dollars flowing to the military, security, and intelligence services that are the core of the Castro regime. They will be restricted. We will enforce the ban on tourism. We will enforce the embargo. We will take concrete steps to ensure that investments flow directly to the people so they can open private businesses and begin to build their country's great, great future: a country of great potential.\nMy action today bypasses the military and the Government to help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives. We will keep in place the safeguards to prevent Cubans from risking their lives to unlawful travel to the United States. They are in such danger the way they have to come to this country, and we are going to be safeguarding those people. We have to. We have no choice. We have to.\nAnd we will work for the day when a new generation of leaders brings this long reign of suffering to an end. And I do believe that end is in the very near future. We challenge Cuba to come to the table with a new agreement that is in the best interests of both their people and our people and also of Cuban Americans.\nTo the Cuban Government, I say: Put an end to the abuse of dissidents; release the political prisoners; stop jailing innocent people; open yourselves to political and economic freedoms; return the fugitives from American justice, including the return of the cop-killer Joanne Chesimard; and finally, hand over the Cuban military criminals who shot down and killed four brave members of Brothers to the Rescue who were in unarmed, small, slow civilian planes.\nThose victims included Mario de la Peña, Jr., and Carlos Costa. We are honored to be joined today by Mario's parents Miriam and Mario and Carlos's sister Mirta. Where are you? Huh? Those are great, great parents who love their children so much. What they've done is just an incredible, incredible thing. What they represent—they did not die in vain—what they represent to everybody, and especially to the Cuban people. So your children did not die in vain, believe me. So to the Castro regime, I repeat: The harboring of criminals and fugitives will end. You have no choice. It will end.\nAny changes to the relationship between the United States and Cuba will depend on real progress toward these and the other goals, many of which I've described. When Cuba is ready to take concrete steps to these ends, we will be ready, willing, and able to come to the table to negotiate that much better deal for Cubans, for Americans. Much better deal and a deal that's fair. A deal that's fair and a deal that makes sense.\nOur Embassy remains open in the hope that our countries can forge a much stronger and better path. America believes that free, independent, and sovereign nations are the best vehicle for human happiness, for health, for education, for safety, for everything. We all accept that all nations have the right to chart their own paths—and I'm certainly a very big believer in that—so we will respect Cuban sovereignty. But we will never turn our backs on the Cuban people. That will not happen.\nOver the years, a special sympathy has grown between this land of the free and the beautiful people of that island, so close to our shores and so deeply woven into the history of our region. America has rejected the Cuban people's oppressors. They are rejected. Officially today, they are rejected. And to those people, America has become a source of strength, and our flag a symbol of hope.\nI know that is exactly what America is to you and what it represents to you. It represents the same to me. It represents the same to all of us. And that is what it was to a little boy, Luis Haza. You ever hear of Luis? He became very famous, great talent. Just 8 years old when Fidel Castro seized power. At the time, Luis's father was the police chief in Santiago de Cuba. You know Santiago? Yes? Oh, they know Santiago. Just days after Fidel took control, his father was one of 71 Cubans executed by firing squad near San Juan Hill at the hands of the Castro regime.\nLuis buried his grief in his great love of music. He began playing the violin so brilliantly and so beautifully. Soon the regime saw his incredible gift and wanted to use him for propaganda purposes. When he was 12, they organized a national television special and demanded he play a solo for Raúl Castro, who by the way is leaving now. I wonder why.\nThey sent an official to fetch Luis from his home. But Luis refused to go. And a few days later, Castro's soldiers barged into his orchestra practice area, guns blazing. They told him to play for them. Terrified, Luis began to play. And the entire room was stunned by what they heard. Ringing out from the trembling boy's violin was a tune they all recognized. This young Cuban boy was playing \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Luis played the American national anthem all the way through, and when he finished, the room was dead silent.\nWhen we say that America stands as a symbol to the world—a symbol of freedom and a symbol of hope—that is what Luis meant, and that is what Luis displayed that day. It was a big day. It was a great day. And that is what we will all remain. That was a very important moment, just like this is now for Cuba. A very important moment. America will always stand for liberty, and America will always pray and cheer for the freedom of the Cuban people.\nNow, that little boy, whose story I just told you, the one who played that violin so beautifully so many years ago, is here with us today in our very, very packed and extremely warm auditorium. [Laughter] Of course, he is no longer a little boy, but a world-renowned violinist and conductor. One of the greats. And today he will once again play his violin and fill the hearts of all who love and cherish Cuba, the United States, and freedom. I would like to now invite Luis to the stage. Luis.\n[At this point, Luis Haza played \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" on the violin.]\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. Thank you, Luis. I just said, so where were you more nervous? Today or then? He said, honestly, I think today. That's pretty—[laughter]. Thank you, Luis, that was beautiful.\nSo I want to thank Miami. I want to thank Little Havana. Havana, we love. Do we love it? Would you move anywhere else? You wouldn't move to Palm Beach, would you? No. No way. Little Havana.\nAnd I want to thank all of our great friends here today. You've been amazing, loyal, beautiful people. And——\nAudience member. Happy birthday!\nThe President. Thank you. Don't remind me. Actually, I was telling Mike, so it was 2 days on my birthday. Until a big day, which turned out to be tomorrow—the 16th. That was the day I came down with Melania on the escalator at Trump Tower. That's tomorrow. So it's exactly tomorrow, 2 years since we announced. And it worked out okay. Worked out okay. It's a great honor. Believe me, it's a great honor. Right?\n[Audience members sang \"Happy Birthday.\"]\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nI just want to end by saying may God bless everyone searching for freedom. May God bless Cuba. May God bless the United States of America. And God bless you all. Thank you. Now I'm going to sign. Thank you.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\n[The President signed the memorandum.]\nSo this says, \"Strengthening the Policy of the United States Toward Cuba.\" And I can add, \"strengthening a lot.\" [Laughter] So this is very important, and you watch what's going to happen. Going to be a great day for Cuba.\nThank you. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-06-16", "title": "Remarks on Signing a Memorandum on Strengthening the Policy of the United States Toward Cuba in Miami, Florida"}

Purpose.\nThe United States recognizes the need for more freedom and democracy, improved respect for human rights, and increased free enterprise in Cuba. The Cuban people have long suffered under a Communist regime that suppresses their legitimate aspirations for freedom and prosperity and fails to respect their essential human dignity.\nMy Administration's policy will be guided by the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States, as well as solidarity with the Cuban people. I will seek to promote a stable, prosperous, and free country for the Cuban people. To that end, we must channel funds toward the Cuban people and away from a regime that has failed to meet the most basic requirements of a free and just society.\nIn Cuba, dissidents and peaceful protesters are arbitrarily detained and held in terrible prison conditions. Violence and intimidation against dissidents occurs with impunity. Families of political prisoners are not allowed to assemble or peacefully protest the improper confinement of their loved ones. Worshippers are harassed, and free association by civil society organizations is blocked. The right to speak freely, including through access to the internet, is denied, and there is no free press. The United States condemns these abuses.\nThe initial actions set forth in this memorandum, including restricting certain financial transactions and travel, encourage the Cuban government to address these abuses. My Administration will continue to evaluate its policies so as to improve human rights, encourage the rule of law, foster free markets and free enterprise, and promote democracy in Cuba.\nSec. 2. Policy.\nIt shall be the policy of the executive branch to:\n(a) End economic practices that disproportionately benefit the Cuban government or its military, intelligence, or security agencies or personnel at the expense of the Cuban people.\n(b) Ensure adherence to the statutory ban on tourism to Cuba. (c) Support the economic embargo of Cuba described in section 4(7) of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 (the embargo), including by opposing measures that call for an end to the embargo at the United Nations and other international forums and through regular reporting on whether the conditions of a transition government exist in Cuba.\n(d) Amplify efforts to support the Cuban people through the expansion of internet services, free press, free enterprise, free association, and lawful travel.\n(e) Not reinstate the \"Wet Foot, Dry Foot\" policy, which encouraged untold thousands of Cuban nationals to risk their lives to travel unlawfully to the United States.\n(f) Ensure that engagement between the United States and Cuba advances the interests of the United States and the Cuban people. These interests include: advancing Cuban human rights; encouraging the growth of a Cuban private sector independent of government control; enforcing final orders of removal against Cuban nationals in the United States; protecting the national security and public health and safety of the United States, including through proper engagement on criminal cases and working to ensure the return of fugitives from American justice living in Cuba or being harbored by the Cuban government; supporting United States agriculture and protecting plant and animal health; advancing the understanding of the United States regarding scientific and environmental challenges; and facilitating safe civil aviation.\nSec. 3. Implementation.\nThe heads of departments and agencies shall begin to implement the policy set forth in section 2 of this memorandum as follows:\n(a) Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce, as appropriate and in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Transportation, shall initiate a process to adjust current regulations regarding transactions with Cuba.\n(i) As part of the regulatory changes described in this subsection, the Secretary of State shall identify the entities or subentities, as appropriate, that are under the control of, or act for or on behalf of, the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services or personnel (such as Grupo de Administracion Empresarial S.A. (GAESA), its affiliates, subsidiaries, and successors), and publish a list of those identified entities and subentities with which direct financial transactions would disproportionately benefit such services or personnel at the expense of the Cuban people or private enterprise in Cuba.\n(ii) Except as provided in subsection (a)(iii) of this section, the regulatory changes described in this subsection shall prohibit direct financial transactions with those entities or subentities on the list published pursuant to subsection (a)(i) of this section.\n(iii) The regulatory changes shall not prohibit transactions that the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Secretary of State, determines are consistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this memorandum and:\n(A) concern Federal Government operations, including Naval Station Guantanamo Bay and the United States mission in Havana; (B) support programs to build democracy in Cuba;\n(C) concern air and sea operations that support permissible travel, cargo, or trade;\n(D) support the acquisition of visas for permissible travel;\n(E) support the expansion of direct telecommunications and internet access for the Cuban people;\n(F) support the sale of agricultural commodities, medicines, and medical devices sold to Cuba consistent with the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.) and the Cuban Democracy Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 6001 et seq.);\n(G) relate to sending, processing, or receiving authorized remittances;\n(H) otherwise further the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States; or\n(I) are required by law.\n(b) Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Secretary of State, shall initiate a process to adjust current regulations to ensure adherence to the statutory ban on tourism to Cuba.\n(i) The amended regulations shall require that educational travel be for legitimate educational purposes.

The Secretary of Defense shall continue to provide support, as necessary, to the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security in carrying out the duties regarding interdiction of migrants.

The examples they set and the lessons they impart about hard work, dedication to family, faith in God, and believing in ourselves establish the moral foundation for success that allows us to live up to our full potential.

Whether by birth, adoption, or foster care, today we honor the incredible fathers in our lives for all they have done and continue to do for us.

A belated Father's Day to all the dads out there. Hope you enjoyed your day. I also want to extend a very happy birthday in absentia to Jeff Mason. Sorry he can't be here, but I'm sure he's enjoying his birthday a little bit more.\nQ: Slacker is what he said. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: I do want to start by saying that the President and the entire administration extends our thoughts and prayers to the sailors -- the seven Navy sailors who lost their lives this past weekend. Their deaths while on patrol in the Western Pacific are a sobering reminder of the dangers that the men and women of our military face every day.\nThe President has been made aware of the attack in London and is receiving consistent updates from the staff. His counterterrorism advisor and other senior White House staff continue to track the situation and have been in frequent contact with their British counterparts since it occurred. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families, and we've made it very clear to our British allies that we stand ready to provide any support or assistance that they may need.\nToday, as you may have seen, is the beginning of Tech Week here at the White House, in which we'll see the President and his Cabinet and staff traveling both inside and outside the Beltway to highlight how government can take advantage of new technologies and ways of thinking to provide better services to all Americans, and at the same time encourage our economy to grow quickly and efficiently. The incredible ingenuity of American innovation and technology has provided us with more efficient solutions to problems large and small -- from making it easier to get a ride across town, to safely shifting lifesaving medications around the world.\nBut the federal government has been able to take advantage of these advances, leaving citizens stuck with an outdated and ineffective system that makes it more difficult to access critical services. Just a few examples that have been highlighted by others: Americans spend about 35 hours a year filling out government forms. The veterans who appeal a disability claim wait an average of five years for a decision. And the VA has over 1,000 different support phone numbers.\nLast week, the Office of Management and Budget decided to pull 59 of its 253 guidance and policy documents, which included an ongoing report requirement for Y2K. And I know some of you may be too young to remember, but Y2K occurred 17 years ago, which completed -- that completed the first phase of OMB's war on waste.\nSo, this week, we're particularly emphasizing how we can use technology to improve government services. It's part of the administration's wider goal to modernize and streamline our federal government to make it more respectful of taxpayers. Suffice it to say, there's a lot of room for optimization in the federal government.\nToday, the President will hear from leaders in the private sector about what they've done in their businesses and organizations to adapt their services and practices for the constantly changing landscape of the American economy. And throughout the week, the administration will be discussing how to become more adaptable to new technologies that can help our government work better for our people, with state and local officials, job creators, and educators throughout the country.\nOutside the Beltway, while in Arkansas to visit the Fayetteville Medical Center, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Shulkin will also visit Walmart headquarters to learn about their logistical supply chain program and how its best practices can be adapted to help the VA deliver better practices and care to our nation's veterans. We're also looking at ways that the federal government can act as a partner for the private sector to encourage future innovation.\nHere in Washington, Secretary Ross of Commerce is at the SelectUSA investment summit where over 1,200 international firms, attendees from 64 markets, are gathering to promote and facilitate high-impact business investment from the United States -- in the United States from foreign investors. SelectUSA is the only national-level foreign direct investment promotion program in the United States, and by leveraging the influence of the United States government on the world stage, it has created a powerful catalyst for state, regional, and local economic development.\nThroughout this week, we'll be highlighting the opportunities for government to combine its potential for large-scale change with technological advancement, such as the ones produced by the private sector to move our economy forward and make our government work better for every American.\nAnd the American people can see that the President is making the right moves to get the economy going again. Just this morning, CNBC's All-America Economic Survey showed that economic optimism has reached historic levels. It's clear that the President's pro-growth economic message is resonating with the American people, and he will continue to unleash the private sector, level the playing field for American businesses abroad, and invest in the technology of the future.\nAnd before I wrap up, I just want to mention that, earlier today, the President and the First Lady released a statement commemorating Juneteenth, a historic day recognizing the end of slavery. They share their warmest greetings with all those separating -- celebrating this historic moment. On June 19th, 1865, that the residents of Galveston, Texas first heard the words the Emancipation Proclamation, as President Lincoln's message finally reached the southern states.\nAnd with that, I'll take some questions. In honor of Jeff, I will call on his colleague, Steve Holland.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. How are you responding to this Russian threat to shoot down American planes over Syria?\nMR. SPICER: Well, obviously, we're going to do what we can to protect our interests. And this is something that we're going to continue to work with -- keep the lines of communication open.\nAnd ISIS represents a threat to all nations, and so we've got to do what we can to work with partners. And we're going to continue to keep an open mind of communication with the Russians.\nQ: So will the U.S. change its flight patterns or behavior in Syria?\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to refer -- I mean, I think this is a question more for DOD to answer. But I think, obviously, it's important and crucial that we keep lines of communication open to de-conflict potential issues.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Following up on that -- and a second one for you, as well -- what would the U.S. government's response be? Is the White House going to issue a warning to the Russian government if they were to follow through on this threat? It seems that your statement -- would that be a provocation or something worse, potentially?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, I think that the escalation of hostilities among the many factions that are operating in this region doesn't help anybody. And the Syrian regime and others in the regime need to understand that we will retain the right of self-defense, of coalition forces aligned against ISIS.\nQ: And just a separate question, given that we're off-camera and off-audio today, the President isn't speaking in a formal setting later. So can you explain why our friends in television and radio can't use this live?\nMR. SPICER: I've said it since the beginning -- the President spoke today, he was on camera. He'll make another comment today at the technology summit. And there are days that I'll decide that the President's voice should be the one that speaks, and iterate his priorities.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. You got some of the most high-profile CEOs on the planet here today. They're from the tech industry, though, and there's been a lot written about the fact that the tech industry has been doing a lot to eliminate jobs in terms of automation and self-driving cars, eliminating staff at retail outlets -- that sort of thing. This administration is all about creating jobs. Can you tell me what the President's message is to the tech industry, broadly, in terms of the need to create jobs in the United States?\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, I mean, if you look at the collection of individuals that's here that you mention, you've got 18 CEOs that represent over $3.5 trillion of market value. I mentioned just a minute ago, you have an OMB report that we're talking Y2K. I can't speak certainly, but I would imagine that much of that market value in those companies has come post-Y2K. So we have an ever-changing economy.\nThere are things that -- if you think about all of those things that they're creating, some of the companies were in their infancy back 17 years ago. But they are creating new opportunities for Americans, as I just mentioned. And I think that they have allowed us to live better lives, in many ways; allowed us to be more efficient, and provided services.\nSo there are certain things that we're not going to do anymore. The market for typewriters has probably gone down. But we have added a whole new technological sector. Several of the companies that are represented there not just have services, but products that have come to light in the last decade or so.\nSo I think that's part of the reason the President wants to bring them here is to talk about how they can utilize those levels of innovation and entrepreneurship to help our country grow.\nQ: Is there any concern that they're not doing enough to create jobs?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think the idea is to make sure that we have an economy and a government that is giving them the most opportunity to create jobs, whether it's the regulatory system or a tax reform system. We need to be having that conversation with this sector, the technology sector, the manufacturing sector, the mining sector.\nI mean, I think American industry and companies from coast to coast want to be hiring more, want to be growing, want to be expanding here in this country. And I think the message that the President has heard over and over again has been give us a lower regulatory burden, take the shackles off of us, and we want to grow and create, pay higher wages, expand in this country. So that's part of it.\nBut obviously the big goal out of today is to figure out how we can use some of that innovation to make our government more effective and efficient for our citizens.\nQ: Eric Schmidt obviously campaigning pretty aggressively for the President's opponent in the last campaign. Any particular message from the President to Eric Schmidt today?\nMR. SPICER: Help us make a more efficient and effective government. I think it's pretty telling that the President brings these kind of people together. We will work with individuals, regardless of what their past political beliefs are, to further the President's agenda and to bring ideas to the table. And that's what, I think, a lot of these folks are coming to do.\nAnd there's a few things -- I don't want to get ahead of the comments -- but when you look at a lot of the services -- and one that didn't come out of this but it's a perfect example; I highlighted it last week -- you have veterans' medical records, something that has been talked about for literally decades, and this administration getting it done. And Dr. Shulkin, working with some of the folks here, taking the President's charge, figuring out how to make it happen.\nBut that is such a -- something that has been a huge obstacle for the military and veteran community for a long time. And to have that kind of innovation come forward will improve the lives and safety of so many of our veterans and the impact it has. That kind of thinking -- how do we take a process, an interaction with the government that is unwieldy right now, and figure out a way to make it easier for someone to schedule an appointment to get to the VA, or get a mortgage or a student loan. There are so many issues.\nAnd when you hear a lot of the ideas that are being talked about today, it's pretty fascinating to think if we can solve just a fraction of them, what a better government we will have for our people.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. We got a reaction today from Cuba's foreign minister as it relates to U.S.-Cuba policy, which was announced by the President last week. And one of the things he said is, under no circumstances will Cuba release any of those fugitives that President Trump asked Cuba to release. What kind of pressure can be brought to bear on the Cuban government to get that particular element of what the President wanted actually taking place?\nMR. SPICER: The number-one piece of what the President did was to lay the groundwork for empowering the Cuban people to develop greater economic and political liberty. That was at the heart of what this did. It was a promise that he made during the campaign trail. And I think instead of empowering the Cuban military and its ability to control the money that goes through, which was not getting to the people, the President's actions that he took on Friday are going to help empower the people and make sure that not only does he maintain a promise that the American people follow the law, but the bigger result is that we empower the Cuban people. And I think that's the real big takeaway that I have.\nQ: Do you anticipate the President announcing any further sanctions on the Cuban government to get various things related to Cuban rights solved or these fugitives brought back to America?\nMR. SPICER: I think -- let's let the first -- we're one business day into these actions that the President took. I think they're being widely hailed as a step in the right direction to accomplishing -- empowering the Cuban people. Let's give it a little time. But as the President says on a variety of subjects, let's not project what we're going to do and make sure that we see how things -- and reserve the right to go forward.\nTrey.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Obviously, a major escalation over the weekend in Syria. What message does President Trump have for the government of Russia as these tensions continue in the region?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think I mentioned it -- I think it was to Zeke earlier -- but, I mean, the escalation of hostilities among all of the factions that are operating there doesn't help anybody. And so making sure that people understand that, while we want to deescalate the situation there, that we have to understand that we will always preserve the right of self-defense.\nQ: And just a quick follow-up on the Middle East. Can you talk about how the President was involved in the decision to send Jared Kushner to Israel and Palestine later this week?\nMR. SPICER: So both Jared and Jason Greenblatt -- Jason is already -- I think he should have landed. I'm trying to remember the time change in my head. But Jason is headed over there; Jared will join him later this week. This is a continuation of the President's trip and conversations that he began in Israel to further Middle East peace and make incremental changes in the right direction.\nCharlie.\nQ: I wondered if the -- the President called the H1-B visa \"very, very bad\" for workers during the campaign, and I noticed that it's part of the agenda today. Is the President going into this meeting today open to the idea of expanding H1-B visas?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President is going into this meeting to listen, primarily as -- again, remember the focus is really going to be on making sure that -- how can we harness some of the technological innovation and entrepreneurship of these successful companies to help our government. That's pretty much the focus.\nBut I think there's also a worker component to this. We've talked a lot about visa reform in the past, and I think the President wants to make sure that he listens to the various people who have interest in this subject.\nQ: Does the President have a position on EB-5 visas?\nMR. SPICER: The President is -- I think -- I'll leave it at this: The President believes that we have to do a lot to overhaul our entire visa process, whether it's -- well, I'm not going to get into the --\nQ: So a visa overhaul will be included in this?\nMR. SPICER: No, no. I'm sorry. I think the question you were asking wasn't specific to the summit. So I just want to be clear. But I think he has made it clear in the past that, looking at all the visa programs and how we apply them and who gets them, and whether or not we're doing it in the smartest way, is something he addressed in the Joint -- if you remember, that he talked about it a little in the Joint Address as well. And so we'll continue to have that conversation.\nJill.\nQ: Just to follow up, firstly, on Jared's trip. Can you talk just a little bit more about what the specific goal is here? I mean, is this the first step to potentially setting up some kind of meeting here, to bringing the leaders back to the U.S.? What specifically are his aims?\nMR. SPICER: Well, look, as I just mentioned, I mean, I'm not going to get -- let's let them get over there and have these conversations. They're going to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu and senior officials on his team. They're going to meet with President Abbas and officials on his team later in the week. And I think part of it is to figure out how to make incremental change that results in a lasting peace.\nAnd that's -- but I don't want to get ahead of this. Part of this is really to utilize the trust that has been built up, and not have these negotiations out in public. But I think that they had a very successful visit when the President was over there and they're going to continue to build on that.\nQ: Okay. And then secondly, we heard from one of the Sunday shows, a member of the President's legal team mentioned something about us potentially seeing some answer on this question of recordings of conversations between the President and Comey. Can you explain to us what he meant when he said that we might get an answer in the week ahead? Are you planning to do some kind of release, some kind of announcement?\nMR. SPICER: I do not have a specific answer to that, but I will tell you I believe the President will comment in the next couple of weeks. So it's possible that we have an answer to that by the end of this week.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Tomorrow is zero-hour in Georgia's sixth district. And earlier this morning, the President tweeted out a very robust endorsement of Republican Karen Handel. The Democratic nominee, right up to the end, has called this a way of sending a message to the President. Does the President view this as a referendum on his administration? And will he have a response tomorrow to any outcome in Georgia?\nMR. SPICER: Well, look -- as you know, in the past, I've made it clear it would be inappropriate for me to comment on specific political races from this podium while they're ongoing. So that being said, I will just say, obviously the President is going to do whatever he has to to help support growing his majorities in both Houses. But let's wait and see how that turns out. And I'm sure we'll have some kind of readout. We'll be able to provide that.\nQ: Do you feel good about it?\nMR. SPICER: I haven't spent a ton of time thinking about it. I know it's obviously garnered a lot of attention. We feel very good. The President has been very helpful down there. But I'm not going to go any further from this podium.\nAnita.\nQ: Two issues. One, can you clarify, last week DHS put out the memo regarding DAPA, and said that DACA DREAMers were status quo. What is the status of that? Is there a certain amount of time that the administration is going to study that and decide what to do with that?\nMR. SPICER: As I recall, the DAPA issue was in reference to a pending court case. So it just was that the DAPA announcement and action was due to a pending case. The DACA thing is still something that is ongoing.\nQ: Yeah. And how long -- I mean, is there a timetable on that study?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's -- as I mentioned, I mean, there is an entirety of immigration that deals with visa reform and other aspects, including that, that the President continues to review. Members of the team are working on. I don't have anything for you at this time.\nQ: And then the second question -- this was actually from last week but I don't think I had an opportunity to ask you. The President was quoted as saying that the House healthcare bill was \"mean.\" I'm just wondering, forward-looking here, does that hurt the prospect of getting something through the Senate? If you could just comment on that. How does that help or hurt?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think this is something that Senate Majority Leader McConnell is working very closely with the administration on. He's mentioned scheduling a vote. He's working with his Senate colleagues. And we've had some senators over here to discuss it. We feel very good about the progress that's happening and a lot of the meetings that are happening behind the scenes to further that. And I think the House looks forward to taking up the next piece of this when it comes out of the Senate.\nQ: What about the President's comment?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to comment on rumors that came out of a private meeting.\nQ: Are you saying it's not true?\nMR. SPICER: No, I'm just saying I'm not going to comment on rumors of alleged comments that were from a private meeting with the President.\nQ: Sean, does the President have full confidence in his Deputy Attorney General?\nMR. SPICER: The President has confidence in everyone who serves him in this administration.\nQ: Including Rod Rosenstein?\nMR. SPICER: He serves in this administration.\nQ: Following on that, last week Sarah told us that the President has no intention of firing Rosenstein as the Deputy Attorney General, but he has the right to do so. Rosenstein testified that only -- I'm sorry, right to fire Rob Mueller, the special counsel. Rosenstein testified that the regulations give him that power. So how is the White House concluding that the President has the right to fire the special counsel?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, I think the broader point here is that everyone who serves the President serves at the pleasure of the President. It may take -- I get there may be a technicality as to whom reports to whom. But the bottom line is, is that everybody who is in a status of that serves at the pleasure of the President of the United States.\nQ: Even though the regulation says that --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I understand your question that, on an org chart, the FBI goes to the Deputy Attorney General. But at the end of the day, that person then reports to the President. So, ultimately, everybody who is a political appointee of some sort reports to the President, right?\nQ: Sure. I'm just wondering if you think that the regulation enjoins the President --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I'm not here to argue the HR component of this. I do know that, again, if you look at the org chart, the Deputy Attorney General, who is appointed by the President, the FBI director reports to him.\nQ: The special counsel.\nMR. SPICER: The special counsel -- I apologize. So yeah -- so, I mean, that's how --\nDeborah.\nQ: As you know, in 2016, when the President visited Las Vegas, he didn't have a position on Yucca Mountain, this nuclear waste facility. He said he'd articulate something, but he didn't then. He still hasn't quite said anything, but we have had money in the \"skinny budget,\" things seem to be moving forward. And I just want to know, what informed the President's thinking on Yucca Mountain? Does he want it to be a nuclear waste facility? And if so, what kind of checking did he do to get there?\nMR. SPICER: That's a great question. I probably need to do some following up on that. I don't have an answer right now for you on that. I can try to get you --\nQ: Do you know when you'll have an answer?\nMR. SPICER: As soon as I -- I will follow up with our team to find out on the policy side where we are on that and what conversations we're going to have.\nQ: I have a question for you, following up on healthcare, and then another one. A lot of criticism this is happening behind closed doors. This is something that Republicans criticized Democrats about a few years ago when Obamacare was being worked out. The Senate is working, obviously, some say in secret on this. Is the President comfortable with that?\nMR. SPICER: I can't say I've actually asked him. I mean, this is more of a Senate process question. I will say -- and I don't have the quote in front of me -- but I believe that at the beginning, Senator Schumer made it very clear that something along the lines of \"I don't intend to work with anyone who seeks to repeal and replace Obamacare.\" So it's not that they were shocked that after he let it be known that they didn't want to work with people, it's a little odd that now they're saying, you're not working with us.\nQ: But the President is comfortable leaving this --\nMR. SPICER: I don't think the President gets involved in deciding how the Senate does its business --\nQ: Okay. The second question for you: Does the President think it's appropriate for his campaign, just this month, to cite to an organization, Infowars, that called Sandy Hook a hoax and says 9/11 was not --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not familiar with that. Obviously, it would be better to contact the campaign on something like that.\nYes.\nQ: Does the President have plans to meet the Ukrainian President, Poroshenko?\nMR. SPICER: I believe that the Vice President -- he will be meeting with the Vice President. We'll have a readout after that. And then if we have any updates on the President's schedule, I'll let you know later today as far as what his schedule looks like for tomorrow.\nQ: A couple of weeks ago, we asked you if the President believes in climate change, and I don't think we got an answer on that. And what's going on with the tapes?\nMR. SPICER: I answered the --\nQ: Sorry, I missed it.\nMR. SPICER: Oh, I just said, the President, I believe it was in the two-and-two, said that he would have an answer shortly. That would probably mean by the end of this week. And so --\nQ: And the climate change question?\nMR. SPICER: I have not -- I mean, it really has not been a focus of --\nQ: So is he meeting with the Vice President today?\nMR. SPICER: No, that's tomorrow.\nQ: Tomorrow.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah.\nBrian.\nQ: Real quick follow-up. With Russia -- I'll ask all three of them. On Russia, are we saying we're on the brink of war with Russia? Are you saying that that's a possibility?\nMR. SPICER: No, I didn't say that.\nQ: Okay. And number two, as far as what we're talking about with what Jim asked -- or I guess the question there is, is he reserving the right to fire everyone down the line until it gets to the special prosecutor? Or is he saying he's going to leave him alone to do his job?\nAnd three, on days that you come out here and there's not a camera and there's not a microphone, and the President speaks, could you ask him if he'd be ever so kind as to step up here and answer some questions from us on that day?\nMR. SPICER: I'll let him know you're -- I'll be sure to share your sentiments with him.\nQ: But can you answer the other one about --\nMR. SPICER: Well, what Steve said was -- he asked about -- I'm sorry, you were --\nQ: On Rosenstein, you're saying that --\nMR. SPICER: No, I was explaining to him how it works.\nQ: So everyone is ultimately responsible to the President. He reserves the right to fire everybody on down the line until he gets to the person he wants. Is that what you're --\nMR. SPICER: No, what I'm saying is that the way it works is if you're appointed -- if you serve at the pleasure of the President, you serve at the pleasure of the President. That's a fact.\nQ: So I get that. But would he work his way down the line if he was --\nMR. SPICER: That's a hypothetical question. I mean, the bottom line is, I answered a question as to how the system is set up. That's it.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Last week, the United States took action to begin extradition of the former Panamanian President Martinelli, who's been living in Florida and faces corruption charges back home in Panama. Was the White House aware of that in advance of this meeting? And was that sort of a condition for this meeting?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- obviously, the White House was aware of it. I'm not going to comment any further on it, though.\nApril.\nQ: Sean, when it comes to London, what is the intelligence community doing in helping with trying to solve some of the terrorist acts there? And have we been getting any information, like in past administrations, on the chatter -- hearing things prior to it? What can you tell us from an intelligence standpoint?\nMR. SPICER: Well, respectfully, I'm not going to get into anything --\nQ: I mean, just on the basics, that you can give.\nMR. SPICER: Obviously, there's a lot of cooperation that continues to happen. One of the reasons that the President was so pleased to see the terror finance center set up in Saudi Arabia was looking at techniques. There is so much recruiting that goes on online and communication. The center that got stood up is a real positive step forward of being able to utilize tools and experiments to figure out if we can reverse engineer that same propaganda and figure out if there's a way to help deter people from doing that or detect it.\nBut there's a lot of things that are happening in the intelligence community where they're monitoring things at all times and trying to get ahead of the situation.\nQ: And a follow-up on this. Since 9/11, we've heard it's not a matter of \"if\" but \"when\" it would happen here in the States. Is this still a thought in this community, in the intelligence community and here at the White House, with the ramp-up of terror acts overseas -- is there a concern here that -- are you still using that philosophy \"it's not a matter of 'if' but 'when'\"?\nMR. SPICER: I know that both the President and Secretary Kelly in particular, as well as the NSC team, this is what they -- is what is their top priority. I mean, if you talk to Secretary Kelly -- and the reason that the President has taken the actions that he has, including the travel ban and including -- is to make sure that we're looking at both enhancing and reading the intelligence piece, but taking steps to secure this country, to make sure that the people who are coming here are doing so with the intention of coming here peacefully.\nSo I think the bigger question is -- or the bigger answer is that everything that we do and the President does and Secretary Kelly does -- obviously, Secretary Mattis, General McMaster, the entire team -- is to protect the people and to make sure that there is not an attack here, and that not only do we prevent anything from happening on our homeland, but eradicate it where we can in places throughout the world.\nQ: Can you be successful in protecting the people with that equation off the table at this moment?\nMR. SPICER: What equation?\nQ: The travel ban.\nMR. SPICER: Well, yeah -- I mean, we're going to do -- I mean, that's why the President is going to continue to fight for it. He's going to use every tool possible to make sure that we vet people, that we have the proper studies, that we use the proper tools and techniques. But, yeah, we're going to do everything we possibly can.\nQ: Sean, six individuals resigned over the weekend from the President's advisory council on HIV/AIDS, saying the President doesn't care about the disease. What's your reaction to that?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, respectfully, the President cares tremendously about that and the impact it has. Obviously, the individuals that he's appointed here in the White House have been in communication with various stakeholders in that community to help develop policies and formulas going forward, but we're going to continue to do what we can from a government standpoint.\nQ: What is the President's strategy to combat HIV/AIDS?\nMR. SPICER: As you recall, I think it was HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell came in and fired all of the Bush appointees. So this is -- if you look at how that happened, it probably wasn't the best sign, either.\nQ: What is the President's strategy to combat HIV/AIDS?\nMR. SPICER: Again, I know that they are working from the White House standpoint, from a policy standpoint, hand in glove with the commission and other members throughout the government to continue to develop a strategy and provide -- I think it's a holistic approach, both in this country and helping people abroad where that's a big issue.\nQ: And one more question. Will the President replace those six members who resigned from that council?\nMR. SPICER: I really don't have a personnel update. I'll try to get you something on that.\nQ: There's been a lot of talk since last week's shooting about whether the divisive political climate contributed to it. What does the President think about that?\nMR. SPICER: I don't believe that we have the intelligence at this time to make it formal. I think there's obviously an investigation that's ongoing and it would be highly inappropriate to stand up here and determine the exact nature of the cause while that investigation is happening.\nQ: What does he think about the shooter's reported support for Bernie Sanders and being a --\nMR. SPICER: Again, I think that it would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing investigation in terms of the motives until investigators have an opportunity to do their job.\nQ: At last word, the FBI and the CIA were still not handing over to the House Intelligence Committee the information they had requested on unmaskings and leakings. Does the administration believe that there should be a special counsel appointed to look into those issues separately, or do they have faith that Mueller will look at those --\nMR. SPICER: That's a question that is best directed towards the special counsel that exists right now. I don't know if that's the case. I'm not -- I don't have an update on that, so I don't have --\nQ: The President has tweeted his desire to look into --\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. I know what the President's goal is. I don't know the status between the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and what information they do or do not have with respect to those agencies.\nQ: They seem to feel they've been stonewalled.\nMR. SPICER: Again, I just don't have an update as far as what information they do or don't have. A lot of that is classified, so I wouldn't be able to share it if I could. But that's obviously something that's ongoing.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Has the President or members of his legislative team seen the text of the healthcare bill?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know. I've not asked that question. That's a good question. I just have not talked to the legislative affairs guys, so I know they are in constant communication. So whether they've seen the final draft, I know that is something that we've been working very closely with the Senate on. So I know that there's been a level of involvement.\nQ: So what informs the view of the White House that you feel very good about a vote being held by recess? And do you believe that not only a vote will be held, but that it will secure 50 votes?\nMR. SPICER: I think Senator McConnell -- no one probably knows the Senate better than Senator McConnell when it comes to getting things done. He knows his members, he knows the Senate, he knows the issue, and he is completely committed to the goal of repealing and replacing Obamacare with a patient-centric bill that will bring down costs and increase access. So we have every confidence in Senator McConnell's ability to get this done.\nThank you guys very much.\nEND 2:12 P.M.

It's great to have you at the White House. And I just wanted to pass on word: Otto Warmbier has just passed away. He spent a year and a half in North Korea. A lot of bad things happened. But at least we got him home to be with his parents, where they were so happy to see him, even though he was in very tough condition. But he just passed away a little while ago. It's a brutal regime, and we'll be able to handle it.\nBut I want to thank you all for being here, special people. I'm thrilled—really thrilled—to welcome many of you for the first time and certainly the first time meeting as the American Technology Council. We're joined by an incredible group of leaders on the absolute cutting edge of innovation, including many CEOs from the world's most successful businesses.\nWe have approximately $3.5 trillion of market value in this room, but that's almost the exact number that we've created since my election. [Laughter] In fact, I think we have you beat by a little bit, and—which is a pretty good number. But I congratulate you all. You've done an amazing job. Thank you for lending your time and your talent to the American people. A lot of ideas have come out of the room today, and a lot of ideas will over the next short period of time.\nI also want to welcome Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Kelly, Administrator Verma, and my Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney. Thank you all. Done a great job. I want to thank Jared and Chris—Chris Liddell—for assembling such a spectacular group of people. They're working very, very hard. I want to thank Ivanka for working so hard on it; it's a real passion.\nOur goal is to lead a sweeping transformation of the Federal Government's technology that will deliver dramatically better services for citizens, stronger protection from cyberattacks, which we were just discussing in the Oval Office with a little bit smaller group. And it's a big—that's a big problem, there's no question about it. We're going to be working on it, and we're going to solve the problem—and up to a trillion dollars in savings for taxpayers over the next 10 years. Over a trillion.\nWe're embracing big change, bold thinking, and outsider perspectives to transform Government and make it the way it should be and at far less cost. My administration has already taken very historic steps to modernize critical IT systems and make Government more transparent. As an example, you're seeing what we're doing with the airports, with all of the billions and billions of dollars that has—have been spent on planes flying all in the wrong directions, we're getting it changed. They've spent many billions of dollars, and we are getting that whole system fixed. Money wasted over the last 6 or 7 years, billions.\nVA Secretary Shulkin recently announced that we're upgrading technology to allow the seamless transfer of veterans' medical records from the Defense Department, which has been a huge problem for decades and decades for our great veterans. We'll have it fixed very soon, but it's been a problem for many, many decades. Across Government, we're fixing problems in months that others have not fixed in many, many years. And we're just getting started. Fifty years ago, our Government drove the innovation that inspired the world and put Americans on the Moon. Today, many of our agencies rely on painfully outdated technology, and yet we have the greatest people in technology that the world has ever seen right here with us in this room. And most of them are just nodding as I say that. [Laughter] They're actually agreeing with me, which—[laughter]—that's interesting, Eric, right?\nGovernment needs to catch up with the technology revolution. We're going to change that with the help of great American businesses like the people assembled. The businesses represented here today employ hundreds of thousands of American workers. Your innovation has shaped the modern world and created millions of jobs. America should be the global leader in government technology just as we are in every other aspect, and we are going to start our big edge again in technology, such an important industry. I view it from the standpoint of jobs and other things; you view it somewhat differently. But we're all in the same ballpark. It's so important. So important.\nMy administration is embracing a new spirit of innovation that will make life better for all Americans. And when it comes to what we're here for today, American technology, we're working very diligently with everybody, including Congress, on immigration so that you can get the people you want in your companies. And it's been a tremendous problem that you've had over the past long period of time. So we're working very hard on that, and we'll be able to solve that problem.\nI want to thank everyone in the room for lending your time again.\n[At this point, the President invited participants to introduce themselves and the meeting continued, but no transcript was provided.]", "timestamp": "2017-06-19", "title": "Remarks During a Roundtable Discussion With the American Technology Council"}

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126522", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you, Jay, for that kind introduction. Thank you for mentioning our new dog. I asked my wife for a motorcycle and I got a puppy -- (laughter) -- so I named it Harley.\nIt is wonderful to be with your today and great to be at the 2017 Summit for the most powerful voice for businesses that make things in America -- an organization leading innovation, creating opportunity, and pursuing progress every single day -- the National Association of Manufacturers. Welcome back to Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\nIt is an honor to have the opportunity to address you today. And I bring greetings from my friend -- and the best friend America manufacturers will ever have -- the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nIt's an honor to be here to express the gratitude of our President for our nation's manufacturers. You are the engine of the American economy. And rest assured, President Trump is fighting every day to rev that engine. And thanks to his leadership and your ingenuity, American manufacturing is roaring once again. (Applause.)\nBut first, let me express a word of appreciation to all of you and this association and all of your membership. Since your founding more than 120 years ago, the National Association of Manufacturers has fought tirelessly for the time-honored American principles of free enterprise, competitiveness, individual liberty, and equal opportunity.\nAnd not only do you advocate for the businesses in this room -- you really advocate for America itself. American manufacturers are the beating heart of our national life and always will be. (Applause.) To borrow a phrase, manufacturers make America and they make America great. (Applause.)\nYou make the cars on our roads, the planes in our skies. You make the food in our pantries and the tools in our sheds. You make the clothes that we wear and the gadgets we use. When it's all said and done, you make our families and communities stronger. You improve the quality of life -- more prosperity -- and you make America succeed.\nIt's amazing to think that at this very moment, more than 12 million Americans work at manufacturers in all 50 states. The overwhelming majority of manufacturers, too, are small businesses, and they contribute more than $2 trillion to our economy. And all told, manufacturers actually account for three out of every four dollars spent in the private sector on research and development.\nBut you do more than just make things -- you're also model corporate citizens.\nYou know, anyone who's ever gone to a baseball game or a bake sale, or a charity fundraiser or a cook-off at a local farm, or just walked down Main Street small-town America and looked at the names on the buildings and the signs, you see that America's manufacturers support every worthy cause in every community, large and small.\nYou're woven into the very fabric of American life and you're written into our future, too. Know that our President and all the American people are truly grateful for the corporate citizenship of manufacturers across America. Give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.) You make a difference every day. You really do. (Applause.)\nBut we want you to do even more. President Trump has promised, in his words, to \"set the stage for a great revival\" for our factories, to be back to \"Buy American and Hire American\" again. And thanks to the President's decisive action, American manufacturing is getting stronger every day.\nIn the first five months of last year, American manufacturers lost 24,000 jobs. But in the first five months of this year, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, American manufacturers have created more than 55,000 new good-paying jobs all across the United States. (Applause.)\nGoing back decades, manufacturers have invested in jobs and factories in other countries, but this year company after company are making record investments worth billions of dollars in this country, creating American jobs. And as this organization announced in a report released at the White House just a few months ago, American manufacturers haven't been this optimistic in 20 years. Confidence is back. Manufacturing is back. Because since day one of this administration, President Donald Trump has been fighting for manufacturers and the men and women who work on your factory floors, and he'll keep fighting every day to lead an American manufacturing renaissance. I promise you that. (Applause.)\nJust look at the President's decisive action beginning with ending the era of excessive regulation of the past eight years. You know, the National Manufacturers Association -- or the National Association for Manufacturers has shown that federal red tape actually costs your businesses a staggering $19,500 per employee per year.\nIn the first 100 days of this administration, I'm proud to say that President Trump signed 14 bills under the Congressional Review Act to cut burdensome regulations, saving businesses like yours up to $18 billion in compliance cost per year.\nThis President, in fact, has signed more laws to cut through federal red tape than any President in American history -- and we're just getting started. (Applause.)\nOne of my personal favorites is the President signed an executive order directing every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any new federal regulations on American job creators.\nAnd this President put America first not long ago when President Trump made the decision to withdraw the United States of America from the Paris Climate Accord. (Applause.) You know, one independent study found that the Paris Accord would have actually cost the U.S. economy more than 6.5 million manufacturing jobs in the next 25 years while giving countries like China and India virtually a free pass.\nBy withdrawing our nation from this terrible deal, President Trump put America first. He left the door opening to renegotiating the deal or coming up with a different agreement. But he put America first, and I promise the manufacturers in this room that President Donald Trump always will.\nAnd the President has put a renewed emphasis on American energy. He approved the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines early in this administration, and the Dakota Pipeline is already rolling and Keystone is being built as we speak. And President Trump is fighting every day to make sure that American manufacturers have affordable, abundant, and reliable energy that you need to power your factories and power our future. We're going to continue to drive an all-of-the-above energy strategy that gives low-cost energy available for job creators all across America, because energy drives a prosperous American future. (Applause.)\nAnd last week was Workforce Development Week at the White House, and President Trump has been working -- worked very closely with our Department of Labor to ensure that the American people have the opportunity to get the job training to fill those good paying jobs that are open to companies like yours right now, ensuring that workers are there for the companies that can grow and the people can choose their future in our trades and in every area supporting manufacturing.\nIt is remarkable to think that nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs will be created in America in the next decade, but 2 million of those jobs will go unfulfilled [unfilled] if businesses can't find the right people with the right skills. Skilled trades in particular are increasingly hard to come by, we hear. Electricians, welders, machinists are in high demand but too few Americans are given opportunities to pursue careers in these valuable areas.\nPresident Trump is absolutely committed to changing all that. And last Thursday he signed an executive order to expand apprenticeships and vocational training to help every American find a rewarding career, make a great living, support themselves and their families, and to do it in a manufacturing and a building America. (Applause.)\nI mean, the numbers speak for themselves. An amazing 90 percent of apprentices get jobs after they finish their program, and their average salary is an impressive $60,000. As I learned back when I was Governor of the State of Indiana, we need to create better pathways so our students can see the opportunities that are available in these jobs. It's a foundation for a good life and a brighter future for themselves and for our country.\nAnd under this President's leadership, I'm confident that we'll train the students of today for the jobs of tomorrow, and manufacturers like yours are going to continue to grow as a result.\nBut at this White House, with deregulation, with the efforts that we've made rolling back excessive red tape, with doing the kind of work that we've done to promote American energy and to reform workforce education in America -- that's what President Trump just calls a good start.\nIf you haven't noticed, the American people also elected a builder to be the 45th President of the United States. And I'll make you a promise: Before we're done in seven and a half years, President Donald Trump is going to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States of America. (Applause.)\nNow, this is a President who knows that roads mean jobs and the right infrastructure supports growth in America. President Trump is committed to making historic investments in our national infrastructure so your businesses can get your goods to market, and so that America has the best roads, the best bridges, the best airports, and the best future we can possibly have.\nAnd today, I want to assure you, before this summer is over, working with the leaders in the Congress even as we speak, President Donald Trump and this Congress will keep their promise to the American people, and we will repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.) We're going to do it.\nWe're going to rescue American businesses and the American people from the consequences of this failed policy. You all know the grim reality that businesses have faced under Obamacare. I've heard it from manufacturers large and small as I've traveled across the country on behalf of our President.\nIt's the same story everywhere I go: Obamacare stifles your growth; harms your employees through its mandates, its taxes, its endlessly rising costs of insurance and premiums; and forces too many businesses, large and small, to make hard decisions that you just never have to make.\nI literally have spoken to job creators around the country who have told me about the day in their small business that they had to sit their employees down, since Obamacare, and tell them that they just could no longer make it work that they would offer health insurance.\nAnd for anybody that's ever been around a small business -- and I grew up in one -- you know, your employees are family. And it's just heartbreaking to see the choices that too many businesses have had to make in the wake of Obamacare.\nAnd it's not only a heavy burden on your businesses, but Obamacare is burdening the American people every day. You know, last month, our administration issued a study showing how Obamacare has actually led to skyrocketing premiums all across this country. We found that premiums on the individual market have more than doubled since Obamacare went into effect. And in many states, they've more than tripled since Obamacare went into effect.\nRemember, the last administration promised that Obamacare would lower premiums on the individual market by up to $2,500 for American families. Well, the truth is that premiums have actually increased by nearly $3,000 for American families since the advent of Obamacare.\nAt this moment, millions of Americans are facing double-digit premium hikes heading into 2018. And while costs are soaring, choices are plummeting because insurance companies are pulling out of Obamacare exchanges left and right.\nRight now, a third of America's counties, including five whole states, only have one choice of Obamacare coverage, which means they essentially have no choice at all. And in the past few weeks, health insurers have announced exits from at least another 23 Obamacare markets, leaving tens of thousands of Americans with no insurance coverage whatsoever.\nIn Ohio, the last statewide insurer recently announced it would leave Obamacare in the Buckeye State, and more than 13,000 Ohio citizens will have no health insurance next year. In Missouri, 25 counties won't have any coverage under Obamacare.\nAnd while the last insurer in 94 of the 99 counties of Iowa just said that they'll actually stay through next year in the Iowa exchange, just yesterday they submitted a request for a staggering 43 percent increase in premiums, affecting some 72,000 people across Iowa.\nThe record is clear. The burden is great. Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go. (Applause.) And I want to promise you that this administration is literally working around the clock with leaders in the United States Senate to move forward legislation in the very near future that will repeal and replace Obamacare with a patient-centered healthcare system built on personal responsibility, free-market competition, and state-based reform.\nAnd I'll promise you, President Donald Trump will never stop fighting to give American businesses and the American people the kind of healthcare they need and deserve. And under this President's leadership, we will bring the Obamacare nightmare to an end once and for all, and give the American people the choices in healthcare built on the principles of individual responsibility, state-based reform. That's the American way to reform healthcare. And that's what we'll drive and do. (Applause.)\nAnd after we repeal and replace Obamacare, under President Trump's leadership and with the strong support of the leaders in Congress, we're going to pass the largest tax cut since the days of Ronald Reagan. And we're going to do it this year. (Applause.)\nThe truth is, America's tax code is one of the biggest barriers to success for working families and job creators like all of you that are gathered here. You know, I like that line that says, you know, the Internal Revenue Code is twice as long as the Bible, with none of the good news. (Laughter.) Well, that's about to change.\nA little over a month ago, this administration laid out the President's vision for a tax cut plan that will get this economy moving again. We'll cuts taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. We'll simplify the tax code by cutting seven brackets down to three -– 10, 25, and 35 percent. We'll eliminate the alternative minimum tax, end almost every deduction, and under President Donald Trump, we will repeal the death tax once and for all. (Applause.)\nAnd when it comes to businesses, our tax plan will put American companies, like our manufacturers, back on a path to jobs and real growth. You know, our corporate tax rate is one of the highest in the developed world, and our outdated system of worldwide taxation penalizes companies for being headquartered here in America. But not for long.\nPresident Trump's plan: We're going to cut business taxes to a 15 percent rate so American companies can compete with companies around the world. (Applause.) We'll enact a territorial tax that's in line with the rest of the world. And we'll cut taxes on the trillions of dollars that are locked away overseas so that you can invest those dollars in American workers, American jobs, and America's future. (Applause.)\nThe bottom line is that President Trump's tax cut plan will empower your companies to compete on a level playing field with businesses anywhere in the world. And, as we all know, when the field is level, American businesses win.\nLet me take a moment to commend Speaker Paul Ryan and Leader Mitch McConnell for their diligent efforts in this administration. We've been working very closely with the leadership in the Congress to craft tax reform that will get this economy moving again. And I know Speaker Ryan will be addressing you in just a few moments, and we're truly grateful for their diligent efforts working in partnership with this administration to pass the kind of tax relief that will be supportive of American families, supportive of American businesses, and get this economy moving.\nSo let me say to you: Discussions will continue. Details are being worked out. But I can assure you, with your support and the support of our leaders in Congress, we will get tax cuts done and we will get them done this year. (Applause.)\nThe truth is, President Trump has been fighting every day to bring back manufacturing, because he knows how vital you are to the life of our nation. I sure know it. You know, I grew up in the Hoosier State, had the privilege of being Governor of the State of Indiana. And we're awful proud of manufacturing. You know, I like to say back where I come from, we do two things especially well: we make things and we grow things. The truth of the matter is you can talk about America that way too.\nOur nation throughout our history has been defined by the innovation of manufacturing and by the production of agriculture. You're a part of a great tradition in this country. Manufacturing means jobs. It means opportunities. It means prosperity. And the truth is, manufacturing has always been a staple of our economy and it always will be.\nBut let me close by saying that manufacturing is important to America for one more reason -- and it's probably more important than any other reason. You know, yesterday America was heartbroken when we all learned that Otto Warmbier had passed away shortly after being restored to his family from the brutal regime in North Korea. It broke our hearts. The President and Melania, Karen and I offered our condolences and our prayers to Otto's family and friends as they grieve the loss of this fine young man.\nBut be assured, as the President said yesterday, the United States of America condemns \"the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn their latest victim,\" and we deepen our \"administration's determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people\" in the future. (Applause.)\nBut in the midst of that tragic news, earlier this week we learned that seven American sailors lost their lives on duty in the ocean south of Japan. And not long ago, my wife and I put our arms around the families of three Army Rangers who fell in the line of duty in Afghanistan.\nAnd so I close with this thought, among the manufacturers that are gathered here today: In this time of widening challenges and unknowable threats, I want to assure you that you have a President who understands we do not build Navy ships and aircraft and the weapons that defend our freedom; we do not fill the arsenal of democracy without American manufacturing. For America to be prosperous, for America to be secure, American manufacturing must be strong.\nAnd under President Donald Trump, the manufacturers that make America will be strong -– stronger than ever before. Our nation will have the manufacturing infrastructure we need to provide good-paying jobs to promote our prosperity, but also to protect our nation and to ensure a safe and prosperous future for ourselves and our posterity.\nSo I say to you with confidence, to all those gathered here at the National Association of Manufacturers: Together, we will make America prosperous again. Together, we will make America safe again. And to borrow a phrase, together, we will make America great again.\nThank you very much. God bless you. God bless your teams. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-06-20", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at the National Association of Manufacturers Summit"}

Nuclear power is critical to the reliability, security, and diversity of our national energy mix.\nH.R. 1551 would direct the Internal Revenue Service to allocate unutilized portions of the 6,000 national megawatt capacity limitation to eligible advanced nuclear facilities placed in service after December 31, 2020, thereby extending the tax credits prior to the expected in-service date of nuclear reactors currently under construction. In addition, the bill would enable the transfer of credits from public entities to project partners so that the benefit can be realized.\nThe Administration continues to support pro-growth policies, including increased domestic energy production. As the Administration continues to work with Congress on comprehensive tax reform, it will work to simplify the tax code, reduce distortions and lower rates across the board.\nIf H.R. 1551 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.", "timestamp": "2017-06-20", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 1551 - Modifying Advanced Nuclear Power Tax Credit"}
{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126525", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:50 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. Before I get into what the President is going to continue to do to advance the Tech Week that we started, I wanted to shine a spotlight on two of the President's biggest legislative priorities right now -- tax reform and repeal and replace of Obamacare.\nBy the end of the day, both the Vice President and the Speaker of the House will have both delivered remarks at the National Association of Manufacturers about why it's so critical that we come together and quickly deliver significant tax reform to the American people. Simplifying and updating our overly complicated tax system is one of the most impactful ways that we can create jobs and strengthen our economy. And I think that's something that everyone in this town can probably agree upon.\nThere's also major agreement between the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress on what any significant tax reform package must include. And frankly, I saw some of the Democrats earlier today, and I think there are some that share those general philosophies as well. We want to make it easier for companies to sell American goods abroad and turn that success into jobs here at home.\nI think we all will recognize that what I think every American also agrees with, which is that we need to simplify our tax code. Depending on the estimates you look at, taxpayers and businesses spend anywhere between 6 billion to almost 9 billion hours complying with the IRS's requirements. And those are, frankly, billions of hours that they're not building things, growing businesses, buying goods and services from other American businesses, spending time with their families, pursuing a personal hobby. And we must reduce that unnecessary burden in terms of both the burden and the time.\nPerhaps most importantly, we also agree that we need to get this done sooner rather than later. That's why we're working hand-in-hand with House and Senate leadership and hosting regular listening sessions with outside stakeholders -- like the one that's being conducted currently in the Roosevelt Room here at the White House -- with trade associations from the tech industry to iron out details and get their input on what needs to happen.\nWe're also committed to seeing the repeal and replace of Obamacare through Congress. Obviously the Senate is where the action is right now. This week is the deadline for insurers to commit to selling plans on the Obamacare exchange during the upcoming enrollment period. And unfortunately, we're continuing to see signs of its complete failure as data from more and more states comes in.\nLast Friday, the New Mexico Health Connections, one of only five remaining of the 23 co-ops nationwide that was created by Obamacare, proposed hiking its rates by nearly 80 percent. And just today in Iowa, where the President will be traveling tomorrow, the only insurer left in the Obamacare exchange proposed a 43 percent rate hike for next year.\nWith almost every day that passes, another insurer either leaves the market or raises its rates by double digits. The American people can't afford to front the bill for this failed law a single day longer. It's time to repeal and replace Obamacare, as Republicans have promised for a while.\nLooking ahead this week, Tech Week, as I mentioned at the front, continues, following on a very productive set of meetings and working groups with some of the country's biggest CEOs yesterday. The President will visit Cedar Rapids, Iowa tomorrow, where he'll see firsthand the transformative power of technological innovations in agriculture at Kirkwood Community College. Kirkwood's agriculture science program is a national leader and widely recognized as a center for innovation in the ag sector.\nAnd on Thursday, we're bringing two emerging technologies to the White House that have the potential to revolutionize our economy -- drones and universal broadband. The President will see demonstrations of how these technologies will contribute to the 21st century economy and how the government can ensure that their safe adoption leads to the best possible outcomes for the American worker and American businesses.\nWith that, I'll take some questions.\nKatie.\nQ: My first question is, does the administration have anything to say to China about the death of Otto Warmbier?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think the President has spoken very clearly about how he, the First Lady, and our country feels about the loss of this American. And obviously, when you look at how he was handled, it's something that we will continue to apply economic and political pressure, and try to continue to work with our allies. We've had, I think, positive movement on China over the past five months of this administration, and we'll continue to work with them and others to put the appropriate pressure on North Korea to change this behavior and this regime.\nSteve.\nQ: Sean, following up on the President's meeting with the Ukraine President. Would the President like to see Russia get out of Eastern Ukraine? And does he see Moscow as the aggressor in this conflict?\nMR. SPICER: I think we've been clear that, yeah, I mean, obviously that's part of the reason that there are sanctions, is because until they are out of Eastern Ukraine, we're going to continue to have sanctions on Russia. And we believe that that is Ukraine's -- a part of Ukraine and so, therefore, until -- those sanctions will remain. It was something that obviously came up in discussion with the President today, and we'll continue to advocate for that.\nQ: And does the President support the Senate sanctions that have now been moved to the House?\nMR. SPICER: I think we're going to wait and see what happens in the House before we weigh in on that package. It's not just the package; I think there's some other areas of that package that we need to work with the House and Senate on if it comes back -- depending on how it's handled in the House -- that we have to address. But, as is usually the case, we won't have a statement of administrative policy until it advances through the House.\nJessica.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. How does the U.S. -- can you talk about what the U.S. is willing to do in retaliation for Otto Warmbier's death with respect to sanctions of the United Nations or whatever? And secondly, with the U.S.-China security and defense dialogues beginning tomorrow, it's already been stated that the North Korea issue is going to be at the top of the agenda. Do you anticipate walking away from tomorrow's dialogue with any kind of tangible results on North Korea?\nMR. SPICER: We have been very forceful in our political and economic pressure that has been applied in North Korea. I think we'll continue to apply that. And as I mentioned earlier, obviously, China can play -- has played and can continue to play a greater role in helping to resolve this situation, and we will continue to hopefully build on the relationship and the dialogue that we've had with China. I think there have been some positive steps that they've taken, both at the U.N. and economically, to help strengthen the case against North Korea.\nBut I'm not going to get ahead of where we may or may not go. And obviously, we hope that those discussions with China are productive and continue to move us forward.\nGabby.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. There were some reports out that President Trump told members of that tech meeting yesterday that the Senate healthcare bill needed to have more heart. Can you shed some light on what it is he's not pleased with in the legislation that's being drafted? And can you also tell us why he would feel that way after holding a press conference in the Rose Garden supporting the House's version of the healthcare bill?\nMR. SPICER: I mean, the President clearly wants a bill that has heart in it. He believes that healthcare is something that is near and dear to so many families and individuals. He made it clear from the beginning that that was one of his priorities. And as the Senate works its way through this bill, as the House did, any ideas are welcome to strengthen it, to make it more affordable, more accessible, and deliver the care that it needs.\nBut this is an area that the President believes passionately about. He cares. He understands the role that healthcare plays in so many people's lives and their families, and he wants to make sure that we do everything we can to provide the best option for him as Obamacare continues to fail.\nQ: Is there a specific part of this bill, though, that leads him to believe that the Senate is doing something --\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to get -- again, this is an ongoing discussion with Senate leaders and individual senators that he's had. You know that we've brought a lot of those individuals to the White House, and there's been staff-level meetings as well -- Secretary Price and others.\nSo I'm not going to get into the private discussions that have occurred. But I will just say that the more that we can do produce a bill as it works its way through the process that achieves the President's goals, I think that's something that we can all agree on.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two, the first one is domestic. There's a special election occurring today in Georgia. Is this election, from the White House's point of view, a referendum on the President in any way?\nMR. SPICER: Look, I've said before I'm not going to comment on the political nature of an ongoing race. That being said, I think if you look historically, special elections generally don't foretell the outcome of races multiple years down the road. This is a race that the President -- or a district that the President won by one point. It's obviously going to be competitive. But we'll have to see tonight. Obviously, that's up to the people of Georgia's 6th district to decide.\nQ: And then on North Korea, I think the President once said that he'd be open to meeting with Kim Jong-un. Given what has happened with Otto Warmbier over the course of the past 24 hours, is he still open to that?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I believe that the context in which he said that was if the conditions -- if the right conditions presented themselves. Clearly, we're moving further away, not closer, to those conditions being -- enact. So I would not suggest that we're moving any closer. And obviously, this is an issue that the President commented earlier at the beginning of the meeting with President Poroshenko that troubles him deeply.\nAnd he believes that if we had -- were able to get -- we're pleased, obviously, to get Otto back to the United States to be with his family. But if we had been able to secure that earlier, potentially, there could have been medical help that could have been rendered earlier. Obviously we don't know the answer to that, but I think the President worked really hard to do what he could to secure the release of him, and it's a shame what happened to him. I think he was very clear about that when he spoke to members of the media earlier today.\nVivian.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two questions, also on Otto. The President today said that he thinks it's terrible what happened to Otto. Does he have any more details -- do you have any more details on specifically what he endured there?\nMR. SPICER: I do not. And we would not share them at this point.\nQ: And second question. There are reports that your role is changing here at the White House. I wanted to know if you can address those reports. Are they true or not, and if so, can you tell us what's in store?\nMR. SPICER: I'm right here. So you can keep taking your selfies and selfie photos. (Laughter.) But, look, it's no secret we've had a couple vacancies, including our communications director is gone for a while. We've been seeking input from individuals as far as ideas that they have. We've been meeting with potential people that may be of service to this administration. I don't think that should come as any surprise. But we're always looking for ways to do a better job of articulating the President's message and his agenda, and we'll continue to have those discussions internally. When we have an announcement of a personnel nature we'll let you know. That's a good deal.\nGoing to go to Dave Price of WHO in Iowa in light of tomorrow's visit.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. You already mentioned the President is coming. We understand that our longtime governor and now Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, will be there with him. The President has already praised Ambassador Branstad's longtime relationship with China's President Xi. As you know, the President has a certain style -- the way he tweets and talks -- and that doesn't exactly mirror the way Terry Branstad has had his career. In light of that, how do you see this dynamic playing out in Ambassador Branstad's role with China?\nMR. SPICER: Thanks, Dave. Tomorrow, as you noted, the President will be joined by Governor Branstad at Kirkwood to not just discuss some of the agriculture aspects of what's going to be discussed, but also talk about trade. I think he was clearly impressed with Governor Branstad -- as Chuck Grassley put it, he's been an ambassador for Iowa for decades, if not his whole life. And I think the President feels those skillsets, his understanding of China, and his dedication to help us support U.S. products and agricultural goods and other stuff, services, to China in particular is going to be a huge asset for the United States.\nHe chose Governor Branstad because he was impressed with what he had done as ambassador -- as governor in Iowa, and the respect that he has for the people of Iowa I think is going to serve this country well.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I want to circle back on the Georgia 6th. Is it fair to say the President will be watching with great interest the race that happens tonight? And what's his message -- I know he had a couple tweets -- what's his message to the people of the Peach State as they consider the direction for that particular district? And if I could follow up.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, so, just so we're clear, I'm not going to comment on political races. That being said, as I've noted before, it's no surprise that the President is going to support Republicans up and down the ticket, especially to maintain our majorities in the House and the Senate as we move forward. So obviously, as you noted, he has tweeted about that and believes that there is a clear and stark choice. But I'll leave it at that.\nQ: Let me ask you about the communications shop here. I know that you are probably wearing more than one hat at the moment and yet there's been a great deal of unrest certainly in this room and perhaps in other spaces about a lack of press briefings, a lack of communication with you directly outside of, say, the office. I just wanted to know if you would sort of unpack the idea behind fewer on-camera briefings, just to sort of help make sense of what's going on.\nMR. SPICER: Sure. I mean, what I will tell you is -- I've said it multiple times prior to actually taking the job in December and January -- explained that we're going to do what we can to communicate our message. We have a tremendous respect for the First Amendment -- your ability to do your job and report and seek out ideas -- and we're going to work with you. I think the briefing is one aspect of what we do. We're here really early in the morning and really late at night, available to all of your questions, whether it's email or in-person. This is one avenue to do that.\nWe've, as you noted, opened up Skype questions to bring more people into the briefing room. But we have done multiple more opportunities for people to interact with the President, according to several folks that have been here for several administrations. We've looked at a lot of data that suggests when you look at the number of availabilities and interviews that the President has given, it's pretty significant compared to past administrations.\nSo I think that while you guys will always advocate for greater transparency and more access, I think that we have done a very good job of not just providing opportunities here at a daily briefing but also making ourselves available as a staff almost 24 hours a day when it comes down to it. And I think you look at the steps that we've taken to give access to reporters and I do think it's pretty significant.\nI understand you'll always have issues, you'll always want more, and that's fair. I think that's your right. That's what a lot of the press is there to advocate for. You have an association that does that as well. And I think you'll continue to fight for it. We'll continue to do our job and hopefully -- but I do believe that if you look holistically, you'll see that we have a staff that's very accommodating, tries to get to and responsive to your questions.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two questions. Yesterday, the Canadian premier was in town to talk NAFTA. And he met, among others, Secretary Ross and the Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin --\nMR. SPICER: Kentucky.\nQ: I'll let you say it.\nMR. SPICER: Well, no, I just thought you said Connecticut.\nQ: No. (Laughter.) The Governor said that he needs good-quality aluminum. His homebuilders need good quality softwood lumber. Is the President receptive to this type of argument in negotiation with NAFTA?\nMR. SPICER: You mean with respect to Canada?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. SPICER: Look, I think that Wilbur Ross and the Department of Commerce have made it very clear with the softwood lumber case that they want to get a better deal for our country. I understand the Governor's point and we're going to continue to work through the proper channels in dispute resolution settlement to get that to achieve our goals and the concerns that we have are settled correctly through the mechanism that exists.\nSpeaking of Kentucky -- hold on.\nQ: Today is World Refugee Day. Does the President feel that refugees are a threat to American security?\nMR. SPICER: I think the first and foremost thing the President is concerned about -- obviously, you take an area like Syria, for example. He's been very focused on trying to get countries to agree to work together on creating safe zones, because refugees, for the most -- in a lot of areas would rather be in their country where they're from, safely, have a place to raise their family, and not be resettled. That's our number-one goal for them in those cases.\nBut number two is, I think the President has also been very clear his number-one goal as Commander-in-Chief is to protect our country, our homeland, and our people, and that he needs to make sure that people coming into this country are doing so through peaceful means. And so his number-one priority, as the number-one priority of any leader is, is to protect their people, first and foremost.\nBut then, obviously, as we look throughout the globe and find areas and regions that need support, we've tried to work through diplomatic and economic channels to create solutions.\nSpeaking of Kentucky, I'm going to go to Will Clark, who's at WHAS.\nQ: Sean, thanks for taking my question. My question is about the administration's position on coal. The administration had, during the campaign, said they wanted to bring back coal jobs to eastern Kentucky, and now there's a lot of those coal miners in that part of the state who are saying that they want tech jobs. They're going back to college to get the skills for those jobs. Does the administration still support the return of coal to those portions of eastern Kentucky and into West Virginia?\nAnd what is the President's relationship with Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin? I know he was at the White House last week and was also at the nominating convention in Cleveland, among other places.\nMR. SPICER: He has been here a few times. I think they have a fantastic relationship. Governor Bevin has been a great advocate. He's done a lot in Kentucky to grow jobs and really fight for innovation down there. And I know that his ideas and his input have been very well received here at the White House, and we want to continue to work with him.\nI think with respect to your question, Will, it's not really a binary choice. I think the President wants to continue to, and has supported several measures, to really restore the coal industry and to bring it back.\nAnd to touch on the theme of this week, we want to do what we can to really focus on technology, helping our government bring back jobs, create new opportunities for our country, for jobs. We talked about this a couple weeks ago when we talked about workforce development -- or only a week ago, I guess. But part of it is to make sure that people have the training and the skills that they need, whether that's going to a vocational school or another training opportunity that gives them the skills in an area like high-tech and technology to pursue a new change in life or a new career or just at a high school.\nBut we need to make sure that we have the training and the support, the loan system, et cetera, that will support people who want to go into a lot of these fields.\nSo I don't think it's a choice of one industry over another. Obviously, the President has and will continue to do a lot to support coal, especially the clean coal industry, and at the same time make sure that we have opportunities to give the workforce of the next century, or Americans the skillset to compete. And that's something that Secretary Acosta spoke from this podium on extensively last week.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Has the President seen a draft of the Senate healthcare bill?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know that. I know that there was some chatter today. I know the President has been on the phone extensively with the leader and with key senators, so I don't know if he's seen the legislation or not. But I know that they've been working extremely hard, and the President has been giving his input and his ideas and feedback to them, and he's very excited about where this thing is headed.\nQ: Do you know if anyone on his staff has seen the draft of the bill?\nMR. SPICER: I don't. I know that they are up there working hand-in-glove with them. So to the extent that it's -- I don't even know where we are in terms of a final plan. I know that the staff has been working very closely with the leader's staff, with Senate Finance and others. So I don't want to get ahead of announcement on Senator McConnell saying when the final product is done. So I will refer you back to him.\nJen.\nQ: I have kind of two questions, if that's okay.\nMR. SPICER: Of course.\nQ: So the first one is just -- in the last few minutes, Gary Cohn spoke in a meeting and kind of laid out a September timeline for a bill on tax reform to actually get to the floor of Congress. Is that realistic? As far as timelines go, we've heard a lot of different things. I keep getting pushback. We still haven't seen -- we haven't gotten to a final vote on healthcare, let alone all the other things that have been talked about. Do you think that that's actually going to be a realistic timeline?\nMR. SPICER: I think we're working really hard. I think you saw the Speaker and the Vice President, as I mentioned at the top, both talk about this. There's a strong commitment to doing it, and I think it's, frankly, bicameral and bipartisan. I saw Senator Warner from Virginia earlier today talking about his concerns with the corporate tax rate and the need for it to come down to the 20s. That's great. We would welcome his support on a package like this.\nSo I think that there is going to be very bipartisan, bicameral support for tax reform. And as we move forward on this, the degree to which we can get some of those individuals to join in and craft a bill, we'll determine the schedule. But I think that's mostly a congressional timetable that we have to move with.\nQ: And will there be outreach to Democrats in that timetable?\nMR. SPICER: I think they've already met with some Democrats and they'll continue to. But I don't -- that has been part of the plan; it's already been part of the plan. And they'll continue to reach out to members of Congress that share these goals.\nQ: And the other question, just on -- Ford today announced that they're going to be building this new factory in China. The President, one, kind of was very -- kind of declared victory when this plant was not going to be built in Mexico. So, one, is there an administration reaction to their decision to go there? And then, two, there's been some signs that the administration wanted to get tougher on China. Are we going to see that from you all?\nMR. SPICER: Well, with respect to your first question, Secretary Ross has put out a statement with respect to Ford's decision. And I think the general consensus is that the President wants to create a tax system that companies want to come back and bring back jobs in manufacturing here in the United States.\nAnd once we can pass that plan you just asked about, that really gets our companies more competitive, doesn't leave them with the highest tax rate, and also deals with a lot of other aspects about our business tax code that puts them at a disadvantage to their foreign competitors, then I think you're going to see more and more companies not just go to other countries, but come back to the United States, grow in the United States, manufacture more in the United States. And that's where I think, overall, we continue to see the need to have tax reform to achieve those results.\nSarah.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The President, today, said that if Otto Warmbier had been brought home sooner the results would have been a lot different. Does the President believe that the Obama administration is partly responsible for what happened to Otto Warmbier?\nMR. SPICER: The President was pleased that he was able to work with the State Department and get Otto home as soon as he could. But I think when you realize what happened, the President believes that had it happened sooner or quicker, potentially there might have been additional medical resources that could have been provided. He was just obviously saddened by this entire situation and just would have hoped that it could have been resolved earlier.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I just want to ask -- the House Freedom Caucus have suggested that the August recess should either be scrapped or just greatly shortened so more business could be done, to ensure the Obamacare repeal bill through, make the first steps on tax reform. Is that something that the President could support, scrapping or shortening the August recess?\nMR. SPICER: I think that's going to be up to the House and the Senate to determine their recesses. They don't -- generally, we don't get involved in their scheduling. So I'll let Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell decide what's appropriate in terms of their --\nQ: Is the President satisfied with the pace that Congress is --\nMR. SPICER: If we continue to move forward with healthcare the way that we've been told we're going to and that -- then I think we're great. We've got our priorities. We want to get healthcare done. We want to get tax reform done. And obviously the President has spoken very extensively about infrastructure. If we can get those done, I think we feel very good.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: We'll go as quick as Congress wants. It's a little out of our hands. But as soon as Congress can do it, we'll do what we can. You saw when the President -- when the House had its bill up, the President worked feverishly to make sure that he did everything he could to get it over the finish line. I think we'll do the same for all of those other scenarios as well.\nHallie.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. I want to follow up on healthcare there. You were around when Republicans were criticizing Democrats back in the day of Obamacare for being, as you put it fairly recently, jammed down people's throats. You said it was rushed, it was secret -- that was the criticism. So how is what's happening now with this bill getting crafted frankly behind closed doors any different from what Republicans criticized Democrats for doing?\nMR. SPICER: I think we wanted to be part of the process back then. If you look at what --\nQ: Are Democrats part of the process --\nMR. SPICER: You look at what Senator Schumer said both in February to a MoveOn.org call, where he said that no one is going to be -- no Democrat is going to go near this, and what he said in a letter on May 9th -- he said that no Democrats would be part of an effort that would repeal Obamacare. So they have chosen to take themselves -- to not make themselves part of this process.\nThere is -- when Senator McConnell brings the bill forward, I'm sure that there will be plenty of time to have debate. It's the Senate; there's always plenty of time to debate.\nQ: He said -- next week.\nMR. SPICER: Okay, but again, I'm not going to get ahead of -- I'll let Senator McConnell determine the Senate schedule and run the Senate that he sees fit. But let's not mistake ourselves with how they approached this thing. Their leader, Senator Schumer, made it very clear on at least two separate occasions that they didn't want to be part of this process. They didn't want to repeal and replace Obamacare. They were happy with Obamacare.\nWe believe Obamacare is failing. We want a better system for the American people, a patient-centric healthcare system that brings down costs and gives more accessibility to people. That's it. They chose not to -- made it very clear that they didn't want to engage in this process. So to turn around now and to second-guess -- that's something they should take up with their own leader.\nQ: On North Korea, does the President support a travel ban to those heading to North Korea? And given Senator McCain's comments that he believes Otto Warmbier was murdered, is it this administration's position that North Korea killed that young man?\nMR. SPICER: On the first one, I think the State Department is mulling additional advisories, and I'll leave it to them. That's how -- our travel restrictions and such is run through the State Department, so I'd refer you to them.\nAnd again, I don't want to, before anything further goes on with respect to him, I'm not going to comment on whether or not his situation, how it was handled, until we have further information on that.\nTrey.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Two questions for you. Public perspective on the administration -- how transparent have lawmakers been on Capitol Hill when drafting this healthcare bill?\nMR. SPICER: How what?\nQ: How transparent have they been?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think that we've had a very robust discussion with lawmakers, first in the House and now in the Senate, who have ideas and input. But, ultimately, each of those bills is the product of their own chamber. I mean, the House -- we obviously had plenty of sessions with members of the House as they moved forward. We've done a lot in the Senate. But each of those chambers runs their own chamber respectively by the leadership they have. It's not our job to go in and dictate how they do it.\nWe have tried to be as helpful as we can throughout this process by highlighting the need for repealing and replacing a failed system, and we'll continue to do that. But it's not for me to get up and talk about how their process works through each of their respective chambers.\nQ: Can I follow up on Steve's question on Russian sanctions? Just very plainly, a yes or no answer, does President Trump believe that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 elections?\nMR. SPICER: I have not sat down and talked to him about that specific thing. Obviously we've been dealing with a lot of other issues today. I'd be glad to touch base.\nQ: Generally speaking, in his conversation about Russian interference in our elections, there's 16 intelligence agencies that say that they did. The former FBI director said that without a doubt, the Russians --\nMR. SPICER: I understand. I've seen the reports.\nQ: Does the President share those views?\nMR. SPICER: I have not sat down and asked him about his specific reaction to them, so I'd be glad to touch base and get back to you.\nQ: Didn't he say it was fake news, Sean? Didn't the President say that Russia was fake news?\nQ: Sean, regarding the President's Cuba policy, the Cuban foreign minister just yesterday said that it is \"a grotesque spectacle.\" Does the President have any reaction to that?\nMR. SPICER: The policy the President laid out for Cuba first and foremost is something that will help the Cuban people. It will stop making -- encouraging payments to the military and help them economically lift themselves up. That is the greatest form of human rights that we can push for right now, to make sure that those efforts that we do and that the American citizens who travel or do business in Cuba follow the law.\nOur goal is to make sure that the policies for this government first and foremost help the Cuban people.

That's a great honor and a great pleasure to be together with you, dear Mr. President—one of the most reliable supporters and partners—strategic partners for Ukraine.\nWe're really fighting to bring freedom and democracy, and with your very strong support in security and defense—support of our defense, support of my 45 million nation, of the country who is the biggest in the European continent.

WALTERS: Good evening, everybody. As you all know, we're on our way to Cedar Rapids, where the President will highlight precision agriculture and discuss trade. Lots of people associate technology with only Silicon Valley, but, actually, there are many other sectors of our economy that are taking advantage of technological advances, including agriculture.\nWe're going to be visiting Kirkwood Community College, which is one of the first programs to have an associate's degree is precision agriculture. The President, along with Secretary Perdue, Secretary Ross, and Ambassador Branstad will be engaging with some of the people who are bringing cutting-edge technology to the ag sector.\nWith me today I have Secretary Perdue. I'm going to walk you through the rest of the evening, take a few questions, and then I will hand it over to the Secretary to give you more in-depth details on how technology plays an active role in the agriculture sector and the importance of us being in Iowa.\nToday, while we're in Iowa, you're going to hear the President talk about this precision agriculture and what it means for the agricultural community to be advancing to the technological age of tomorrow, and how this is going to help farmers ensure the highest yield of crop production each year.\nThis is not only about the equipment, it's also about the data that they're going to be able to collect. And with this data, one component is Internet access availability -- you know, Internet connectivity -- are you able to take this data that you're collecting and then be able to do something with it.\nAnd so you're going to hear in the President's speech later today not only the discussion around the importance of advancing agriculture, but also this broadband connectivity in rural communities so that they have the access to modern-day technology both in the equipment and when it comes to cellular usage and data. And so what he's going to be doing is reinforcing his commitment to working with Congress to do what's needed to be able to help bring you this Internet connectivity to rural communities, as well as, as you all know, we are sending off the favored son of Iowa, former Governor Branstad.\nAnd so the President is going to be bidding him farewell while we are at the event at Kirkwood College. While there, he will highlight the fact that, as Senator Grassley said, Branstad has been an ambassador for the people of Iowa. And now going to China as a skilled negotiator, he will be an ambassador for all American people as he looks at trade. And that's an important thing -- the President has spoken to the importance that trade holds for the American people and that relationship -- to have an ambassador with such skills over in China, advocating for all American people.\nSo with that, I will take your questions.\nQ: Has the President given up on trying to get China to help out with North Korea?\nMS. WALTERS: I'm not going to project what -- the President is not going to project his strategy. And tweets speak for themselves.\nQ: Is he going to announce some sort of a new program or policy today in his speeches, either at Kirkwood or at the rally?\nMS. WALTERS: I'm not going to get ahead of what the President's speeches are going to be at the rally or Kirkwood. What I can tell you is that, at Kirkwood Community College, he is going to highlight precision agriculture, as well as this commitment to work with Congress on increasing broadband connectivity for rural communities in order to bring them up to the current and the day and age of tomorrow in terms of technology.\nQ: How did the President's tweet about giving up on China affect the Secretary of State's meeting with the Chinese?\nMS. WALTERS: I'm not going to weigh into the impact of tweets. What I can tell you is we're not going to project the President's strategy publicly.\nQ: A number of Democrats have called for Jared Kushner's security clearance to be suspended in the midst of this investigation. Does the White House have any plans to do that or turn over the documents they've requested?\nMS. WALTERS: That's something I'll have to get back to you on.\nQ: Does the President think that the special election in Georgia was a personal victory?\nMS. WALTERS: The President is obviously happy with both of the wins. This just shows that the American people are resonating with the President's agenda and that they want to advance the President's agenda -- that the American people care about having a better healthcare system that works for all Americans; for bringing jobs back to America; growing our economy; and making sure that our nation is safe. So both wins in Georgia and South Carolina show that the American people want the President's agenda enacted and they want the people of Washington to work with the President.\nQ: Lindsay, we have a few issues outstanding. Do you have any updates on the Comey tapes, whether the President has seen the Senate healthcare bill, or his views on climate change?\nMS. WALTERS: In terms of the Comey tapes, I don't have anything further than what Sean had, other than I can tell you there will be something this week.\nAs for the Senate -- the healthcare bill, the appropriate individuals have seen the bill. The President had 13 senators over last week for dinner. The Vice President has been going weekly to the Senate lunches where the focus of conversation has largely been on healthcare, as well as the presentations. And the President's legislative team has been working with the Senate leadership's team as well as the members over on the Senate side. And the President has received a full brief from his legislative team.\nQ: And the other one was climate change.\nMS. WALTERS: What about climate change?\nQ: If he still believes it's a hoax.\nMS. WALTERS: I have nothing further than what's been said on that before, that the President believes that climate does affect things -- some good, some bad.\nQ: Lindsay, the President was briefed before we left on the incident in Flint, Michigan. Do you have any specifics about what he was briefed on? Does the President believe it's terrorist-related? Anything specific?\nMS. WALTERS: The President was briefed on the situation. As for any further details, I'll need to get back to you on that.\nQ: The Congressional Black Caucus voted to decline an invitation to have a follow-up meeting with the President. Does the White House have a response to that?\nMS. WALTERS: I saw that come in slightly before walking back here. I'll need to look into our official response. But I do know that the President had the leadership, and there was an invitation extended to all the membership. And I will get back to you on our response.\nQ: Is the President going to meet Vladimir Putin at the G20 Summit coming up in two weeks?\nMS. WALTERS: I don't have an announcement at this time. When we do, I will let you know.\nQ: I'm not sure if this was the Flynn question, but is there any response to the fact -- the reports that Flynn did not report a 2015 trip to Saudi Arabia, possibly about building nuclear reactors?\nMS. WALTERS: I'm going to need to refer you to Kasowitz for anything Russia-related.\nQ: On the Russian probe, has staff been given any guidance on whether they should hire their own personal attorneys? Do you know if Reince or Sean have -- or Bannon have their own attorneys yet?\nMS. WALTERS: I'm not going to comment on what individuals inside the White House have decided to do. You're going to need to ask those individuals. And even furthermore, I would recommend you reach out to Marc Kasowitz.\nQ: We know that he talked to King Salman. Has he talked to the Crown Prince in Saudi Arabia yet -- the new Crown Prince? Do you know?\nMS. WALTERS: I'll look into that. You know, he has obviously spoken (inaudible) but I'll look into the further details.\nAll right? With that, I'm going to hand it over to Secretary Perdue, who can walk you through a few updates at the Department of Agriculture, as well as talk a little bit more about the importance of us being in Iowa and how this impacts rural communities.\nSECRETARY PERDUE: Lindsay has given you so good a briefing on ag technology, there's nothing else for me to say. (Laughter.) You did a great job.\nOftentimes, when we think of technology and science being in other fields, you're going to amazed that you see some of the products here in Iowa, in this community college, over self-driving combines and the kind of data that's collected through these combines go through the fields. So science and technology have played a huge part in the productive capacity of American agriculture over the last several years, whether it's genetic engineering or actually the connectivity through the Internet usage that's so needed.\nAnd as Lindsay said, that's why the President is so involved in the rural connectivity of broadband because most of our farms are obviously in rural areas, and they need this connectivity to feed into big data that helps them to make better decisions over precision agriculture.\nWhat is precision agriculture? It's using less resources, less inputs, less water, less fertilizer, less insecticides, less pesticides in order to produce a better, healthier, more wholesome crop. And that's why it's so important, as we learn how to produce better crops with less inputs, making a less carbon imprint, less resources there for the world. So that's why it's important there.\nThe trade aspect is also important. I just left yesterday -- actually, this morning -- from a meeting with my counterparts in Mexico and Canada, Minister MacAulay of Canada and Secretary Calzada of Mexico. We had a very good relationship. It was just kind of a personal trust-building relationship as we begin the NAFTA negotiations. We began to talk, really, as a neighborhood would, as a neighborhood of North America. And we laid out -- their wives were there and my wife was there.\nSo it was a great building relationship to develop the basis for discussions when maybe some of the discussions are not as comfortable as that -- when we have to discuss issues that we need to have very candid and direct family conversations about. We laid that background this past two days.\nWe took them to Savannah, Georgia to show them the fastest-growing container port in the United States and how ag products, both inbound and outbound -- it's a very balanced port -- about 50 percent imports, 50 percent exports. And we showed them the coal storage that the products coming in from Mexico do. We even transshipped some things, railed down from Canada out to the Southeast Asia and that area as well.\nSo it was very productive. We went inland and they saw actual farm technology, some of which we'll see today, of direct farm -- field-to-table aspects of farmers growing and processing greens and Vidalia onions and those types of things; sweet potatoes right there in a safe environment. Food safety with FSMA laws and regulations, and showing how they comply was a very interesting thing for our friends.\nWe talked about the standardization of food safety and food modernization regulations to make sure that, if we're going to trade trilaterally with free trade, each of us has to be sure that food safety is a zero tolerance issue, and to standardize our standards with animal, plant, health and safety, and our food safety inspection systems with the equivalency in Mexico and Canada.\nSo they were very productive discussions. We laid a great groundwork, I think, to begin a relationship of maybe issues that may not be as comfortable in the future.\nQ: For Internet in rural areas, would you like to see more federal spending to make that happen?\nSECRETARY PERDUE: As we know, the productivity or the profitability in less-dense areas is very difficult. But we also know that this country created the Rural Electrification Association years ago in an obligation to serve. We know most everyone in the country can get a dial tone today. We think we ought to have the same push to have broadband connectivity all over the country, because in the 21st century, it's just as important as a telephone, just as important as water, sewer, or roads. It has become an infrastructure of necessity in rural areas as we've described how technology is driving agriculture.\nDoes that mean that it's going to be -- I think government will have to help, whether it's local government, states government, or the federal government. But we want partnerships. We want people that have skin in the game. These are going to be revenue streams coming in. People are going to pay for these services, but we've got to help ignite that and kick-start that in order to make sure it gets where it need to be.\nQ: How much would it cost, do you think, to get it started?\nSECRETARY PERDUE: I'm sorry?\nQ: How much would it cost?\nSECRETARY PERDUE: We don't know yet. We're actually developing proposals now with our rural broadband connectivity, independent telephone systems, rural cooperatives there. We gave a loan for about $46 million, I think, two weeks ago to some of our rural cooperatives in order to get that started. So we haven't calculated how much. It's a big price tag, but who shares what part of that will probably differ from place to place.\nQ: So there's not a plan yet for rural broadband? In other words, you're in the beginning stages of trying to figure out how you're going to do it, or --\nSECRETARY PERDUE: I don't think you're going to see a national plan, per se, because each area is different. Each area has different services now. Some are served by independent telephone companies that are already providing some of these services. How we help them extend that in the more rural areas will be different in every area.\nSo there's not going to be a national footprint. We're going to take every area. That's what our department at the Rural Development USDA will do in working with the resources that we have, the assets out in every area of the country in order to make broadband -- rural broadband as ubiquitous as we can.\nQ: But ag takes the lead on rural broadband. Is that the idea?\nSECRETARY PERDUE: (Inaudible), along with Chairman Ajit Pai of FCC, we're in communication. He was part of our rural taskforce last week along with 21 other agencies that came together to talk about rural prosperity and the barriers for rural prosperity to catch up with the urban areas regarding their livelihoods.\nQ: Secretary Perdue, just a quick -- can you give us your assessment of the wins in both Georgia and South Carolina? I know you were down there and you know that area well. What is your assessment of them?\nSECRETARY PERDUE: I think -- again, I think it was an affirmation from the base of people, of the majority of people affirming President Trump's agenda. As you know, the Democrats wanted to make this a referendum on President Trump's agenda, and we agreed with that. And I think when you see the vote totals of 53-47, I think the majority of people indicate they want him to move forward. They want Congress to move forward with his agenda. I think that's exactly what the vote was. There was no doubt about it.\nThey began making it a referendum. You know, make Trump furious was their first comments. And then I think it made Republicans furious. But they want to see President Trump's agenda carried out not only nationally but certainly within the congressional action as well.\nQ: And then quickly --\nMS. WALTERS: I think we have to head back. We're about to land.\nEND 5:27 P.M.

Thank you to Attorney General Sessions for that warm welcome and warm introduction. And let me say -- let me say thank you -- thank you to this Attorney General for your leadership at the Department of Justice. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a law-and-order Attorney General. And I and the President are proud and honored to have him at our side. (Applause.)\nIt's truly an honor to be here at the National Summit of Crime Reduction and Public Safety. And I'm bringing greetings this morning from a tireless champion of the men and women of law enforcement in the United States of America, the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nFrom the very start of this administration, President Trump has promised to support, in his words, the men and women of law enforcement and to support you strongly, and to protect every American's right to live in safety and in peace. And since literally the first day of this administration, President Trump has been busy keeping that promise to the American people and all of you.\nIn one of his earliest acts, the President established the first-ever Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety, with the goal of fostering collaboration between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement to improve the safety of our peace officers and the safety of the American people. This very summit is an extension of the President's leadership and that task force efforts. And the discussions that you're having will impact the policies of this administration and impact this country for years to come.\nThe President and I are pleased also, as all of you learned yesterday from Attorney General Sessions, that 12 cities have already joined the new National Public Safety Partnership with the Justice Department. The resources that will be available through this partnership will empower cities to identify the best tools and the best strategies to take on gangs, to take on the drug dealers, and take back their cities from the scourge of violent crime.\nLet's take a moment to congratulate the 12 chiefs of police who are here with us today who are providing that leadership in these 12 communities in America. We thank you. (Applause.)\nAnd let me thank you all for attending this historic gathering. At every level of American law enforcement that's represented here -- and many important community groups are a part of the discussions that will take place -- allow me to express the pride and appreciation of the dedicated public servants of the Justice Department in particular who are here with us today from the DEA, the ATF, the FBI, the United States Marshals Service, and of course, the United States Attorneys. Can we give them a round of applause? We are proud of these public servants and the service they provide to the American people. (Applause.)\nAnd to all the advocates here today, especially the advocates for victims and the advocates for those who have fallen in the line of duty and their families, thank you. Just thank you for your compassion. Thank you for being here today. Thank you for pouring yourselves into the lives of the families of our fallen and those who have suffered the weight of violent crime in America. You make a difference every day, and your efforts, in my heart, are treasure in heaven. Let's give them a round of applause. (Applause.)\nAnd lastly, thank you to all the police chiefs, the sheriffs, the detectives, and other members of local, state, and tribal law enforcement who have traveled near and far to attend this summit. You are the best of us. And on behalf of President Donald Trump and the American people, thank you for the service that you and your families provide every single day to keep American families safe.\nJust last week, the entire world was awed when two of your kind, in the midst of a terrible attack on a congressional baseball team, demonstrated the courage that men and women in law enforcement demonstrate every week across this country. As officers do all across America far too often, these two heroes rushed into danger without regard to their personal safety. It's truly remarkable to hear the story.\nI was speaking yesterday to a senator who was there on the scene. He talked about how the gunman rounded behind home plate, and there was literally nothing in between him and a dugout where there were members of Congress, and even the child of a member of Congress with nothing between them and the gunman with a semiautomatic weapon. And those two officers, both of whom were injured in the assault, simply ran straight at the gunman and took him down.\nYou know, as my wife and I told Officer Crystal Griner and her family last Thursday at the hospital, her extraordinary courage and the courage of Officer David Bailey saved lives and prevented an even greater tragedy. You know, we honor these heroes, but we also honor all those -- like those of you gathered here today -- at every level who stand in between us and the violence that besets our families and communities. Let's give these heroes a round of applause. (Applause.)\nYou know, we support them by speaking of their courage, but we also support them by standing with them and standing with all of you, each and every day. And make no mistake about it, President Donald Trump stands without apology with the men and women of law enforcement in America, and he always will. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump knows that to keep our streets and cities safe, our law enforcement officers need two things: resources and respect. And this President has taken decisive action to restore the tradition of respect and honor owed to law enforcement.\nSpeaking at the Peace Officers Memorial Service just last month, where we honored 234 heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty, President Trump denounced attacks on law enforcement, in his words, as \"a stain on the very fabric of our society.\" And he's working every day to bring it to an end.\nPresident Trump has directed the full force of the federal government to protect you, who protect us. And under the leadership of Attorney General Sessions and the Department of Justice, we're already taking every available action to ensure the safety and security of our law enforcement officers.\nIn the budget he sent to Congress just last month, the President called for more than $500 million to support federal law enforcement, including the hiring of more than 300 new attorneys and judges to tackle violent crime and support immigration enforcement.\nAnd President Trump also called for more than $5 billion in grant funding to support the men and women of law enforcement at the state, local, and tribal level. We will not rest until we ensure those of you who wear the uniform have the resources and the training to keep our families safe and go home safe to yours. (Applause.)\nAnd it's maybe more important now than ever before. The truth is, last year saw, actually, an increase in many of the worst types of violent crime. In our largest cities, crimes like robbery, rape, aggravated assault, and non-fatal shootings all rose in 2016 -- in some places by double digits. And the year before that, the murder rate saw its largest increase since 1968, and in many urban areas it continues to climb.\nStatistics don't tell the story, though. Those of you who wear the uniform, those of you who walk a beat, those of you who are victims' advocates know this: These aren't numbers. These are people. These are families. These are shattered lives.\nThe President said not long ago, this violence must end. And under this administration's leadership, and the President's determination, and through your courageous service, we will bring this violence to an end.\nPresident Trump has taken decisive action to restore law and order in our communities and keep our families and our children safe. It all, of course, starts with simply enforcing the law. President Trump has made it clear that it is the policy of this administration to enforce the laws of this country -- no exception, no apology. (Applause.)\nAt the President's direction, the Department of Justice will no longer let the worst offenders off easy. We're once again pursuing the most serious readily available, provable charges for drug traffickers and violent criminals. (Applause.)\nWith the courageous efforts of all of you gathered here, our administration is also getting the most dangerous criminals off of America's streets. A strike force in Denver recently took down one of the major drug trafficking groups in the western United States. A coordinated effort across five states caught more than 75 members of the Bloods, and a three-month campaign in San Diego took more than 140 gang members out of that community.\nAnd as President Trump has pointed out, MS-13 is being decimated and going directly to prison, including more than 40 members of that vicious cartel who were arrested in New York City just a few days ago. (Applause.)\nUnder this President, he's also made it clear that America's borders are now closed to illegal immigration, to illegal drug and illicit drugs, and anyone who dares to threaten the well-being of the people of this country. He's backed it up with action.\nIn the South Texas Corridor –- one of the main highways for illegal drugs -- federal agents have seized more than twice as much cocaine and nearly three times as much heroin compared to this time last year. Across the entire border, there have been at least 87 major drug seizures in just the past month and a half.\nAnd thanks to President Trump, and the efforts of law enforcement across the American Southwest, illegal crossings at America's southern border are down nearly 70 percent since January 1 of this year. (Applause.)\nNow the gains we've made because of your service and courage are encouraging. But the truth is, we still have a lot more to do to make this country safe again. And I can assure you, this administration is firmly committed to working with each and every one of you, to the agencies and departments that are represented here, to get the job done.\nPresident Trump has vowed, in his words now, \"to work with you, not against you\"; to \"support you, not undermine you.\" And I can assure you, serving with him every single day and knowing how he feels about the men and women of law enforcement, that's a promise you can count on every day, at every hour, under President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThe Attorney General, at the President's direction, has already ordered the Department of Justice to support state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners in your joint mission to reduce crime and ensure safety. He's also ordered the Department to review its agreements with your jurisdictions to promote local accountability and local control.\nBut these are only the first steps, not the last. We're just getting started. To confront the violence besetting our streets in too many American cities, we must continue to strengthen the partnership between every level of law enforcement, from the federal government down to the smallest cities and towns and townships, and also with the community and advocacy groups that care so deeply about our people's safety.\nThis very gathering is a testament to the President's dedication to build a strong relationship with all of you and with the communities represented here. Your input is vital as this taskforce continues to craft its recommendations, which the Attorney General will present to the President in the coming months. And we want to work closely with you as we implement those recommendations in the months and years ahead.\nWe want to listen to you, we want to learn from you, and we want to advance the security of the American people because of you.\nPresident Trump is supporting and standing with law enforcement at every level because he cares so deeply about the safety and security of the American people, and he knows we can make this country safe again.\nThis is about stopping drugs from entering our schools so that our children can shape their future. It's about kicking gang members out of our parks and alleyways so our families can live and play and walk the streets in peace. It's about protecting and respecting the courageous men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement to serve our communities and keep us safe.\nYou know, this is very humbling for me to stand before you today, and it's somewhat personal to my family. You know, I've never worn the uniform of law enforcement, but I grew up with an uncle who was a cop in Chicago. He was one of the heroes of my youth. And when we would travel from our small town in southern Indiana up to Chicago, one of the people we would be most excited to see was my uncle, in uniform, with his sidearm. And we would see that resolve as he'd walk out the door of my grandparents' home and go to work.\nWe were filled with pride and, frankly, in awe of my uncle and the courage that he showed every day, putting his life on the line for people he didn't even know, and then coming home as though it was just a job. Truly inspiring. It shaped my youth; it truly did.\nAnd I've always had that view of law enforcement officers ever since. You know, I'm mindful of a story in the Old Book that there was encounter that took place between a Centurion and a Nazorean. It's a great story, where a Centurion had approached the Nazorean in a little place called Capernaum. He had someone in household who was sick, and he asked for help. And as the Nazorean started to walk with him, he said, you don't need to come with me. He said, I'm a man under authority. He said, I tell one person to do this, they do it. Tell another to do this, he does it. He says, you only say the word, and that young one will be healed.\nAnd he said in that moment words that I thought I could relate to, as he stood and he looked at that peace officer with a sword at his side and said that Jesus was astonished.\nYou know, when I see people that put on a sidearm every morning, men and women who walk out -- give their families a kiss on the cheek and walk out to protect our families, I feel the same way. I'm just in awe. I'm in awe of people who answer a call of service in their life that puts the interest of others, the very lives of others, ahead of their own.\nWhen I was Governor of Indiana, I was never more humbled than when I stood at a swearing-in -- a ceremony. I was never more grieved than when I attended a funeral of one of those deputy sheriffs who had been sworn in at an occasion that I attended. The American people are deeply grateful for the service that all of you render.\nSo to all of you here today -- to the police officers, sheriffs, detectives, deputies, agents, prosecutors, and every other member of the law enforcement community -- just know that whatever happens in the public debate from time to time, when tragedy strikes and people sometimes assume the worst, that this President, this administration, and the people of this country know you are heroes all.\nYou have the appreciation of the American people. And I promise you, you have the gratitude and resolve of our President and our determination to give you the resources you need and the respect you deserve as you protect and serve.\nAnd you have our prayers. For all of you in this room, and all that you lead back home, and all the departments and all the agencies, may God protect you as you protect our families.\nWe've got a lot of work to do. But I say with confidence that with President Donald Trump in the White House, with the extraordinary service of the men and women of law enforcement in this country, and with God's grace, together we will make America safe again.\nThank you. God bless you. (Applause.) And God bless the United States of America.

The President also found that it was necessary to maintain certain restrictions with respect to North Korea that would otherwise have been lifted pursuant to Proclamation 8271 of June 26, 2008, which terminated the exercise of authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1-44) with respect to North Korea.\nOn August 30, 2010, the President signed Executive Order 13551, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the continued actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, manifested by its unprovoked attack that resulted in the sinking of the Republic of Korea Navy ship Cheonan and the deaths of 46 sailors in March 2010; its announced test of a nuclear device and its missile launches in 2009; its actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874, including the procurement of luxury goods; and its illicit and deceptive activities in international markets through which it obtains financial and other support, including money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods and currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking, which destabilize the Korean Peninsula and imperil United States Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners in the region.\nOn April 18, 2011, the President signed Executive Order 13570 to take additional steps to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 and expanded in Executive Order 13551 that would ensure the implementation of the import restrictions contained in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 and complement the import restrictions provided for in the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.).\nOn January 2, 2015, the President signed Executive Order 13687 to expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, expanded in Executive Order 13551, and addressed further in Executive Order 13570, to address the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during November and December 2014, actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718, 1874, 2087, and 2094, and commission of serious human rights abuses.\nOn March 15, 2016, the President signed Executive Order 13722 to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in subsequent Executive Orders, to address the Government of North Korea's continuing pursuit of its nuclear and missile programs, as evidenced by its February 7, 2016, launch using ballistic missile technology and its January 6, 2016, nuclear test in violation of its obligations pursuant to numerous United Nations Security Council resolutions and in contravention of its commitments under the September 19, 2005, Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, that increasingly imperils the United States and its allies.\nThe existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

Cohn.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126506", "text": "The President. Thank you very much. I just learned more about farming than I ever thought I'd learn. [Laughter] What a good place. I love it. I want to thank also Dean Scott Ermer along with the students and faculty at Kirkwood Community College for hosting us. What a beautiful place. We're here today to talk about how we're going to empower America's farmers and protect our Nation's proud farming legacy, including ethanol, which I've done. Family farmers are the backbone of America, and my administration will always support the farmer.\nI want to begin by congratulating Iowa's new Governor, Kim Reynolds. Where is Kim? I'm so proud of Kim. I've known Kim for a long time and her husband. And I said, you know, one of the other things I get with Terry , by moving him out, Kim becomes Governor—[laughter]—and Terry can take on China. That's not bad. She is doing a great job.\nThanks also to Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg and Iowa Secretary of Agriculture—a man who's been to so many of my stops—Bill Northey. Thank you, Bill. Thank you for all that support. And Congressman—a very popular guy—Rod Blum, doing a fantastic job in Washington.\nAll right, so, most importantly, I have to say—they will all agree—he's a great friend of mine, with an incredible family, a very talented son Eric—that I can tell you—but I'm really, truly proud. I wanted to be here for this reason—to congratulate your former Governor, our new Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad.\nTerry is a true legend. The people of Iowa first made him Governor in 1983. You elected him six times and made him the longest serving Governor of any State in the history of America. That's not bad.\nUnder Terry , Iowa's economy is stronger, its farmers more successful, its schools better, its communities more prosperous, and its citizens safer. And I want to tell you, that's three decades. This is one great man. He's been in politics for more than three decades. And we're going to keep him there—I don't know, do we consider Ambassadors politicians? Not really, in the true sense. So perhaps we sort pulled you out. But he's going to be a doing a job.\nI'll tell you one quick story with Terry. When I was campaigning in Iowa, Terry would always say: \"Do me favor. Don't say anything bad about China.\" [Laughter] See, in that day—in those days, he didn't call me \"Mr. President\"—he'd say \"Donald.\" He'd say, \"Donald, don't say anything bad about China.\" I said, why? He said, \"We have a great relationship with China, and I like it, and I really like President Xi,\" who he knew for 30-some-odd years.\nAnd I—it really dawned on me when I was thinking about Ambassadors. I said, boy, wouldn't it be great if I picked a man that really likes China and, by the way, China really likes him? So that was an easy one. I called him up, and I said, you know, I think after 24 years it's maybe time for a change, so let me just steal you. I also knew about Kim, and Kim has been a great supporter and friend, and so I knew that that was going to be taken care of very nicely. So we're really happy and really proud of Terry. You know, his legacy will endure for a long, long time in this State. He loves this State and the people so much. And together, we all join to express our deep gratitude to Terry for everything he has done for Iowa and for its people. Mr. Ambassador, thank you very much. And have a good time in China.\nU.S. Ambassador to China Terry E. Branstad. Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nFor a farm kid from Iowa, my life's ambition was to serve the people as Governor. I never imagined in my wildest dreams that President Trump would ask me to represent all of the United States of America in China. I will do my very best.\nMr. President, first of all, I want to congratulate you on your leadership. We've been trying to get American beef in China for 13 years, and you've already got it done. So—and there's more to come!\nI am honored and proud to represent the United States of America and President Trump in the People's Republic of China. And I hope a lot of you will come to see us.\nThank you.\nThe President. Thank you. Great guy. Ambassador Branstad will be serving in Beijing, but he's going to be fighting for American farmers and for American workers and for Americans. And there's nobody I can think of that can do a better job or a more effective job.\nSo, Terry, go out there. He'll be joining Secretary of Agriculture—somebody you all know very well—the legendary, Sonny Perdue—[laughter]—and a man who is another legend on Wall Street—truly a legend; they just call him Wilbur. How about Wall Street? Where Wall Street is big and strong, they—he's just known as Wilbur. It's Wilbur Ross. Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Commerce. Pretty good on Wall Street when they just say, \"I hear Wilbur is going to be Secretary of Commerce.\" Carl Icahn called me up. He said, \"Donald, I heard you got Wilbur.\" That was it. It wasn't \"Wilbur Ross.\" But there's Wilbur Ross, and he's going a fantastic job.\nAnd also working along with Wilbur is U.S. Trade Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, another phenomenal talent. And I told you about fair trade. I told you about free trade. I told you about trade. We have the best in the world on our sides now, finally, after watching for many, many decades what's been happening, with trade deficits that are beyond anything that anybody could imagine, hundreds of billions of dollars. And now we have the right people on our side.\nSo, Wilbur, go out and do it. Robert, go out and do it. We'll all have a good time together. And you know what? The world is going to like us even better, believe it or not.\nSo they're going to be representing—[applause]—they're going to be representing America's interests and delivering historic wins for our farmers and our factory workers and our workers generally.\nAnd I have to tell you, last night was very exciting. Karen Handel and Ralph—Ralph Norman. Ralph Norman. I spoke to Ralph today. He won a great event. Now, a lot of people didn't show up to vote because they said, well, he's going to win by so much. So it got a little bit tighter than he thought. [Laughter] Sometimes, when they think you're going to win by too much, I wouldn't say that's so good. Next time we're going to say it's going to be really close. But he still won easily. But what a fantastic guy he is. And between the two of them, that was a big night.\nSo we're five-and-oh in special elections, five-and-oh. [Applause] Five-and-oh. And I watched the faces on those newscasters, in many cases, and they were going, oh, this is going to be a big night; this will be great humiliation for President Trump if she doesn't make it. Well, they weren't thinking in terms of Ralph so much. In all fairness, Ralph, sort of, said he felt like the forgotten man last night.\nBut this will be tremendous humiliation—they built these studios; they built everything. They were set. Believe me, had our wonderful candidate lost, this would have been one of the great, big stories in the history of American politics. Those studios would have been up for weeks. They would have been talking for weeks about this tremendous defeat. And after it said projected winner, it was sort of—they just sort of slinked out of there. [Laughter] They slinked out.\nOne of them actually said, well, maybe it was the weather. You know, it was drizzling. A little bit like this, but a little bit less. It was drizzling. Did you hear that one, Ambassador? It was drizzling. Maybe that was the difference.\nAnd won by a lot. Won by a lot. So we're very happy. And she's going to be—Karen is going to be a great person in Congress. And we have some incredible people, and we're doing some really wonderful things, including the taxes are coming along, and the health care is coming along.\nAnd we have Gary Cohn, the President of Goldman Sachs, who left Goldman Sachs and a slightly higher salary than he's getting right now by, like, hundreds of millions of dollars, I don't know, by a lot. [Laughter] Where's Gary? He's around here someplace. And Gary is working on some incredible plans, not only taxes, but we're going to be rebuilding our country. We're going to do things in terms of infrastructure that we need. Our roads, our highways, our bridges, our schools, our airports.\nWe spent, as of a few months ago, $6 trillion—trillion—in the Middle East. We have nothing. We're back further than we were 16 years ago when this whole thing started—$6 trillion. And if you want to spend $3½ to build a school, or you want to build—you want to spend any money in this country, it's like a big deal. But we spent $6 trillion in the Middle East. And we're going to get that whole situation under control.\nThat's not an easy one. I was dealt a very difficult hand, believe me, when I took over, between North Korea, the Middle East—you look at Afghanistan, what's going on there. This was a tough hand. But you put me there for a reason, and I think you're going to be very happy with the end result, believe me.\nAmerican farmers and ranchers are the best, absolute best at what they do. And they can compete anywhere if they are given a level playing field. They're not given that level playing field because of our terrible, terrible trade deals. And we're going to start doing much better. You produce the product, but you have to work too hard and too long to make a living.\nWe're cracking down on foreign trading abuses, making it easier to produce and grow in America, eliminating job-killing regulations all over the place, and we're training our great American workers.\nThat's why it's so important to support schools like Kirkwood, which are helping to train young people in cutting-edge new technologies that will make American agriculture greater and more productive than ever before.\nFarming—which is something that is very beautiful to me. I'm not a farmer, but I'd be very happy to be one. It's a very beautiful world to me. And it's a truly noble American profession. Today we're celebrating the dignity of work and the greatness of the American farmer and the American worker. George Washington once wrote, \"I'd rather be on my farm than be emperor of the world.\" We understand that. Especially after I've spent all this time in Washington, I can really understand. [Laughter]\nI want to make sure the next generation of Americans has that opportunity as well. And in particular, that includes your children and your grandchildren and working very hard to get rid of the death tax so that those farms can be passed on. Very, very hard to get rid of that. We're working very hard so your farms can be passed on to your children and your grandchildren. And they'll keep them going, and they'll run them with love.\nWe want to eliminate the intrusive rules that undermine your ability to earn a living, and we will protect the corn-based ethanol and biofuels that power our country. And you remember, during the campaign, I made that promise. And I also made a promise, I'm coming back. And here I am. And that promise has been kept. And even Terry is clapping about that one. [Laughter] But he was fighting very hard for that, believe me.\nFor the past 2 weeks, my administration has been working extensively on vocational education, infrastructure, and technology. Here, at this great facility, we've just seen fantastic examples of how vocational training in new technologies can help make American farming even more productive so we can compete and win, win, win on the world stage.\nWe saw how today's farmers can adjust application rates of fertilizers in their fields with just the touch of a smartphone. It's changed a lot over the years. They showed us how they use precision agriculture to produce crops more efficiently and for far less cost. They've demonstrated how drones, of all things, are used to gather data on crops, and how simulators are used to train students in the next generation of farming equipment. If we continue to train our workers in these new technologies, then we will usher in a new era of prosperity for American agriculture and for the American farming family.\nWe must also ensure that these students have the broadband Internet access they need in order to succeed and thrive in this new and very modern and very changed economy and world. That is why I will be including a provision in our infrastructure proposal—$1 trillion proposal, you'll be seeing it very shortly—to promote and foster enhanced broadband access for rural America also. We know that Wall Street wants it very badly, but you know what else? The farmers also want it. And you're going to have it.\nWe have to make sure American farmers and their families, wherever they may be, wherever they may go, have the infrastructure projects that they need to compete and grow. And I mean grow against world competition, because that's who you're up against now.\nWe will rebuild rural America. American farmers—[applause]—thank you—American farmers pour their hearts into their crops and their love into their great communities. That's why they call this the heartland. And those maps, those electoral maps, they were all red. Beautiful red. [Laughter] Beautiful. You look at those maps, it's almost, like, wow. A lot places that people weren't thinking about turned red. A couple of little blue dots on the sides, but they are red—farmers.\nAnd our farmers' work ethic feeds America, and their toughness and grit define America. They're tough, and they're smart. Our rich and abundant soil provides more than a living; it provides a beautiful way of life for a lot of people. Today we honor and treasure this noble history, and embrace the new technology that will power this industry well into the future. With incredible leaders and students like all of you, I know that the future of American farming has never looked brighter, believe me. And with me as your President, it's going to be that way, I will tell you that.\nSo it's a great honor to be here with you today. People that I know, people that I love, very special people; the people of Iowa that were so good to me during the election. So many friends. I want to thank you for being here.\nGod bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-06-21", "title": "Remarks in Cedar Rapids, Iowa"}

U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. Thank you, everybody. It is great to be back in the incredible, beautiful, great State of Iowa, home of the greatest wrestlers in the world, including our friend, Dan Gable. Some of the great, great wrestlers of the world, right? We love those wrestlers.\nIt's always terrific to be able to leave that Washington swamp and spend time with the truly hard-working people. We call them American patriots, amazing people.\nI want to also extend our congratulations this evening to Karen Handel of Georgia. And we can't forget Ralph Norman in South Carolina. He called me, and I called him. He said, you know, last night I felt like the forgotten man. But he won, and he won really beautifully, even though most people—a lot of people didn't show up because they thought he was going to win by so much. It's always dangerous to have those big leads. But he won very easily, and he is a terrific guy.\nAnd I'll tell you what, Karen is going to be really incredible. She is going to be joining some wonderful people and doing some wonderful work, including major, major tax cuts and health care and lots of things. Going to be reducing crime, and we're securing that Second Amendment. I told you about that. And that looks like it's in good shape with Judge Gorsuch. That looks like it's in good shape.\nI'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend, somebody that I've gotten to know very well, Steve Scalise, and everyone recovering from the assault.\n[At this point, demonstrators began blowing whistles.]\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Never fails—[laughter]—never fails.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nAudience members. Boo!\nAudience member. We love you, President Trump!\nThe President. Thank you.\nAudience member. We've got your back, President Trump.\nThe President. Thank you. And we love our police. We love our police.\nSo to Steve, we say—and he's a great guy. He was in my office the day before—incredible. We're praying for you. We're pulling for you. You have our absolute support and our deepest admiration.\nAnd our gratitude goes out tonight as well to the Capitol Police officers who saved so many lives. You know, they ran from the outfield in. They were being hit by rifle fire. They only had handguns, and they were able to get him. It was an amazing show of talent and bravery. So we want to thank all of the police officers who so bravely serve and protect us. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nHopefully, our Nation emerges from this ordeal—it was an ordeal, terrible—more unified and more determined than ever before. And I can see it and we are indeed more unified in our own way than ever before. You just have to take a look at what's happening here. Right?\nIf we set aside the cynics and the critics, we have a chance—and it's a great chance—it lies before us to do extraordinary things for our country in the years ahead. History is written by the dreamers, not the doubters. So while we are here tonight to celebrate the amazing progress that we've already made—and we have made amazing progress—we are also here to lay out the next steps in our incredible movement to make America great again.\nAudience members. ——great again.\nThe President. Everyone gathered in this arena is bound together by common values. You love our country, you obey our laws, you honor our traditions, and you care for your families, and you love your communities. All you want is a government that shows you the same respect and loyalty in return. You believe that America must protect and defend its own citizens.\nWith that conviction deep in your hearts, you showed up on election day, November 8, and voted to put America first. About time. It's about time. And from the moment I took that solemn oath of office—and every single day since—that is exactly what I've done: put America first.\nAfter years of sending our jobs and our wealth to other countries, we are finally standing up for our country. And you see it happening. You see it happening. You see what's going on. Jobs are just about the best they've ever been. We've created almost $4 trillion in wealth. If you look at your stock values, and you look at what's going on with our country. But we've created tremendous wealth. The enthusiasm and spirit on every single index is higher than it's ever been before for our manufacturers and for our companies.\nAfter spending billions of dollars defending other people's borders, we are finally going to defend our borders.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nAudience members. Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!\nThe President. After decades of rebuilding foreign nations all over the world, we are now rebuilding our Nation. As of a few months ago, our country had spent $6 trillion in the Middle East—wasted. And the lives—the lives, thousands and thousands and thousands of lives—$6 trillion and thousands of young, beautiful lives. We started 16 years ago, and it's in far worse shape than it was 16 years ago, by many times over. So we spent all of this money, all of these lives, and let me tell you, I came in and took over a very, very difficult hand. But we're going to get it fixed. That's what you put me here for. We're going to get it fixed. [Applause] We'll get it fixed.\nIt's a shame. It's a shame. And then, you look at North Korea——\nAudience member. We're praying for you.\nThe President. Thank you.\nAudience member. We're praying for you. The President. Then, you look at your—[laughter].We're praying. And I'm praying for you. That's true. [Laughter] Thank you very much.\nBut you look at North Korea, what's going—look at Otto—beautiful Otto. Went over there a healthy, wonderful boy, and you see how he came back. You see how he came back.\nSo we've been given a bad hand. But we're going to take that bad hand, and it'll all be good. In addition to that, we're going to start taking care of our country. The people are the rulers of this country once again. One by one, we are keeping the promises we made to the people of Iowa and the people all over our country. We are not going to let the same failed and tired voices in Washington keep us from delivering the change you voted for and the change that you deserve. That you deserve.\nI do not answer to any donors or financial contributors. I don't care about them. I am not beholden to any consultants or any of the very powerful special interests. I don't care about them. I have to do what's right. And if they're right, that's good. And we will never be intimidated by the dishonest media corporations who will say anything and do anything to get people to watch their screens or to get people to buy their failing papers.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. They are failing.\nThese entrenched forces are fighting only for themselves and, in many cases, for their survival. But I'm fighting for you. I'm fighting for you. Fighting for your hopes, because your hopes are my hopes. I've had a great time in this country. I've had a great run.\nAnd it was time to do something. We all saw what was happening. It was time to do something. Your dreams are my dreams, and your future is what I'm focused on each and every day. We're going to make America great again, believe me. We're going to make America great again.\nHere are just some of the historic accomplishments we've achieved in just a very short period of time. And I have to just preface it by saying——\nAudience members. We love you!\nThe President. Thank you, darling. [Laughter]\nI have to preface it by saying—you know, I've been watching—they're saying, \"President Trump has not produced health care.\" You know, I've been there for 5 months. [Laughter] If you remember, during the Clinton period, they worked for years and year and years, and they never got health care. Obama——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Although after listening to that testimony, I fully understand. [Laughter]\nBut President Obama, his whole administration pushing, pushing for Obamacare, which is now failed. In fact, I was just told by your great Governor and ex-Governor that your insurance companies have all fled the State of Iowa. Pretty sad, isn't it? Well, they're fleeing—I tell you what, they're going from every State. They're leaving all of the States. Obamacare is a disaster. It's over. And I there's nothing to compare what we're doing. I think, I hope—I hope—the Republican Senate—if we went and got the single greatest health care plan in the history of the world, we would not get one Democrat vote, because they're obstructionists. They're obstructionists. We wouldn't get one Democrat. If we came to you and said, \"Here's your plan: You're going to have the greatest plan in history, and you're going pay nothing,\" they'd vote against it, folks. [Laughter] Every single vote.\nSo we have a very slim 52 to 48. That means we basically can't lose anybody. And I think—and I hope—I can't guarantee anything—but I hope we're going to surprise you with a really good plan. You know, I've been talking about a plan with heart—I said, add some money to it—a plan with heart. But Obamacare is dead. But it is interesting how they say, \"Donald Trump is not producing health care, not producing.\" So we've produced so much—I don't think any President—it could be somebody; I have to be a little careful, because they'll say, \"He lied.\" [Laughter] So, few Presidents—few—just have to be a little careful, because they'll say, \"Headline: Donald Trump Lies to the People of Iowa.\" [Laughter] I don't want—[laughter].\nBut very few have done what we've done when you look at the regulations, when you look at all of—you know, they were saying, \"But he didn't pass legislative bills.\" I think it's 38. And we're going to be talking about that—38. And they—if you listen to them—38. But, but, but—and some of them are really big, having to do with regulation, having to do with lots of different things. But we're working really hard on massive tax cuts.\nIt would be, if we get it the way I want it, the largest tax cut in the history of the United States of America. Because right now we are one of the highest taxed nations in the world. Really, on a large-scale basis, we are the highest taxed Nation in the world. And we're going to get it down really low, okay? I don't say the lowest, because there are couple that are really down there—[laughter]—but that doesn't mean you want to be there. [Laughter] But we're going to have one of the lowest taxes from the highest tax, and we're working hard on it. And I think it's going to happen. And I'll tell you, I think health care is going to happen, and infrastructure is going to happen. You're going to have a lot of exciting things over the next few months. And I look forward to being able to produce it. Let's see what happens.\nAnd by the way, if we had even a little Democrat support—just a little, like a couple of votes—you'd have everything. And you could give us a lot of votes, and we'd even be willing to change it and move it around and try and make it even better. It's going to have good heart, but even better. But again, they just want to stop; they just want to obstruct. A few votes——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Seriously. A few votes from the Democrats, it could be so easy and so beautiful, and you'd have cooperation. And their plan isn't working, because they thought they were going to win last night in Atlanta. They thought they were going to win. And they've been unbelievably nasty, really nasty. And they thought—they spent close to $30 million on this kid, who forgot to live in the community that he was in. I mean, you know. [Laughter]\nLook, I'll tell you about the Democrats. I am making it a little bit hard to get their support, but who cares. [Laughter] But I'll tell you about the Democrats. They raised a fortune for them. They fought like hell. They said they were going to win. All of the television networks, other than Fox—which really has treated us fairly, by the way—they have. But they've built these studios—CNN.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Oops! Hey, their camera just went off. [Laughter] I can't imagine. [Laughter] It's covered live. Their camera just went off. I can't imagine why. [Laughter] This phony NBC television network—— Audience members. Boo!\nThe President. They actually had one of the people say, you know, it was a little rainy last night, and maybe that was the difference in Karen's race. [Laughter] Can you believe that?\nBut they had these beautiful studios. And if Karen Handel had lost, they would have blamed it on me, which is fine. But if she had lost, they would have been there for weeks talking about this. This would have been the greatest defeat in the history of American politics.\nWhen she won, when they said, \"Projected winner is Karen Handel,\" then they said, \"We switch to another program.\" Right? [Laughter] So—it was so short. They couldn't get out of there fast enough. [Laughter] And don't forget, this happened in Montana. Right? In Kansas. Last night, South Carolina, with Ralph—who was expected to win, and he won. California.\nSo—but it's been incredible. So we're five-and-oh. We're five-and-oh. And they thought they were going to win at least, like, three, right? Wouldn't you say? At least three. And it would be a devastating defeat. The truth is, people love us, all of us. They love us. They don't get it. They haven't figured it out yet. You know, they're still trying to figure where all of those voters came from. Those voters came out of the hills, they came—these are hard-working—we have the hardest working, the smartest people, the toughest people. They're very lucky that our people don't protest, believe me. Believe me. They've very lucky. [Applause]\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. See? We have them. We have the smart ones. We have the toughest ones. Great, great Americans. And Hillary said the \"deplorables.\" These are just the opposite, believe me, of the deplorables. These are just the opposite.\nWe have a group, Bikers for Trump. You ever see them? They come by the thousands—oh. Oh! My man, look—how are you? Chris. We have the—I didn't know you were here. They're here. Now we know we're protected. That's great. Good to have you, man. These are great people. And when I see them, I say, now we're safe. [Laughter] And they like Trump, and I guess we're well into the nineties. What do you think? The nineties—ninety-fives.\nBut we love our people, and they love us. And more importantly, they love our policy; they love what we're doing. You see what we're doing, you see what we've already done. Homebuilders are starting to build again. We're not confiscating their land with ridiculous rules and regulations that don't make sense. Farmers are able to plow their fields. If they have a puddle in the middle of their field—a little puddle the size of this—it's considered a lake, and you can't touch it. [Laughter] And if you touch it, bad, bad things happen to you and your family. We got rid of that one too, okay?\nUnemployment is at a 16-year low, and manufacturing is doing phenomenally. And we have companies moving back. They're coming back, back, back. You know, in the State of Michigan, which has just been like an exit pool, where car companies have left, I told them, you know what, you want to start leaving? You want to fire all these people? You watch what we're going to be doing. You watch what we're going to be doing. Not going to be too long.\nWe have the legendary Wall Street genius, Wilbur Ross, here. He's our Secretary of Commerce. We have Gary Cohn, who was the president of Goldman Sachs. In fact, somebody—he's the president of Goldman Sachs. He had to pay over $200 million in taxes to take the job, right? [Laughter] So somebody said, why did you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy? [Laughter] I said—no it's true. And Wilbur is a very rich person in charge of Commerce. I said, because that's the kind of thinking we want. I mean, you know, really, because they're representing the country. They don't want the money. They're representing the country. And they had to give up a lot to take these jobs. They gave up a lot. When you get the president—this is the president of Goldman Sachs—smart. Having him represent us—he went from massive paydays to peanuts, to little tiny—[laughter]—I'm waiting for them to accuse him of wanting that little amount of money. They wanted that. [Laughter]\nBut these are people that are great, brilliant business minds, and that's what we need. That's what we have to have so the world doesn't take advantages of us. We can't have the world taking advantage of us anymore.\nAnd I love all people, rich or poor. But in those particular positions, I just don't want a poor person. Does that make sense? Does that make sense? If you insist, I'll do it. But I like it better this way, right?\nSo we've achieved a historic increase in defense spending, and we've created a new Office of Accountability at the VA—our veterans—to ensure our veterans get the care that they so richly deserve—our veterans.\nWe've eliminated restrictions on the production of American energy. They wanted to take away our wealth. The world wanted to take away our wealth. We happen to be lucky; under our feet, we have great wealth. Not only in the form of your kind of wealth, which is beautiful, fertile soil, but also in other locations in the form of energy. They wanted to take that power and that wealth away from us.\nAnd we've ended the war on clean, beautiful coal, and we're putting our miners back to work. In fact—you read about it—last week, a brandnew coal mine just opened in the State of Pennsylvania, first time in decades—decades. We've reversed it. And 33,000 mining jobs have been added since my Inauguration. And again, we're going to have all forms of energy. But coal is something we have a tremendous advantage of. But we're going to have all—whether it's natural gas, whether it's alternative sources—we're going to have everything.\nBut a power is coal. It's a power for our electric—different plants and for our furnaces. It's a power. We use electric. We use wind. We use solar. We use coal. We use natural gas. We will use nuclear if the right opportunity presents itself. We're going to be strong for the future. We're going to be strong for the future. I don't want to just hope the wind blows—[laughter]—to light up your homes and your factories——\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. ——as the birds fall to the ground. [Laughter]\nBut I like all of them. And that's what we need. And by the way, we are saving your ethanol industries in the State of Iowa, just like I promised I would do in my campaign. And believe me, they are under siege, folks. I don't know if you know it. But they are under siege.\nWe've approved—first day—the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline. First day. Day one. Thirty-eight thousand jobs.\nAudience member. Drill, baby, drill!\nThe President. And better for the environment, by the way. Better—underground—better for the environment and safer. Can you imagine the executive for Keystone who, a year and half ago, was told it's dead? And they had billions invested. They'd bought half of the pipe. And somebody walks into his office, probably a consultant that charged him tens of millions of dollars: \"Sir, the pipeline was just approved.\" And you know what he's going to do. He said: \"I did a great job. I'm entitled to millions of dollars in consulting fees.\" It was just Trump approving the pipeline. We approved it. We approved it. It's good for the country. Right? My man.\nAnd by the way, speaking of that, when I'm signing for the XL Pipeline and the Dakota, I said, by the way, who made the pipe? You don't want to know.\nAudience member. U.S.A.!\nThe President. No, not the U.S.A., believe me. [Laughter] I said, who made the pipe? Now in all fairness to them, they bought a lot of their pipe already, so it's a little hard to say throw that away, we're giving you—you know. But I put a little clause—handwritten. It said, anybody builds a pipeline in the United States will use American steel and fabricate in America. No more taking it over on boats. Very simple.\nWe've signed 39 pieces of legislation. That means going through Congress, folks. Because you know, they tell you—these guys, the fake news—they tell you——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. It's fake news. It's fake. Not all of it. Some of it's good. And some of the people are great, actually, but some are real bad, and they're really fake. But if you listen to them, we didn't pass any—we passed 39—I'm not talking about Executive orders, which we've signed a lot. I mean, we have really signed a lot. And we've gotten rid of a lot of really bad pieces that were signed by President Obama, believe me.\nBut if you listen to the fake news, they say, like, he didn't pass any legislation. Everything is Executive—that's wrong. Thirty-nine pieces as of today, some of them very important.\nNow, my biggest pieces are yet to come: hopefully, taxes; hopefully, health care; hopefully, infrastructure. And when they come——\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. That won't be good enough. [Laughter] See, you watch. But we've also done a record number of resolutions to eliminate the job-killing regulations on our workers, our companies, and our farmers. They're gone. They're gone.\nWe are ending the Federal intrusion into your family farms and your ranches. And we're also working very, very hard to get rid of the death tax so that you can pass your farms onto your children and onto your grandchildren. I don't know if we're going to pull that one off, but we're working very hard to do it. Right, Chris? This way, you can pass your motorcycle on, okay? Forget about the farm, right? [Laughter] That's not so bad either. I've seen what you ride. Not so bad.\nBut we're working on—I don't know if that one is going to get pulled off, but it should. Because you should have a right. Why should you be double-taxed? You should have a right to pass your farm on to your children and on to your grandchildren—you should have that right—without having them going out and borrowing a fortune, not being able to make payments, losing it to the banks. It's not fair. So we're working hard. Let's see if we pull it off. We're going to try very hard, I can tell you. I don't know, but we're going to try.\nNo longer will the EPA be telling you how to run your business or do your job or live your life. Instead, it will focus on its true mission: clean air and clean, beautiful, crystal water—nice, beautiful, clean water. That's what we want, right? Right? We are also ending the last administration's Federal land grab. We believe States, communities, and private landowners know best how to manage their own resources. We've made a lot of progress in that—Ryan Zinke.\nWe want to see local control. That also means we are not going to let foreign bureaucrats plan our economy or tell Americans how to run their country. You know what I mean.\nWhen I campaigned for President, I promised to renegotiate or to leave any deal which fails to serve America's interests. And I'm not going to allow other countries to take advantage of the United States any longer. And for that reason, I totally cut off negotiations. I will not do our great—what is it? P—go ahead. P—do you know what it is? Huh? PPP. Yes? You guys weren't listening then, huh? [Laughter]\nBut for that reason, and that too—as you know, I've formally announced that the United States will withdraw from the disastrous Paris climate accord. It's a disaster. [Applause] It's a disaster.\nAnd by the way, Trans-Pacific Partnership—we don't even talk about it anymore because that was done early. But Trans-Pacific Partnership, bye-bye. [Laughter] That was another NAFTA catastrophe that we're going to, by the way, renegotiate. You know, I announced I'm going to get rid of NAFTA. And I've always told you, I'll either renegotiate or terminate NAFTA. So I announced that essentially I was going to terminate, but I got a very, very nice call from Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, from the President—a good guy—of Mexico asking me not to terminate it. Could we negotiate? And I'm always willing to negotiate. I'm always willing. So we'll see. We'll see how it works out.\nBut it's been very unfair to the United States. Now, all you have to do is look at all the empty buildings and all the empty plants and factories all over the country. NAFTA has been a disaster, so we're going to either renegotiate it successfully, which would be my first choice, or we're going to terminate it, and that's going to be that.\nNow, the Paris Agreement—and it's amazing how the people of this country get it, because the press covers it so unfairly—the Paris Agreement would have cost America millions of lost jobs and billions and billions of lost dollars and put us at a permanent economic disadvantage. China doesn't kick in until 2030. [Laughter] I could tell you stories. I could give you stats. I could go on all day. It's a catastrophe if we would have agreed. And they all say it's nonbinding. Like hell it's nonbinding. When we get sued by everybody because we thought it was nonbinding, then you can tell me it was nonbinding.\nI was elected to serve the citizens of Iowa and Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan and Wisconsin and Florida and all 50 States and all 320 million American citizens.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. By the way, this is a big place. This place is——\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. And you know, I used to say it during the campaign; I'm sure it hasn't changed. But we're not even campaigning, and look at this crowd. So you know, it's easier during the campaign. The place is packed with thousands of people trying to get in. Look at the size of this place. They'll never show the crowd.\nAudience members. Boo! The President. They'll never show the crowd. They'll never show the crowd. That's the only good thing about the protestors—which we don't have very much of. I mean, this guy was blowing a whistle, you know. [Laughter] He's a Bernie Sanders guy. [Laughter] But—but—we don't have many—but when we do have one, the only good thing is, the cameras have to go, and they have to go sometimes up into—[inaudible]—that's the corners. Way up in that arena. Every seat is packed. Look at that. Every seat. Every corner is packed of this big, big arena. So it's an honor.\nWouldn't it be great if they showed—you know, it's funny. I'd go home and my wife would say—Melania, who, by the way, has become very popular. They're liking her. [Applause] They're liking her. But she'd say, I never saw the crowd, but it sounded like a lot of people. You know, you could tell. [Laughter] You can't imitate the sound of this many people. This is not like 500 people, 1,000—this is big stuff. You can't imitate that.\nYou know what they don't understand? They get these massive ratings. I hate to give it. They probably charge a fortune. I know they charge a fortune. But all those television cameras, all those live ones—and I hate to do this—but they'd get even better ratings if they'd show that. And I try and convince them. But that, they can't do. They just can't mentally handle that one. So it's, whatever. But it is—it's such a great crowd. To all of those people watching, it's an unbelievable place. It is a big, beautiful arena, and it is packed.\nSo as you may know, there is another absolutely terrible deal from the previous administration. See how nice I am? [Laughter]I say the previous administration, as opposed to the Obama administration.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. That I have recently rescinded. Last week, I announced that we are canceling the prior administration's completely one-sided deal with the Castro regime in Cuba.\nIsn't it amazing? Obama can deal with Cuba—kills thousands of people, people in prison, horrible to women, horrible to every—can deal with Iran. You talk about bad. The gays, the women, the—bad to everybody. Killed. Brutal. I deal with anybody, it's like, \"Donald Trump is a terrible human being.\" It's unbelievable, isn't it? Isn't it unbelievable? It's unbelievable.\nBut America will stand strong against Communist oppression. We will make a much better deal. I mean, the fact is, the deal with Cuba is a bad deal. We'll probably make a deal, and maybe we won't. Maybe we won't. But you know what, if we make a deal it's going to be a fair deal and a good deal for us. It's not going to be a one-sided giveaway.\nWe're also fighting every single day to achieve those fair trade deals for Americans' factories and your farmers and your ranchers. Heading up our effort to represent America's interest in China will be a man you know very well. I just left an event where I honored him, introduced him to a crowd of people that adore him, to discuss how to create—I mean, he's been doing this for years in Iowa—he's the longest serving Governor in American history, and now he carries the title of Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad.\nHe's a fantastic guy. You know, I told the story today. I said, I'd come here to make a speech, we'd have a big crowd in Iowa. And Terry would come and say—at that time, he didn't call me \"Mr. President,\" he called me \"Donald.\" [Laughter] I said, that's okay—I didn't think about it. Now, if he called me \"Donald,\" I'd be very angry with him, right? [Laughter] Kidding. But he said: \"Donald, could you do me a favor? Don't say anything bad about China. We do a lot of business with China. I like China a lot. I've known President Xi for a long time. I really like him.\" And he also, by the way, likes Terry a lot. \"And just please don't say anything bad about China\"—which is hard for me to do. [Laughter] And I wouldn't.\nBut then when I won, and we're looking for somebody to represent us with China—which is a very, very powerful country, and we've had a very good relationship with China, in all fairness. And I do like President Xi. I wish we would have a little more help with respect to North Korea from China, but that doesn't seem to be working out. But I do like the President a lot. So when I was thinking of who am I going to make the Ambassador to China, after having a good retentive mind—[laughter]—I said, you know, I remember about a year ago when Terry Branstad was saying all of these great things—your Governor. So I called him up. I said, listen, you've been doing this for 24 years. You want to do something else? Like, how would you like to be Ambassador to China? And I didn't think he'd really do it. [Laughter] It's a long trip. [Laughter] Twenty-one hours. That's a lot of plane time. But he wants to do what's right for the country.\nAnd I said to him tonight, I said, I wasn't sure you were going to do it. He said, when my President calls me to help him with our great country, I do it. That's what he said to me. I thought it was nice. [Applause] Thought it was nice. Right?\nSo central to that economic agenda is a plan to restore America's crumbling infrastructure. We will rebuild not only America, but we will rebuild rural America. In this great national rebuilding, we will follow two simple rules: We will buy American, and we will hire American.\nWe want to get our people off of welfare and back to work. We also want to preserve our safety net for struggling Americans who truly need help. We want to help them. People that truly need help. Right, Chris? We want to help those people.\nBut others don't treat us fairly. That's why I believe the time has come for new immigration rules, which say that those seeking admission into our country must be able to support themselves financially and should not use welfare for a period of at least 5 years. And we'll be putting in legislation to that effect very shortly.\nAnother core principle is that those coming to our country must embrace our values and love our people. And yes, we will build the wall. We've already started planning. It will be built.\nAudience members. Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!\nThe President. We will build the wall. We need it. We need it. We have to stop the drugs from flowing in. You know, people don't realize we're already spending a lot of money on design. But I'll give you an idea that nobody has heard about yet. And I'm not sure, but I'm a builder—that's what I love to do. That's probably what I do best. I'm a builder. And we're thinking of something that's unique. We're talking about the southern border. Lots of sun, lots of heat. We're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall so it creates energy and pays for itself. And this way, Mexico will have to pay much less money. And that's good, right? [Laughter] Is that good?\nYou're the first group I've told that to. A solar wall. Makes sense. Let's see. We're working it out. We'll see. Solar wall—panels. Beautiful. I mean, actually, think of it, the higher it goes, the more valuable it is. It's like—[laughter]. Pretty good imagination, right? Good? My idea. So we have a good shot. That's one of the places that solar really does work. The tremendous sun and heat. It really does work there. So we'll see what happens with that. That would be great. And I think we could make it look beautiful too. It would really look beautiful. So that would be nice. We're also working night and day to restore law and order to our country. Law and order. You know that. We're reversing the last administration's soft-on-crime policies that helped enable a tragic rise in violent crime. You see what's happening. Look at Chicago. What the hell is going on in Chicago? [Laughter] What's that all about?\nWe have also issued new directives to protect our police officers and our sheriffs. And we'll always stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. All American children, no matter where they live, have the right to grow up in a safe community. No issue is more central to public safety than the issue of immigration and border security. After years of lawlessness, the United States is now enforcing our laws—first time in a long time—and protecting our workers, our schools, and our families.\nSince I was elected, illegal border crossings—and this is without the wall, before the wall—have decreased by more than 75 percent, a historic and unprecedented achievement. So we're building the wall on the southern border. We've got the greatest security people in the world, I'll tell you. ICE and the Border Patrol folks, these are incredible people. You know, they endorsed me when I ran for President, knowing that if I win, they're going to have to work much, much harder. [Laughter] But they love this country, and they want the job done, and they want the job done right. They have to work harder, and it's much more dangerous.\nThe other thing that I have to tell you: You have a gang called MS-13——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. A friend of mine who's a very, very high-level police officer said to me, in describing them, they are the equivalent or worse than Al Qaida. I would say that's a bad statement. They don't like to shoot people; they like to cut people. They do things that nobody can believe. These are true animals. We are moving them out of the country by the thousands—by the thousands. And the people moving them are—guess what?—a hell of a lot tougher and meaner than they are. But they're on our side. We're getting them out, MS-13.\nDuring my campaign for President, I met with the families of Americans killed by illegal immigrants—many, many families—including the parents of Sarah Root, a 21-year-old Iowa girl who was killed the day after she graduated from college with a 4.0 GPA. You know what that is? To those of you that don't know, that means solid A's, straight across, number-one student. Thousands of beautiful American lives like Sarah's have been stolen for the simple reason that our Government has refused to enforce already-existing laws.\nThe media—these people—like to talk about separating families. But the families they never talk about are the American families separated forever from the ones they love because we don't protect our borders and uphold the immigration laws of the United States.\nThese families and the victims had been ignored totally by the media. They were ignored by the consultants. They've been ignored by Washington. But these Americans were not ignored by me or by you, and we know who they are. And they rise now to the highest level. They rise to the highest level. I promised those families the deaths of their loved ones will not have been in vain and that we will take strong and forceful action to fulfill our sacred duty to save and protect American lives.\nEvery single day, we are finding these gang members, these drug dealers, thieves, robbers, predators, criminals, killers—horrible killers—and we are throwing them the hell out of our country. And when they're gone, our now very strong borders, especially with the wall, will never allow them back in. So we're doing a lot of things. We're very proud of what we've done. Justice Gorsuch was a big, big deal. Big deal. Somebody explained it to me beautifully. They said, when you pick a Supreme Court judge, you want great intellect, you want all of the things. But you also want youth because they'll be there for 40 years.\nSo if Judge Gorsuch—who I've gotten to know, who I think is a fantastic human being, aside from being a brilliant, brilliant student and person, and one of the great legal writers that exists in our country, probably in the world today—every time you see a decision written over the next 30 or 40 years, and especially if it's a 5-to-4 decision, like perhaps on Second Amendment or so many other things, you have done something that you can't value. It's so important.\nThink of it: For a 30- to 40-year period, potentially, you've influenced this country. And I've always heard—long—that just about the most important thing you can do—I always say defense. But perhaps outside—because we are going to have a strong military and strong defense, and we need it now.\nBut I've always heard that the most important thing a President can do is pick a great Supreme Court Justice. So I've got one, probably have some more. But it is really important. And think of that: Over years and years, those decisions that are so important—values, great values. So I'm very, very proud of that pick. He's already been there now for almost 2 months, and people are saying, wow, that is a tremendous person and a tremendous intellect. So we're all very proud of that pick, and you made it possible.\nSo I began this campaign on June 16—a couple of days ago, 2 years. It's my birthday on June 14, Flag Day of all things. [Applause]\nAudience members. Happy birthday!\nThe President. And we came down the escalator—that famous escalator ride, Melania, myself—and the place went nuts, hopefully, because they like me, but I think also they like the policies. I said the truth. I talked about immigration. I talked about what was happening on the borders. I talked about our military. I talked about the drug problems, which are tremendous—even in Iowa—tremendous problems beyond anything we've ever seen before.\nI talked about all of it. And you know what? We were never off center stage in the debates. We stayed—you know what that means. We were number one all the way through—all the way through. We were number one all the way through because of people like you. Never off center. Seventeen people running. I kept looking up and down. I said, boy, that's a lot of people. [Laughter] Some of them very talented.\nBut 17 people running. We were never off center stage in those debates. And that's because of people like yourselves. Because you agree with me. And we are making such incredible progress. We are making progress like nobody can believe. These people are being driven crazy—crazy. [Laughter]\nI mean, they have phony witch hunts going against me. They have everything going. And you know what, all we do is win, win, win. We won last night. They can't believe it. They're saying, what is going on? What is going on? We won last night. And even the worst of them said, that was a big win for Trump. I couldn't believe it actually. Thank you very much, folks. I appreciate it. [Laughter]\nBut we have made a journey together like no other, ever, in the history of this country and maybe beyond that. But you look in the history of this country; there's never been anything like this that's happened. We're straightening out, through common sense and through a good heart, we straightening out our country. We're straightening out our country.\nNo matter our beliefs, no matter our party, it's time for us to remember that we are all Americans and that we are in this together. And it would be great if the Republicans and the Democrats could come together and get really, really great legislation passed.\nSome of the geniuses were saying this morning, you know, from the time he announced on June 16, 2 years ago, they've been hitting the hell out of him. Hillary took almost all negative ads. The problem was, when people went to vote, they didn't know what she stood for other than, she was saying bad things about me. And I almost became, like——\nAudience members. Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\nThe President. Jeez! Think of it. So from the time I announced, I've been hit, hit, hit. Then, from the time I got in, I said, oh, this is going to great. Finally, we're going to all come together. They hit me harder, harder, harder. They've now learned, I think, that that doesn't work. Five-and-oh, five-and-oh. Okay? It doesn't work.\nThey need to be positive. They can't continue to be obstructionists. That's all they have going. So they should come together. I don't think they will. But I will tell you, it would be a beautiful, beautiful thing if we could get together as two parties that love our country and come up with that great health care and come up with that great tax deal for our people and tax reform and infrastructure and so many other things.\nJust think about what a unified American nation could achieve. Nobody could even come close to us. And by the way, even if we're not totally unified, nobody is coming close to us either. You—so don't worry about it.\nGleaming new roads and bridges that inspire awe and wonder all over the world. You know, we used to be the leader in airports. We'd have the most beautiful airports. Now we're like a third-world country. LaGuardia, Newark, LAX, Kennedy, they're like third-world airports. Take a look. Take a look.\nWe used to be the leader. Now you go to Saudi Arabia, where I just came back. A monumental, epic trip, because I said you cannot continue to fund terrorism. You cannot continue to fund terrorism. And the King of Saudi Arabia, who has really become just—he's a very special man. I mean that. He has taken it to heart. And now they're fighting with other countries that have been funding terrorism. And I think we had a huge impact. We will see. But I think we had a tremendous impact.\nWe cannot let these incredibly rich nations fund radical Islamic terror or terrorism of any kind. We cannot let it happen. Cannot let it happen. It was one of the great 2 days of my life. And I'm sure a lot of you watched it on television: 54 Muslim nations coming together, some immensely powerful, wealthy nations, and everybody in that room was unified. And the ones that weren't, they're trying to get them to be unified and to do the right thing. I think it could have a tremendous impact.\nBut not only that; I said, for me to go, I'm only going—we had to negotiate—if you spend billions of dollars—billions—on having things manufactured in our country with our jobs and our workers for your country. And hundreds of billions of dollars was spent and given to American companies who are going to make American products and send those products over to the wealthy countries of the Middle East. I mean, hundreds of billions of dollars. And people haven't talked about that, but to me that was very important, because we want those jobs. We want those jobs.\nSo they're making airplanes. They're making all sorts of things. Hundreds of billions of dollars, and it's going back. And I'm very proud of that. That's something people don't talk about, because the real purpose of my being there was to make sure these countries do not fund terror any longer.\nSo I just want to leave Iowa—I said that I'd come back.\nAudience member. Don't go! Don't go!\nThe President. Oh, I love that you're not—look. Look at that. You don't want me to leave. I don't want to leave either. I don't—I don't want to leave either. I don't want to leave either. But I said I would come back. And I made lots of statements to your Governor and to your current Governor. Kim is going to be a fantastic Governor. She's here. She's going to be a fantastic Governor.\nBut I said that I was going to come back. I said that I was going to protect your ethanol for good reason. Only for good reason. And it was very important to me. I said that I was going to do things for the people of Iowa, and I want to let you know: I've done it for the people of Iowa, but I've really done it for the people of our country. Our country is getting stronger; it's getting better. We're going to be setting records in so many different ways. We're going to straighten out all of the mess that's happened over the last long period of time, where we went into other nations to tell them how to run their country, and we had no idea.\nBut I just want to thank all of the people that are here tonight. I want to thank the people of Iowa. You are incredible people. I want to thank you for your incredible support. And I just want to let you know that God blesses you. And I want to just say you are special in every way. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-06-21", "title": "Remarks at a \"Make America Great Again Rally\" in Cedar Rapids, Iowa"}

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126501", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you all for that warm welcome, and thank you to Jane Harman for that very kind introduction and those stirring words. And thank you for your leadership at the Wilson Center. I served in the Congress of the United States with Jane Harman and it was always better to be with her than against her. (Laughter.) Do join me in thanking Jane Harman for her great leadership here at the Wilson Center.\nLet me also mention someone, who, as Jane noted, is not here today but may well be looking on. When I grew up in a small town in Southern Indiana, there was a fixture in that town -- someone who was actually elected to the Congress from Columbus, Indiana, but he was no stranger to anyone in the town. On any given week it would be easy to find Congressman Lee Hamilton walking down Washington Street in Columbus, Indiana, stopping on the curb -- always available. I have great memories, although it may pain him, of the times that he visited my high school and would lean against the teacher's desk and explain in a way that he's so capable of the uniqueness and specialness of the United States House of Representatives. And, Lee, I know you're looking on today, and while our politics are still different, my respect for you is boundless. Thank you for your service to the country, and thank you for your leadership in your years here at the Wilson Center. God bless you. (Applause.)\nIt's an honor to be here at the Director's Forum with the members and friends of this well-respected institution -- an institution of \"independent research, open dialogue, and actionable ideas.\" It's truly a bipartisan stalwart here in Washington, D.C. -- the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. I'm honored to have the opportunity to speak to so many leaders from public life, academia, and the international community, especially. And to all of you, I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nAnd I'm here, at the President's direction, to reaffirm the United States' commitment to, in his words, an America First agenda -- an agenda of advancing security and prosperity and freedom across the world. And I'm also here to reaffirm our commitment to the Western Hemisphere as a whole and especially the nations and people of Central America.\nBut before I do, let me, again, thank the Wilson Center for hosting this forum and for all you do all across this country. The Wilson Center and all of you gathered here today have a unique perspective on America's essential role in global affairs. And that's been true since the founding of this institution in 1968. You recognize that the world looks to America as the standard bearer for freedom; that American strength is critical to peace and prosperity across the wider world.\nFrom the outset of this administration I can tell you, we've been busy. We've been busy holding up that standard in the world, but we've also been busy here at home keeping our promises to the American people.\nQuick report for my fellow citizens gathered here today. President Trump has signed 39 bills into law since Inauguration Day. He's actually signed more bills into law rolling back federal red tape than any President in American history. And along the way in the first 100 days, we confirmed a principled jurist to the Supreme Court of the United States in Justice Neil Gorsuch. The President's put a renewed focus on American energy, set the stage for historic tax relief for working families and American businesses.\nAnd today, my fellow Americans here can be assured before this summer is out, working with the Congress, President Donald Trump will keep his promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Following on the work of the House of Representatives, today the United States Senate released its repeal-and-replace bill.\nAnd the President and I are grateful to Leader Mitch McConnell and all the Senate Republicans for their deliberative efforts over the past month. We look forward to working with the Senate majority to move this legislation forward. And the President and I are determined, before this summer is out, to keep our promise to the American people -- to repeal and replace Obamacare and give the American people the kind of world-class healthcare they deserve.\nSo we've been busy here at home. But in case you haven't noticed, we've been busy abroad, as well. Since day one of this administration, President Trump has been taking decisive action to restore America's role as the leader of the free world by putting America first. Just last week, in defining his foreign policy, President Trump said that the United States is adopting a principled realism rooted in our values, our shared interests, and common sense.\nAnd this President, by his actions, has shown the world that America Ffirst does not mean America alone. Since the outset of this administration, President Trump has engaged with the wider world in new and in renewed ways, and this President has rebuilt America's standing in the world and forged even stronger ties with our allies and friends across the globe.\nPresident Trump has personally spoken to foreign leaders 93 times since he's taken office. He's hosted 32 foreign leaders at the White House. In fact, President Trump hosted Japanese Prime Minister Abe, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, Prime Minister May of the United Kingdom, and of course, Chinese President Xi of the People's Republic of China, just to name a few. And in just a few days, the President will host the new President of South Korea and the Prime Minister of India -- yesterday, was speaking to the new Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\nThe world saw the leadership that this American President has taken on the world stage just last month when President Trump traveled to the Middle East and Europe. And our President took the occasion of that trip to reaffirm historic alliances and forged new partnerships to ensure the safety and security of the American people in a time of widening challenges and unknowable threats.\nFor my part, I can tell you it's been very humbling and a great privilege for me to have the opportunity to represent this President and meet many world leaders here in Washington, D.C. and travel across the world on the President's behalf. In February, the President sent me to the Munich Security Conference to deliver a message to the nations and people of Europe that under President Trump, the United States strongly supports our North Atlantic alliance and strongly supports NATO, and we will be unwavering in our commitment to that alliance. (Applause.) The President had me deliver a message then that he reiterated on his recent trip that we expect our allies to live up to their word. We expect NATO to continue to evolve as changing threats occur in the world stage. I reiterated this message in Brussels in my meeting with NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg, and at the President's direction, I met with leaders from the European Union to reinforce our ties with those nations as well.\nBut President Trump also dispatched me to the Asian Pacific to strengthen our alliances and partnerships across that vital region with South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Australia on the itinerary and all the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. I had the opportunity to meet with the representatives of ASEAN when I was there.\nAs I told them, our primary focus was on the greatest threat to security in the Asian Pacific -- the brutal regime in North Korea. And my message was very straightforward: When it comes to North Korea, under this administration, the era of strategic patience is over.\nThis week, American hearts broke with the news that Otto Warmbier had passed away shortly after being restored to his family from his brutal incarceration at the hands of the regime in North Korea. And our prayers are with Otto's family and friends today as they lay him to rest and give their final goodbyes.\nAs the President said just a few days ago, North Korea's treatment of Otto Warmbier was a disgrace. And I can assure you it only deepens our determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people in the days ahead.\nAs I expressed on the President's behalf on my trip to the Asian Pacific, under this administration, the United States will continue to work diligently with our allies across the region and China and the wider world to bring increased economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on North Korea. And we will do so until North Korea abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programs once and for all. (Applause.)\nUnder the leadership of President Trump, the United States stands strong for our most cherished ideals. And to protect these ideals, we stand with our allies and our partners across the world. And that holds true here in our hemisphere, and literally with our neighbors to the south. We feel a connection, as I said last week in Miami -- a connection in history, a connection in geography. And I'm here to tell you, Latin America is a priority for the Trump administration. (Applause.)\nOur partnerships and alliances throughout the region are critical to our national interests. The President has said -- in his words -- it's best for America to have freedom in the Western Hemisphere. And last Friday, on that count, as Jane just mentioned, the President took decisive action to end the last administration's failed policy toward Cuba and support the courageous Cuban people in their six-decade struggle for liberty.\nUnder this administration, the United States now will restrict financial transactions with repressive military, security and intelligence services of the Castro regime and instead redirect lawful commerce to entrepreneurs, to private enterprises in Cuba, and to all those brave Cuban citizens who yearn for freedom and for a brighter future.\nNo longer will America enrich the Cuban regime at the expense of the Cuban people. Because America stands for opportunity, not oppression; for liberty, not tyranny. The Cuban regime must make real progress on human rights and individual freedom. And as the President has said, our policy will not change until all political prisoners are freed, freedoms of assembly and expression are respected, all political parties are legalized, and free and internationally supervised elections occur. That's what American leadership looks like. (Applause.)\nBut, as we all know, Cuba is not the only nation in the region where democracy and freedom are in steep decline and at risk of being completely eradicated. It's increasingly true of the troubled nation of Venezuela. Venezuela's collapse into authoritarianism and anarchy has been heartbreaking to see. The people of that once-rich nation now suffer rampant crime and grinding poverty on a daily basis.\nJust as we stand with the people of Cuba, under President Trump, the United States stands with the people of Venezuela. The United States of America condemns the Maduro regime's abuse of power and the abuse of its people, and we call upon the Maduro regime to restore a robust democracy and the rule of law, and do it now. (Applause.)\nThroughout this week, our diplomats at the Organization of American States General Assembly in Cancun worked with likeminded partners to build a consensus in support of democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela. We were, frankly, disappointed that the OAS did not act in the face of crisis and was unwilling to protect the inter-American democratic charter that was founded to preserve.\nNevertheless, 20 nations did courageously speak out against the Maduro regime's repression. And to them, we say thank you. And rest assured, the United States of America will continue to support international efforts to restore freedom, democracy and the rule of law to Venezuela until freedom occurs. (Applause.)\nAmerica cares deeply for the plight of the Venezuelan people and the Cuban people, because what happens in our neighborhood affects everybody in the neighborhood. And that holds true in Central America. Under President Trump, the United States has three priorities when it comes to that vital region, particularly in the Northern Triangle nations of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. We seek to destroy the gangs and criminal networks, to halt illegal immigration.\nAnd lastly, we're working to stop the flow of illegal drugs into our country, into our communities that are tearing apart American families. Last Thursday, at the President's direction, I traveled to Miami to discuss these goals at the Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America that we organized along with our ally, Mexico. The conference was co-hosted by our Departments of State, Homeland Security, and the government of Mexico.\nAnd in my remarks, I commended Foreign Minister Videgaray and Interior Minister Osorio for their actions to address the serious problems throughout the region. And I had time with the foreign minister privately when we were there. Mexico is a valued partner of this administration. And we will continue to seek ways to advance security and prosperity in the region with them. (Applause.)\nWhen we met, I reaffirmed that the United States is grateful for the significant investments made by leaders in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to strengthen security, to promote prosperity, and to bring real reforms to their nations, and to promote reform across the region. And on President Trump's behalf, I assured them the United States is with them.\nWe stand with them to root out corruption and crime. We stand with them to stop the scourge of illegal drugs and illegal migration. And under President Donald Trump, the United States stands with the nations and the people of the Northern Triangle to ensure a brighter future for themselves and their posterity. (Applause.)\nThese three nations literally sit at the heart of the Western Hemisphere, where north meets south. And every day, countless people and products pass over their streets, through their airports, their seaports, and across their borders. By and large, this flow of commerce and crowds benefits us all, and the exchange of cultures as well as goods and services. But, as we all know, Central America is also plagued by vicious gangs, vast criminal organizations that drive illegal immigration and carry illegal drugs north into the United States.\nSad truth is that American demand is driving the flow of drugs. And fully 80 percent of documented drug smuggling travels through Central America. The cartels and kingpins cause untold suffering in that region, and so too do these merchants of death spread violence and leave victims all across America. President Trump has said this must end. And working with our allies in the region, and with men and women of law enforcement in this country, this will end. (Applause.)\nThe President has already taken decisive action to protect the American people from the harshest consequences of illegal immigration and the transnational drug trade. At the President's direction, American law enforcement is targeting gangs and criminals like never before. As President Trump has pointed out, criminal cartels like MS-13 are being decimated, in his words, and being sent directly to prison.\nThanks to President Trump and with the help of our partners in Mexico and in the Northern Triangle, reports of illegal border crossings at America's southern border are already down nearly 70 percent since the first of this year.\nThis progress is remarkable. But President Trump knows that fully addressing these problems requires confronting them in new and in renewed ways. And just last night, President Trump called for new immigration rules that will say that those seeking admission to our country would not be able to do so unless they can support themselves financially. And he promised to take action very shortly to ensure that that is the policy and practice of the United States.\nAnd beyond our immigration laws, the United States is committed to addressing the demand for illegal drugs here in our nation, which drives so many of the problems south of our border. And finally, under President Trump, the United States is firmly committed to cracking down on the gangs and criminals before they ever reach this nation; to partnering with nations in Central and South America to foster prosperity and give their people the opportunities they need to prosper.\nAs we all know, the United States has long partnered with nations in the region to accomplish these goals. Under President Trump, this administration is now directed to continue to work in new and renewed ways with our partners to support the programs that prove effective. The President made that clear in our commitment when he requested an additional $460 million in our budget for security and prosperity in Central America. Yet the most important work throughout the region belongs -- the President and I know -- to the nations and the people who call the region home.\nAs I said at the conference in Miami last week, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador must now redouble their efforts to bring about the reforms that will protect their citizens and promote economic growth; to give people hope, a reason to put down roots in their own homes; to give them a vibrant economy and an alternative to a life of poverty or, worse, a life of crime. I made it clear that they must bring in new partners in the business community, in the faith community, and the public sector to ensure continued progress.\nNow, I am pleased to report that the conference in Miami has already generated concrete results. At the conference, key private sector leaders identified policies that will promote sustainable economic growth and create a more attractive destination for investment. And the Northern Triangle governments have now committed to enact the kind of reforms to improve their business climates, including minimizing red tape, improving transparency, and streamlining business formalization and processes.\nThree nations have also committed to develop a roadmap to enhance economic integration in the region, and streamline import/export systems and customs procedures. And we began initial discussions to further integrate energy markets and develop infrastructure.\nAnd on security, the United States is committed to enhancing our work with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries to combat organized crime, strengthen citizen security, improve border security, and promote regional security cooperation through programs that are focused on capacity building and information sharing.\nThese steps are encouraging, and I hope all of you find them as heartening as we do. And in the days and months ahead, I can assure you this administration will continue to work with the Northern Triangle, and with all of Central and South America, to promote prosperity and security throughout the Western Hemisphere.\nAs I announced last week, in less than two months, at the President's direction, I will be trying to build on the work that's been done thus far in this administration. I'll be traveling to Colombia, Argentina, and Chile, and Panama to represent the United States and the commitment of this administration to the nations and the people of that region. And it will be my great honor to go.\nEach of these nations is an important partner for this administration, and I look forward to discussing areas of shared concern and new opportunities for collaboration, for the benefit of our people and the benefit of this hemisphere that we all call home.\nWe are, all of us, bound together -- as I said at the outset, we're bound together by history and geography in this new world. And under the leadership of President Trump, I believe we're entering a new era in the new world. The Old Book tells us that we should encourage one another and build each other up, just as, in fact, we are doing.\nUnder President Trump's leadership, I can assure you that we will build on the foundation of friendship in this hemisphere, between our lands and between our people. Together, we will achieve new heights of security and prosperity. And I have faith that with our partners across this hemisphere, and with the help of all of you gathered here, and with President Trump in the White House -- together, we will claim the promise of a brighter future for ourselves, for our hemisphere, and for generations to come.\nSo, thank you. And God bless you. And God bless the work you do in these halls. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)\nMS. HARMAN: Well, Mr. Vice President, I was looking out at the heads nodding as you charted the course of continued U.S. engagement in the world. It matters a lot to my colleagues at the Wilson Center and this international audience that the United States project strong and secure and sure leadership. And the things you were talking about are really central to doing that, so thank you. And thank you also for doing something that I know is unusual so far in your vice presidency and that is agreeing to take a few questions. And I offer these questions on behalf of myself, but also my colleagues and some in the audience, and they relate specifically to the summit, which is our topic today.\nSo you described what is happening coming out of the summit, which is only a week ago. Time flies. What's new? What are things that you are doing that, perhaps, the past administrations -- all of which talked about Latin America and most of the leaders visited Latin America. What's different in the approaches you're taking, especially in the Northern Triangle?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Jane, and again thank you for the opportunity to be here and thank you all for making time to be here for this forum today. I think what's new is a new and renewed engagement that combines security and prosperity as co-equal goals in the region, and perhaps especially in the Northern Triangle.\nOur Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary Kelly, in his last assignment, when it was General Kelly, forged extraordinary relationships with leaders in countries across the region. And at the President's direction, he tasked Secretary Kelly and Secretary Tillerson to bring together the nations in the region around the conference that's focused on both of those issues, and to seek ways that we could work with countries in the region to fight insecurity, impunity, lack of opportunity, but also coordinate in ways that would advance public safety in those nations and our national security.\nAs I mentioned in my speech, I think what's also new is a renewed energy that we see, particularly in the Northern Triangle, to advance not only cooperation on security issues -- which, in the case of almost all the countries, has been strong in other countries in the region -- but, also as I described, the discussion of standardizing customs rules, of creating a more attractive business environment.\nWe actually had at the conference last week a significant number of American businesses who have a great interest or would consider investing in the region, and connecting those businesses with those countries we believe is a key part of advancing our security and prosperity interests.\nSo I think it's a holistic approach, looking at security and prosperity simultaneously; a great focus on promoting the kind of reforms in the Northern Triangle that we think will advance their prosperity and our interests. And that's what might be fresh.\nMS. HARMAN: Well, I applaud you for that, and for sending\n-- I applaud the administration for sending the A-team down there. And just so you know, Secretary Kelly is no stranger to the Wilson Center. The Homeland Secretary Department has some offices in this building, and he's already hosted one of his advisory board meetings -- I sit on that board -- here at the Wilson Center. And he does offer unique leadership because of his experience as head of the Southern Command.\nSo congratulations to you -- and also to him.\nLet me turn to Mexico. You mentioned Mexico and the fact that Mexico co-chaired the conference -- I think that was a brilliant idea -- and that Vice President Videgaray and others were there. There have been a few bumps in the road in terms of a relationship with Mexico in the last months, but there have also been some very good stories. And it's complicated, as they say.\nThe Southern border between Mexico and the Northern Triangle is, I think, quite secure now. And that's a great credit to Mexico. The Northern border with the U.S. between Mexico and the U.S., as you said, is working better. Bad people are being stopped at the Northern border.\nWhat are your expectations in the relationship with Mexico? And what do you want them to do to be the best ally for the United States? And what do you think the United States should do to be the best ally for Mexico?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you for making mention in your remarks and reiterating it. This was a conference that was conceived of when the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security visited Mexico earlier this year and said, where are ways that we can begin to work together on issues of common interest.\nAnd I don't want to paper over -- look, we're in the Reagan Building, and President Reagan is my second favorite President. (Laughter.) He had some memorable lines. One of them is, a nation without borders is not a nation. And people know that President Trump has made it clear we're going to invest in border security, we're going to build a wall. We're going to secure the Southern border of the United States of America. And he's spoken very plainly about that, both in the campaign and in the course of this administration.\nBut that being said, we've also been engaging with Mexico. I know that's created some tension, but we've also been engaging with Mexico on areas where we strongly agree. And we do strongly agree on the issue of transnational migration. And you're right, Mexico has made great progress securing their Southern border. We've been providing assistance to them with regard to confronting criminal gangs, and we will continue to.\nWe also just minted a very successful trade agreement on sugar with Mexico. And so where we agree to disagree, where we have differences, our friends will always know where those are. But I can assure all those present that we're going to continue to work with the Mexico as a critical partner in the region, critical partner in this hemisphere, and dealing with the issues of promoting security in the region and promoting prosperity in the region is in the interest of the United States of America.\nAnd so I appreciate that. We saw Miami as a great example of both governments' commitment to find things that we can work on together, and we'll continue to do so.\nMS. HARMAN: Well, I'm totally unbiased, but our Mexico Institute here at the Wilson Center is absolutely best in class. And we're really proud -- Duncan Wood, where are you? We're really proud of what we have. And we're happy to have it. (Applause.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: That's great.\nMS. HARMAN: So turning to a painful subject -- drugs. You mentioned it, Mr. Vice President. And this morning, I was on Capitol Hill participating on something called the National Security Forum. And John Kelly was there, and he said, \"Our drug demand is brutalizing Northern Triangle societies.\" Our drug demand. The U.S. drug demand. The pull factor. I mentioned that 90 percent of the cocaine last year that came into our country came in from Central America to Mexico to the U.S.\nAnd I don't think it's as big a problem in Indiana as perhaps opioids are, but it's a huge problem in California, my home state of California. You mentioned that we're doing things. But we've spent billions of dollars on this problem. What can this administration do hopefully to solve this problem?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that the President's view of this is that we've got to deal with this in a multifaceted way. It's the reason why the President has taken decisive action to secure our borders and to prevent the flow of illegal drugs into our country to begin with.\nWe've also, with the Justice Department, working with local law enforcement, we've been taking swift and decisive action against drug gangs across this country -- not just people that are in the country illegally that are involved in these gangs, but we're moving very swiftly to interdict. We announced 12 cities' federal grants just yesterday morning, and are encouraging even greater collaboration.\nBut the President also recognizes that while we must vigorously secure our borders, we must vigorously enforce our laws. We've also got to recognize, particularly when it comes to opiate abuse and addiction, that we've got to lean into this challenge with new and compassionate efforts. I mentioned healthcare reform, which continues to make progress on Capitol Hill. And we remain hopeful that there will be action in the coming days in the United States Senate.\nI can tell you that, as governor of the state of Indiana, our Medicaid program that we were able to modify through a state waiver plan was enormously important in dealing with opiate abuse and drug abuse and addiction in our state. And we're working with members of Congress to give states greater flexibility to focus resources in Medicaid on the point of the need.\nI have to tell you, I've sat at kitchen tables with recovering addicts, great young people, top of their class, promising futures who found themselves addicted to opiates, oftentimes beginning with prescription medication that then avalanched into heroin abuse. And then I've also sat at kitchen tables with parents who buried their children. And that's one of the reasons why the President tapped Governor Chris Christie, established a commission to confront opiate abuse in the country. And our administration is deeply committed to identifying new approaches.\nVigorous law enforcement, strong border security, but also finding ways that we can extend health and healing and compassion to people that are caught up in the grip of drug abuse and addiction in this country. The approach has to be multifaceted, and President Trump is committed to advancing that in our administration.\nMS. HARMAN: Well, I appreciate your use of the word \"compassion.\" And maybe we could add prevention too, if there's a way, possibly, to start -- to stop the process before it starts. Because it is taking our youngest and best lives.\nFinally, you mentioned North Korea. I'm not going to ask you about North Korea, but it obviously is an urgent problem, something else that we know a great deal about at the Wilson Center. But North Korea, the problems in Syria, challenges around the world are also commanding U.S. attention. And so my question is, how does this conference las week on security and prosperity in Central America fit into our broader engagement in the region and in the world?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I think the conference this week was an expression of the President's desire to ensure that we are advancing security and prosperity in our neighborhood. Even as we see widening asymmetrical threats developing around the world we'd do well to see to Central and South America to ensure that these countries are advancing the kind of reforms that will encourage growth, promote prosperity and promote security.\nAnd we also -- I was with the President in Miami at the close of our conference when he announced that we were abandoning the last administration's policy on Cuba and implementing -- new approach demanding that if -- Cuba live up to the empty promises it made to the last administration about advancing reforms. And we'll hold them to that.\nAnd also, the issue of Venezuela, which continues to spin out of control. The headlines this morning about even new developments in Venezuela -- I think the President will continue to call for real leadership in the region to bring pressure on Venezuela, to hold elections as their constitution requires, and to uphold free elections and the rule of law.\nAnd so I think it's -- for us it's about putting first things first. And the first priority of President Trump and this administration is the safety and security of the American people. And that begins with ensuring the security and prosperity of nations in this region, but also I think people have seen, as I mentioned in the first part of my speech, this is a President who will always stand for America first. That doesn't mean America alone.\nWhat I've seen this President do in one meeting after another in the Oval Office, what the world saw him do as he traveled around the world was engage -- engage on behalf of the United States, engage on behalf of the people of this country and our vital national interests. But the United States is engaging. We're going to continue to engage.\nI think that involves diplomacy. The President believes strongly that involves rebuilding our military to ensure that we have the readiness and capability as the arsenal of democracy to see to our vital national interests around the world and those of our treaty allies.\nBut it all begins close to home, and I hope, as we confront challenges in the Middle East, in the Asia Pacific, and we confront them with firmness and resolve and with clarity, that our neighbors in this hemisphere know that we're also with them, we stand with them, and we are determined to advance the peace and security and prosperity of this hemisphere.\nSo I thank you, Jane. Thank you for the invitation. And thank you all for making time to join us here today. God bless you. (Applause.)\nMS. HARMAN: Well, if I just might add one thing -- and then we'll applaud you again -- you started your comments by talking about Lee Hamilton. And Lee Hamilton was a mentor to me, as well as to you, and he was a role model in the United States Congress of the kind of person we need more of. He was well-informed. He was humble. He was bipartisan. He was friendly. And if he were here, he'd be totally embarrassed by these comments. He provided enormous leadership at the Wilson Center for 12 years, and with other Hoosiers like Dick Lugar, showed that bipartisanship can work.\nSo it's just my plea to a town where there is too much partisanship that Lee Hamilton remain as a model not just to the Wilson Center and to me and to Vice President Pence, but to all of us.\nAnd in this spirit, thank you so much for coming here. It's a huge honor for us. (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2017-06-22", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at the Wilson Center"}
{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126502", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:26 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. This morning, the President continued his week of events highlighting technology and how it will continue to contribute to the economy of the future by bringing leaders in the industry to the White House to discuss emerging technologies. The President met with them after they participated in working groups separated by topic -- unmanned aircraft systems, 5G wireless connectivity, and financing -- where he saw firsthand how these important technologies are reshaping modern life.\nThroughout this week, the administration has been putting the spotlight on the technologies that will improve the lives of every American, from cell towers as small as pizza boxes, to data analysis that helps our farmers and ranchers get their biggest yields, and having productive discussions with the industry on how government can both help them get there and take advantage of these incredible achievements for the American people.\nTomorrow, the President will focus on an issue that can have important responsibility to address, and that's caring for our nation's veterans. The President will be signing the VA Accountability Act, an important step in fulfilling the commitment he made when he signed an executive order on accountability for VA employees who fail our veterans.\nAs the President has said many times, we must never tolerate substandard care for our nation's heroes, and this bill will provide the VA with the tools it needs to improve the care and services that veterans receive. And he's glad to be signing it tomorrow morning.\nThis morning, the Senate released the discussion draft of its healthcare bill. The President is pleased to see the process moving forward swiftly in Congress, and he looks forward to seeing a finalized bill on his desk so that we can finally repeal and replace Obamacare before it completely collapses.\nJust yesterday, another insurer announced that it's pulling out of Obamacare exchanges. Anthem is leaving the exchanges in Indiana -- the state in which the company was actually born and is currently headquartered -- and also in Wisconsin.\nFinally, I want to welcome Alex Pfeiffer to his first White House briefing. Alex is young, so he might need some help from a few of his colleagues to help him with this process. And with that, ladies and gentleman, I'll take your questions.\nKevin.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I'm just curious about the President's revelation by way of Twitter that he has no knowledge of any tapes -- didn't have any tapes, doesn't have any possession of any tapes. What can you tell the American people about why he decided to sort of make the inference, at least at some point, that maybe there would be tapes?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think the President's statement via Twitter today is extremely clear. I don't have anything to add beyond the statement itself.\nQ: Can I follow up really quickly on the wall? I was at the rally last night. The President seemed to get great reaction to the idea that the wall was moving forward. And he mentioned the possibility of solar as a means to not only pay for the wall itself but also to enhance the wall. Can you sort of help me unpack that idea? Is this something that he's been kicking around for quite some time? He said it was the first time he'd made it publicly known.\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's something he's considering. It's certainly nothing final, but just an idea that he is considering and reviewing. Nothing more than that at this point.\nQ: I have a healthcare question but I just want to follow up on Kevin's questions on the tapes situation. I get that the tweet is speaking for itself, but I'm curious why it took so long, 41 days, for this to be laid to rest, and whether the President is recording any Oval Office conversations.\nMS. SANDERS: You guys asked for an answer; he gave you one. He said he would have it to you by the end of this week, which he did. And beyond timing of that, I can't really speak anything further.\nQ: And any Oval Office recordings?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of anything. I think his statement here is pretty clear.\nQ: But I'm asking more generally, just not specifically to Comey, but, again, he --\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of, Hallie.\nQ: So no Oval Office recordings that you're aware of?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of.\nQ: And then on healthcare, I just want to know a couple of things on that. Is the President confident that he will have something to sign in the next few weeks?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think we're as focused on the timeline as we are on the final product. We're looking for the best bill possible, and we're going to continue being part of technical assistance and providing that with both House and Senate members as we work to get the best bill we can.\nQ: And just on that final product, the President -- this Senate bill, by analysis so far, cuts Medicaid. It doesn't look like it will cut deductibles for folks. Does that have enough heart? Does the President think that is a bill that is not mean?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had that conversation but I do know that he made a statement earlier that said this is a negotiation, and so he's going to continue that process with both House and Senate members and his administration until we get the best bill that we can, and that will be the one that he signs.\nQ: So he's open to changes.\nMS. SANDERS: John.\nQ: Sarah, what was the President doing with this? I mean, he let it go on for 41 days, as Hallie referred to. That tweet 41 days ago seemed to be, you know, a very kind of ominous message to Comey -- \"he better hope there are no tapes.\" And then he was asked repeatedly during the intervening weeks whether or not the tapes existed. You were asked many times. Sean was asked. Why the game? What was he doing?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know there was a game. Again, he's answered the question. He gave a timeline and the frame that -- which he would, and he did that. He said by the end of this week and he's done that.\nQ: Do you have a sense for -- what was behind the original suggestion from him 41 days ago that there may be tapes?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think it was pretty clear in that original statement that he hoped for his sake. And that was, I think, the very intention. And he's laid out his position on whether or not he personally was involved in that in his tweet today.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Back to the original tweet, did the President intend to threaten James Comey with that tweet?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of. I don't think so.\nQ: And so why -- again, why was he compelled for the deadline to be this week, to clear it up?\nMS. SANDERS: I mean, that was -- has been laid out, I believe, also by Congress that they wanted an answer by the end of this week.\nPeter.\nQ: Sarah, if I can, the tweet ultimately, we know, according to James Comey, led him to share the memos publicly, which led to the hiring of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, which ultimately led to the reports that the President himself is being investigated for possible obstruction of justice. Does the President regret the tweet?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think so.\nDavid.\nQ: Then broadly, he said -- you can't say whether there are any Oval Office recordings, but he did say that \"[I] did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.\" Did he ever have recordings of conversations with James Comey?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, not that I'm aware of.\nQ: Let me ask about healthcare, if I can, quickly. On healthcare, the President said when he first became a candidate after coming down the escalator, he tweeted, \"The Republicans who want to cut SS & Medicaid are wrong. A robust economy will Make America Great Again!\" So if cutting Medicaid was wrong when he was a candidate, why is it right in the new Republican Senate bill?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't believe that the President has specifically weighed in that it's right to cut Medicaid. I know one of the big parts of discussion is giving states flexibility. And again, the President hasn't weighed in specifically on any specific measure in this bill, and, as he said earlier, this is a negotiation between the House and the Senate and we're going to play a part in that.\nQ: Does the President still believe there should be no --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, guys, can you -- one at a time.\nQ: Does the President still believe, as he did as a candidate, that there should be no cuts to Medicaid?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had a specific conversation to see if there is an update to that, but I do know that he wants to protect that as much as possible.\nDavid.\nQ: What specifically will the White House be doing with the Senate as this healthcare moves forward? You mentioned technical assistance. What does that entail?\nMS. SANDERS: I think -- I know members of OMB, Treasury, and certainly members of the HHS and senior staff have been involved in the process. They're going to continue to do that. This has been one of those things where, from the very beginning, we've wanted all the stakeholders involved. And we're going to continue to do that until we get the best piece of legislation.\nQ: Will the President be involved, or is he going to wait for the conference committee, which, presumably, will --\nMS. SANDERS: I know he's been involved by having members of his administration -- I think it would be hard to deny the fact they're an extension of the administration when you have Cabinet secretaries and senior-level staffers that are in meetings and conversations regarding the legislation.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Twelve days ago, the President announced a press conference in two weeks on his entire ISIS strategy. Can we expect a press conference in the coming days?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll have to get back to you on a specific date for when that might be.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. I wanted to ask you just -- about some of the reaction from the left that we've seen this week.\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sure it's friendly.\nQ: Well, our microphones caught a woman who was dragged off from McConnell's office this morning. She was screaming, \"My child is going to die, and my family is going to die, but they don't give a damn about it.\" Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said this week, \"The Democrats are going to lie down on the train tracks\" to stop this bill from passing. What do you make of all that? What's your reaction to that?\nMS. SANDERS: I certainly think that not just Republicans, but I think any American would certainly not support something that allows a child to die. And the goal is, again, to look for the best healthcare possible that actually provides care -- not just gives insurance but actually provides care. That's been a goal from the administration on the front end, and we're looking for ways to do that.\nRight now, we know Obamacare is not sustainable. It is literally collapsing under itself. Providers are pulling out every single day out of states. We are down to multiple counties that don't have providers. And we are working day in, day out to make sure we have the best piece of legislation possible.\nIf Democrats really cared, they would try to be involved in the process. They said from day one that they didn't want to be in the conversation if it had anything to do with repealing and replacing Obamacare. I think that it's sad that they've chosen to play partisan politics instead of trying to have a seat at the table.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. The intelligence community has concluded that the DNC hack was part of a Russian plot to disrupt and influence the 2016 election. I'm wondering, after the President's tweet this morning, why does he continue to dispute that finding and call the hack a \"hoax\"? And then a follow-up, if I may.\nMS. SANDERS: I believe that the President said even back in January -- and I'll read the statement from then -- that he thinks it's a disgrace, thinks it's an absolute disgrace. \"As far as hacking, I think it was Russia, but I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.\"\nI think he's made it clear and been consistent that while everyone agrees the result of the election wasn't influenced, he thinks that it probably was Russia. And I think that regardless, President Trump has made it clear that we have to protect the integrity of the electoral system. That's one of the reasons he's a strong advocate for voter I.D. laws and why he's also put in place a voter election commission -- integrity commission chaired by the Vice President, which I think shows the level of importance he's placed on that to make sure that the integrity of all of our elections, particularly moving forward, are as sound and correct as possible.\nQ: So then -- thank you. Just a broader follow-up on that. So like I said, this morning he called the hack a \"hoax.\" He hasn't accepted the popular vote tallies. You guys have been touting jobs numbers that he used to call \"fake.\" You won't tell us where he stands on climate science. So I'm wondering, why does the President choose to accept certain facts, but dispute and reject others?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware that he accepts certain facts. I think we accept all the facts.\nQ: But like the popular vote totals, climate science. You still haven't told us where he stands on that.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the President won the election. I don't know why we have to continue debating this.\nQ: I'm not debating that point.\nMS. SANDERS: The Democrats lost because they didn't have a message. They had a poor candidate. We had a message. And the President won. I'm not really sure what fact we're disputing here. There's only one winner and he was it.\nJeff.\nQ: Sarah, going back to the tweet, it happened before this gaggle started. Is the President concerned that surveillance is being conducted against him at the White House?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know specifically if there's a direct concern. I do know that he's concerned with the number of leaks that do come out of our intelligence community. I think all Americans should be concerned with that.\nQ: He did make clear in that tweet that he didn't have any recordings, but he raised the prospect that there -- somebody else might have them.\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I think that it's very clear what he meant there, but as far as surveillance --\nQ: But who else would have them, I guess?\nMS. SANDERS: -- I wouldn't know, Jeff.\nMike.\nQ: Two questions. First on healthcare, if I can. Since the President won't be weighing in specifically on any of the details of the Senate bill, can you help explain what his role will be exactly during at least this Senate phase of the process? Will he be whipping for votes to pass the Senate bill, even if he doesn't necessarily agree with everything that's in it, just to try to advance the process along?\nMS. SANDERS: We'll keep you updated as his involvement takes place. Again, right now, I know that he's got a large number of members of his administration that are involved in the process and continuing in those conversations.\nQ: Sarah, another question, if I can. The President is meeting today with the International Olympic Committee. Can you talk a little bit about what that meeting is for, and will he use it as a chance to lobby for Los Angeles's bid for the Olympics?\nMS. SANDERS: I know he's certainly supportive of the committee, and we plan to have a read out after the meeting. I don't want to get head of that before it takes place.\nQ: By the committee, you mean the bid? Or the --\nMS. SANDERS: I mean, obviously, the committee itself -- and again, we'll have a readout for you after the meeting takes place. I won't get ahead of that.\nQ: Sarah, yeah, listen, I want to -- if you don't mind, I want to go back to what Jeff was asking you a moment ago. I know you say this tweet is clear, but it talks about recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking. Is that activity that is being carried out by the CIA, the FBI, or other U.S. law enforcement agencies? Is that what his reference is to?\nMS. SANDERS: I think those are questions you'd have to ask those law enforcement agencies, whether or not they're engaging in those activities.\nQ: But it's the President who has tweeted this. The President is the one who has actually put this information out.\nMS. SANDERS: I think there's public record that talks about surveillance, that talks about unmasking. We know those practices take place. I think if you're asking about specific instances, you'd have to refer to those agencies.\nQ: Can I ask one follow-up on China? The President tweeted obviously the other day that the Chinese had failed to change the situation with respect to North Korea. I just wonder, in light of that, given how he had put China at the center of his North Korea strategy, what the next steps are. How does the U.S. bring pressure to bear on North Korea, if the Chinese are not willing to help?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think the President has been extremely clear on this process. Of course, he hopes to work with China and continue to work with them to put pressure on North Korea. But if that doesn't work, then the President has been clear that he will do whatever it takes to protect America.\nQ: Are there any more details on that? Any details on what that would be?\nMS. SANDERS: The President is never going to outline his strategy in a public way, but I think he's been clear that he would certainly do what it takes to protect American citizens.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two questions. First on healthcare. The Senate wants to vote in less than a week, or in about a week. Can you say whether the President supports the bill as it is right now? Because we don't know how many changes can be made in the course of a week.\nQ: Again, I think he wants to bring the stakeholders to the table, have those conversations, and we'll get back to you as we go through that process. But I think right now we're in a negotiation process.\nJordan.\nQ: Does the President think that the process on healthcare is moving too fast then, if he wants to take time and talk to people? I mean, they're talking about having a vote next week. I mean, this may be like the --\nMS. SANDERS: I mean, we've been talking about reforming healthcare for a number of years. I don't think it's moving too fast when it's been nearly eight years.\nQ: Sarah, if the healthcare bill changes from what it is now, by the time it gets to the President's desk, will the President support a bill that funds Planned Parenthood?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure. I'd have to get back to you on that question.\nQ: Hasn't he that he wouldn't support a bill that does?\nMS. SANDERS: He has. I would have to get back to you on his specific mentality of the bill.\nQ: Well, let me ask you this: If the bill allows the use of healthcare tax credits to buy coverage for abortion, would he support that?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of. But again, I think it would have to be in the context of the larger legislation. I can't speak to a hypothetical on one piece of the bill.\nQ: I wanted to ask more about the China question that Mark Landler brought up. Can you tell us more when you say the President will do what it takes with regard to North Korea? So that would mean a military option. Can you tell us more --\nMS. SANDERS: I think he's said all along that we're not taking any options off the table, but we're not going to broadcast what those might be.\nHunter.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. The intelligence community has been pretty unified and adamant that the Russian interference in the election was a very real and serious issue. Yet the President just called it a \"Dem hoax.\" Does he believe that members of the intelligence community are colluding with the Democrats, or did collude with the Democrats? And what would he do about that?\nMS. SANDERS: I believe the reference in the hoax is about the fact that they're trying to delegitimize his win in the election process, and less about the hack itself. I think he's said several times now that he believes that Russia was part of it, but also, some of those same members have said that they don't think it influenced the election. And I think that's what a lot of this process is about; it's about trying to make excuses for why Democrats lost. And the President, I think, has been pretty clear on where he stands with that.\nZeke.\nQ: Sarah you just directed Mark's -- his questions about the President's tweet earlier to the various intelligence agencies. Is the President accusing elements of the U.S. government of wiretapping the Oval Office?\nMS. SANDERS: That's not what I said. I said if he was asking about specific instances, he would have to ask them.\nQ: So, specifically, does the President believe he's being surveilled in the Oval Office?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of.\nQ: Why is he tweeting about it?\nMS. SANDERS: Because he was asked if he had tapes, and he was answering that question.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. A question and a follow-up. In his speech last night, the President said that several of the major news corporations are not telling the truth to the American people. Are you willing to name any of those corporations? And also, are you keeping a list and following corporations that may not be telling the truth?\nMS. SANDERS: I think there are quite a few instances where there have been false reports out there, and I would be happy when I'm not standing up here to help provide a list to you, John.\nQ: All right. And the other thing is, are you keeping this list ongoing?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't have like a folder on my computer for it. But I certainly think we've got some knowledge of very specific instances that have taken place.\nQ: Are you going to release them?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll let you know.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean -- Sarah. Were you given a heads up in any context --\nMS. SANDERS: We look pretty different. (Laughter.) But, you know.\nQ: It's off-camera.\nMS. SANDERS: Hey, John, if you're looking for instances of fake news, there's a good one for you. (Laughter.) I'm Sarah.\nQ: Were you given a heads up about the President's tweet?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes.\nQ: And was the General Counsel given an opportunity to vet what the President tweeted out?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure. I'd have to double-check on that.\nQ: Sarah, the President talked last night about Governor Branstad going to China to become the ambassador. Is it consistent with the President's pledge to drain the swamp that he's giving so many of these first wave of ambassadorships to political supporters and campaign donors?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think it's pretty traditional that you would have somebody supportive of you and your agenda to go out and be an ambassador to speak on behalf of the administration. And Terry Branstad is somebody who has, I think, some of the best qualifications that you could have to send there. He's got a personal relationship with senior-level members of the Chinese administration, as well as a very strong understanding of trade practices given his background. And I think he's a perfect fit for that role.\nAlex.\nQ: Is legal status for DACA beneficiaries on the table? Has the White House conducted its review of the program?\nMS. SANDERS: As of right now, that's still under review and I don't have any announcements on the specifics of the program at this time.\nQ: Bloomberg reported that the President first raised the prospect of tapes strategically to make sure that Comey told the truth. Is that your understanding of the President's motivation for tweeting about it? And does he feel it was effective?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry? Can you speak -- I can't hear --\nQ: Do you want me to repeat the whole thing?\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah, sorry. No, the air -- It's hard to hear.\nQ: Bloomberg first reported that the President first raised the prospect of tapes strategically to make sure that Comey told the truth. Is that your understanding of the President's motive for tweeting that? And does he feel it was effective?\nMS. SANDERS: I certainly think that the President would hope that the former director would tell the truth. But I think that it was more about raising the question of doubt in general.\nThanks, guys.\nEND 1:47 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-06-22", "title": "Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders"}
{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126505", "text": "THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Chuck Goodrich. Thank you for putting on a tie. (Laughter.) Thanks for that wonderful introduction and for your friendship of so many years. And I'm just so proud of Chuck Goodrich and his leadership role in this great organization. From one Hoosier to another, thank you for your leadership, my friend. And thank you for your friendship of so many years. (Applause.)\nAnd let me also pay a debt of gratitude to another old friend who I worked with back in my days in Congress and when I was Governor of Indiana. He came to be President of ABC Indiana/Kentucky, and is just an inspiring and tenacious leader for everything everyone here fights for -- JR Gaylor. I don't know where you're sitting, but, JR, thank you so much.\nAnd it is great to be back to ABC. (Applause.) This is an organization of red-blooded American patriots who I did, over 10 years ago, proudly call the \"Marine Corps of American politics\" -- (applause) -- first on the beach for freedom in the workplace -- the Associated Builders and Contractors of America. Give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.)\nIt really is an honor to be with all of you today and a privilege for me to bring you greetings from my friend and a builder who is now the 45th President of the United States of America -- President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And on the President's behalf, let me welcome you to a new era for American builders.\nI know you enjoyed hearing from some of our great allies in the Congress -- Congressman Rick Allen, Congressman Francis Rooney, and Congressman Lloyd Smucker. Give them another round of applause. (Applause.) They are great, great champions and we appreciate their support.\nBut I do appreciate the invitation to join you for the ABC 2017 Legislative Conference. As you all know, I have a little bit of history with ABC in Indiana. I first ran for Congress when I was a little bit younger than I am today. (Laughter.) It was back in 1988 -- I was 29 years old. Back when I had dark hair and -- okay, there was a little less of me. (Laughter.)\nBut I have to tell you, ABC was there. When I stepped forward to take on an entrenched incumbent in the Congress, ABC didn't hesitate to give me the support. Well, I came up short the first two times I tried for Congress. And by the time I would be elected to Congress a little more than 10 years later, ABC was there every step of the way. So, on behalf of my little family and the opportunities that we've had to serve in the Congress, to serve as governor, and now to serve as 48th Vice President of the United States of America, let me just say thank you. (Applause.) Thank you for the opportunity to serve.\nThe truth is that the members of ABC fight for a stronger and more prosperous America, for coming alongside men and women like me and my family each and every day. And I'm going to make you a promise: President Donald Trump is fighting every day for all of you and the values of this great organization. (Applause.)\nThis President knows that builders and contractors are the cornerstone of American communities, large and small. And that's especially true of this group. It's amazing to think, for more than 65 years, Associated Builders and Contractors have stood without apology for the time-honored principles of open competition and free enterprise. Your 70 chapters and 21,000 members drive our nation's growth every time you break ground. And just as important, you make sure taxpayers and consumers get the best bang for their buck when it comes to construction. (Applause.)\nThanks in large part to businesses represented here, the construction industry has contributed nearly $800 billion to our economy last year and employed some 6.8 million Americans. But your impact on America extends so much deeper, into the very foundation of our national life. Independent-minded entrepreneurs like you have literally built America from the ground up, from our homes to our hotels, from our restaurants, our retail malls, our stadiums, and our skyscrapers.\nThe truth is Associated Builders and Contractors have the best interests of your workers, the best interests of your communities, and really, you have the best interests of America at heart. You champion fiscal responsibility and individual freedom. And I promise you, the American people are grateful that you are a champion for American values. (Applause.)\nAnd make no mistake about it, President Donald Trump is the best friend American builders and contractors will ever have. (Applause.) This President has promised, simply put, in his words, to rebuild America. And it's businesses like yours that are going to play such a leading role in doing that. Ahead of schedule and under budget, right?\nSince the outset of this administration, businesses, large and small, have been responding to the President's leadership, to that America First agenda. More than 600,000 new, good-paying jobs have been created since the first day of 2017, including 100,000 construction jobs created under this administration. (Applause.)\nAnd business confidence is soaring. In fact, a stunning 97 percent of commercial contractors in America are confident about their prospects this year. And we're on the phone with the remaining 3 percent. (Laughter.) And they should be. Since day one of this administration, President Trump has been fighting tirelessly to get our economy moving again, and it's working, to get your businesses like yours building like never before.\nJust look at this President's decisive action when it comes to federal red tape. This President has signed more laws cutting red tape Washington, D.C. already than any President in American history. (Applause.) The President Trump has actually signed 14 bills under the Congressional Review Act to roll back burdensome regulations from the last administration that have already saved businesses $18 billion a year in regulatory costs. One of my favorites is he actually ordered every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any new federal red tape on America's job creators. (Applause.)\nUnder this President's leadership, specifically, we've repealed the Stream Buffer Rule, we're rolling back the Clean Power Plan, and the Waters of the United States Rule earlier this month is a thing of the past. (Applause.) And President Donald Trump put America first just a few short days ago when he made the decision to withdraw the United States of America from the Paris Climate Accord. (Applause.)\nYou know, according to one independent study, the Paris Accord would have cost the U.S. economy more than 6.5 million jobs in the next 25 years while giving countries like China and India virtually a free pass. As the President said, our administration was elected to represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris. (Laughter.) And be assured, the President put America first, and this President always will. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump is fighting every single day for American industry and American workers. And as you saw last week, during what we called \"Workforce Development Week\" at the White House, President Trump is committed to ensuring that men and women in America have the opportunity to pursue careers in the building trades, vocational education becomes more available for more Americans so your businesses and their futures will grow. (Applause.)\nI mean, we know, at this very moment, the construction industry in particular is facing a workforce shortage of nearly half a million workers in this country. Skilled tradesmen, in particular, are increasingly hard to come by. Carpenters, masons, plumbers, and electricians are all in high demand, but too few Americans these days pursue these valuable careers.\nI know you're already doing your part to address the crisis. ABC's local chapters and centers provide, I'm told, more than 800 apprenticeship and training programs across the country. I saw them firsthand back in the Hoosier State -- the difference that they're making in opening professional doors of opportunities to people for good-paying jobs and great careers.\nBut we must do more -- much more. That's why, just last Thursday, President Trump signed an executive order to, in his words, expand apprenticeships and vocational training to help all Americans find rewarding careers in our building trades, in construction, and in every form of vocation in America. (Applause.)\nThis President truly believes that we need to get back to a time when our students see the skilled trades for what they are, which is a foundation for a great life and a boundless future. An amazing 90 percent of apprentices get jobs after they finish their program, and the average salary is an impressive $60,000 a year. And under this President's leadership, I'm confident we'll train the students of today to meet the jobs of tomorrow, and working families and American businesses are going to be stronger for it.\nIt really is remarkable to think of the changes that we need in this area. The President and I have talked at great length about the changes that we made back in the state of Indiana. We actually reformed funding in our public high schools in the Hoosier State to ensure that there was an incentive -- a financial incentive for schools to offer career-aligned and vocationally aligned education for our high school kids.\nAnd I always would tell people, you know, it's not about plan A and plan B, right? It's about two plan A's. It's about getting back to an America where we have an educational system that gives our sons and daughters the opportunity to develop the background and the skills and the education so that they can start their lives where they want to start their life.\nYou know, it's fundamental to this President's belief that success begets success. When we let our young people start their lives in the careers that they want, they can pursue a boundless future as they discover new aspects of their life.\nI look around this room and I see men and women who I know for a fact, because I've heard it, actually started your educational careers in vocational education. You got out there, you worked on a job site, and now you employ hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of people in good-paying jobs. That's the kind of future we want once again in America, where we honor -- we honor every future and every workplace in America equally. (Applause.)\nYou know, it really is remarkable to think about everything President Trump has accomplished in the past few months. It's been awful busy. From rolling back regulation, to energy, to workforce, and more. But at this White House, that's what my boss calls just a good start, right? (Laughter.) And it's builders like you who elected this President of the United States, and I promise you, straight out of the gate here, we've rolled our sleeves up and we're going to work. We are going to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States of America. (Applause.)\nThis President knows that roads mean jobs. And I'm not just talking about road jobs I'm talking about -- you have the right infrastructure and it supports economic growth and prosperity and opportunity for all the American people. In partnership with all of you, this President is committed to make historic investments in our national infrastructure. And we're going to do it fast and we're going to do it in a fiscally responsible way.\nBut I'll make this promise to you: This President and our administration will not rest or relent until America has the best roads, the best bridges, the best airports, and the best infrastructure in the world once again. So get ready to get busy. (Applause.)\nAnd today, I want to assure you, before this summer's out, working with the Congress, President Donald Trump is going to keep our promise to the American people, and we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nIn fact, a little bit later today, the United States Senate and Republican leadership is going to release a repeal-and-replace bill this morning. You know, the President and I are truly grateful to Leader Mitch McConnell and all the Senate Republicans for their deliberative efforts over the past month.\nIt really is remarkable when you think about it that as Obamacare is collapsing all across this country -- with news in my home state, even yesterday, that I'll talk about in a minute -- that the people that gave us Obamacare have refused to even lift a finger to fix and to clean up the mess that they created. But we're moving forward. And this President and I remain determined that we'll repeal and replace Obamacare before this summer is out.\nThis is the moment. Now is the time. As all of you head to Capitol Hill to talk with your elected representatives, I want you to convey that to each one of them. I want you to tell them the stories of the burden that Obamacare has placed on your businesses and on families in your communities.\nI mean, you all know the grim reality that businesses have been facing under Obamacare. I've heard it from companies large and small as I've traveled all across this country. It really is remarkable. I've traveled on behalf of the President -- the same story everywhere I go. Obamacare stifles your growth. It harms your workers through its mandates, its taxes, its endlessly rising costs of health insurance premiums. And not only is it a burden on your business, it's, most importantly, weighing heavily on the American people.\nLast month, our administration issued a study showing the exact numbers of how Obamacare has led to skyrocketing premiums all across America. We found that health insurance premiums have more than doubled since Obamacare was signed into law. And in many states, they've more than tripled.\nI mean, remember all the broken promises of Obamacare? I was actually in the Congress at the time we were stopping -- trying to stop this thing and -- just was amazing. They said, if you like your doctor you can keep them -- not true. They said, if you like your health insurance you could keep it -- not true. They said that the cost of health insurance would go down -- remember that one? Not true.\nI mean, the last administration actually promised that Obamacare would lower premiums in the individual marketplace by up to $2,500 for American families. Instead, the real numbers -- premiums have increased by nearly $3,000 for families under Obamacare. At this very moment, millions of Americans are facing double-digit premium hikes heading into 2018. And while costs are soaring, choices are plummeting, because insurance companies are pulling out of Obamacare left and right.\nRight now, here's your number -- a third of American counties, including five whole states, have only one choice of Obamacare coverage -– meaning they essentially have no choice at all. And in the past few weeks, health insurers have announced exits from Obamacare markets all across the country. Just yesterday, the last two statewide insurance companies announced they're pulling out of my home state of Indiana in 2018. Nearly 80,000 Hoosiers will need to find a new plan.\nAnd across America, tens of thousands of Americans will have no Obamacare coverage whatsoever next year. In Ohio, more than 13,000 will have no health insurance in 2018. In Missouri, 25 counties won't have any coverage at all. And while the last insurer in 94 of Iowa's 99 counties has said that they're going to stay through next year, two days ago they said the cost of them staying next year is a 43 percent increase in premiums on 72,000 Iowans.\nLook, as the President has said, Obamacare is a disaster, and Obamacare must go. (Applause.) I'll tell you, the President will never stop fighting to give American businesses and the American people the kind of healthcare reform that you need and deserve. And we have confidence that with his leadership, with this Congress, and with your help, we will end the Obamacare nightmare once and for all, and give the American people the kind of world-class healthcare that's built on individual responsibility, free markets, and state-based innovation and reform. That's the American way to lowering costs and healthcare solutions. (Applause.)\nAnd after we repeal and replace Obamacare, I'll make you another promise. This President is going to keep working with the Congress and we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms. (Applause.)\nA little over a month ago, the President laid out a plan that will lower taxes all across this country and get this economy moving again. We're going to simplify the tax code by cutting seven brackets down to three -- 10, 25, 35 percent. You know, there's that old saying that the Internal Revenue code is twice as long as the Bible with none of the good news. (Laughter.) We're going to have some good news this year.\nWe're not only going to lower rates and simplify the tax code, we're going to eliminate the alternative minimum tax, make the code flatter and fairer for everyone. And under President Donald Trump, we're going to repeal the death tax once and for all. (Applause.)\nAnd when it comes to making sure American businesses are competitive, our tax plan is going to put American companies, including our builders and contractors, back on the road to compete. We're going to slash the business tax in this country to 15 percent so American companies can compete with companies all around the world. (Applause.) And when we lower the business taxes, we're going to make sure that small businesses can enjoy the same benefits of big corporations and pass-throughs are going to get tax relief as well. (Applause.)\nWe're going to end the broken system that penalizes companies for calling America home. We're going to cut taxes on trillions of dollars locked away overseas so that American companies can bring those dollars home and invest in America's future.\nThe bottom line is that President Trump's tax cut plan is going to empower your companies to compete on a level playing field with businesses anywhere in the world. And as we all know, when the playing field is level, American businesses will win every single time. (Applause.)\nWe do want to commend Speaker Paul Ryan and Leader Mitch McConnell for their diligent efforts working with this administration to craft tax reform, get this economy rolling again. So let me tell you, discussions will continue. Details are being worked out, but with your support, the support of leaders in Congress, and the leadership of President Donald Trump we will pass historic tax relief and we will pass it this year. (Applause.)\nBefore I leave, let me just continue to urge you, urge you to stand with our President and to partner with this administration as we work to keep our promises to the American people and move our agenda forward. As you meet with your elected representatives this week, all I ask is that you tell them the truth, tell them your story. You know, whether it be about the enormous burden that Obamacare places on your business, about the need to heed the President's call for workforce and vocational education reform, the need for tax reform, the need to rebuild our military to have America standing tall in the world. You are the voices of the American people. Come and let them hear from you. Tell them that you're counting -- you're counting on them to support the President's agenda this year in the Congress.\nTell them we need less regulation and less red tape, lower taxes, better infrastructure, and a better trained workforce. And tell them the time is now, right now, to repeal and replace ObamaCare.\nYou know, President Trump is fighting for each one of you every single day. The man is a fighter -- like nobody I ever met. (Laughter.) I got to tell you, he knows that your success is America's success and every community, large and small, is a testament to your facts. Your businesses have built a firm foundation that has served our nation and our communities for generations, and that forms the basis of everything that's great about America -- opportunities, generosity.\nI do want to commend members of ABC for the corporate citizens that you are in your communities. Having represented a lot of small towns in the Congress, I know you about can't go to a Little League baseball game and you can't go to a local charitable function without seeing the ABC banner hanging on a fence. You folks are always there, and not just when it comes to electoral politics, but you're just always there when the need arises in your communities. So give yourselves a round of applause. You make a difference every day. (Applause.)\nBut you know when I think of these times in which we live and the challenges that lie ahead I'm grateful for the leadership of President Trump. I'm grateful for the support of our allies in Congress and all of you -- all of you who understand the building blocks of policies that will turn this country around and are turning this country around.\nIt gives me great confidence, it does, as I travel this country and have the extraordinary privilege of coming to work every day in the White House. But I also take confidence in timeless wisdom to which Americans have turned throughout our history that speaks particularly of our future and language the builders would appreciate. And its language that we might embrace and remember in these all too divided times in America. As we seek to rebuild this country, let's remember \"unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.\"\nSo as you work to build your businesses, as ABC stands for freedom in the workplace and the reforms that will rebuild America -- if you're of a mind -- I encourage you to repair to those ancient truths. Pray for America. Pray for this country. This one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all -- because America matters far beyond our shores.\nAnd I know with your help, and with God's help, and with that builder in the Oval Office, we will succeed. We will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And, to borrow a phrase, we will make America great again. (Applause.)\nThank you, ABC. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

And on behalf of the First Family we thank you for continuing this wonderful bipartisan tradition tonight on this beautiful evening in our nation's capital.\nSo with good food, good fellowship, and quite a view, join me in welcoming to the podium our host for this evening -- First Lady Melania Trump and the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.

Good morning, everybody. Very nice to have you here. It's a great honor. So many of you I recognize, and others I do from reading business magazines and other magazines. You've done very well. You're very representative of your group.\nAnd, Jeff, congratulations on a great career.\nGE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey R. Immelt. Thank you very much.\nThe President. A great career. I was sad to hear it in one way, and in another way, I said, boy, what a good job.\nMr. Immelt. Thank you very much.\nThe President. So I know whatever you're going to be doing, that's a long time over there. I've known you a long time in that company. I've done deals with that company, and you were there, right? A lot of good friends like Dale Frey and John Myers. We had a good time at GE.\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for being here and for giving us a chance to see some of the really exciting new technology that you've pioneered that will help improve so many millions of lives.\nI want to thank my Office of Science and Technology—and this has been a great office; they have done such incredible work—for organizing today's event and for bringing these wonderful business leaders—and they are at the top—together to talk about the importance of emerging technologies.\nI want to thank Secretary Ross for joining us today. Wilbur, thank you very much. And we just got back from Iowa last night. A big speech in Iowa. That was an amazing group of people. Those people were excited. I guess most people saw it, but they were excited. Wilbur has done a fantastic job, and I want to thank you very much for it, Wilbur. Everybody understands it. Wilbur, as Jeff—as you know—Wilbur is known as just \"Wilbur\" on Wall Street. They don't even call him Wilbur Ross. They just say, oh, Wilbur is involved, right? He's done a great job. Thank you.\nAnd, Mr. Vice President, thank you very much for being here. We've had some busy schedules, and we have a thing called health care that you may hear is percolating in the outside, as we've discussed. And I think it's going to come out. Obamacare is a disaster; it's dead. Totally dead. And we're putting in a plan today that's going to be negotiated. We'd love to have some Democrat support, but they're obstructionists. They'll never support. We won't get one, no matter how good it is. But we will, hopefully, get something done, and it will be something with heart and very meaningful.\nAnd, Steve, it's great to have you here, by the way. Really good. You've done a great job. I always say you've got a hell of a lot of money for that sale. I don't think you've been given enough—[laughter].\nRevolution Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stephen M. Case. [Inaudible] The President. I mean, I don't think you were ever given enough credit for the deal you did for your shareholders. [Laughter] What a deal that was.\nToo many years of excessive Government regulation. We have had regulation that's been so bad, so out of line that it's really hurt our country. And as you see, on a daily basis, we're getting rid of regulation. In fact, Dodd-Frank is now being cut and cut very substantially. We'll have tremendous safeguards, but we're going to have banks that are going to be able to loan money to people so they can open businesses and do what they used to be able to do in this country.\nMy administration has been laser-focused on removing the Government barriers to job growth and prosperity. We formed a deregulation Task Force inside every agency to find and eliminate wasteful, intrusive, and job-killing regulations, of which we've had many.\nWe want our innovators to dream big, like the folks around me and surrounding me in this room. And we want them to create new companies and to create lots of jobs. Your industry has been incredible. Your representation of your companies—this is the reason you're here—has been something that has created so many millions of new American jobs and probably jobs in many other countries also. But we're interested right now in America first.\nWe're on the verge of new technological revolutions that could improve, virtually, every aspect of our lives, create vast new wealth for American workers and families, and open up bold, new frontiers in science, medicine, and communication.\nToday's conversation will move America one step closer to that bright future that we're all talking about and all longing for in your world. I would love to hear about the discussions you've had this morning with our team, the White House, and get your thoughts on ways Government can help unleash the next generation of technological breakthroughs that will transform our lives and transform our country, and make us number one in this field. This is a very, very competitive field. You see what's going on in China and so many other countries. And we want to remain number one. We want to go to number one in certain areas where we're not number one. And we're going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.\nSo thank you all very much for being here.

Wow. Thank you, Vice President Pence. Thank you, Karen. You've been such a tremendous help to me, both of you, and we very much appreciate it. And Melania, myself, we've become great friends. And great job, really great job. Thank you.\nThis has truly become, as you know, a wonderful tradition. It's the very first Congressional Picnic that Melania and I have the pleasure of hosting, so I hope you enjoy it. I hope you enjoy it. We've gotten to know many of you over the last weeks and months and developed many friendships with politicians. Can you believe it? [Laughter] And some really great people, I have to say. Mostly—[laughter]—mostly. A couple of bad ones, but that's okay. [Laughter] But we're honored to host you at the White House and privileged to count you as our very close friends, so many.\nTonight our thoughts and prayers remain with one friend who is not here, a man that we have all come to know and respect and to love: Congressman Steve Scalise. The outpouring of support for Steve and his family has been truly inspiring.\nWe are so touched that joining us here this evening are Steve and Jennifer's children Harrison and Madison. Beautiful children. In fact, we just gave them a tour of the White House so—just gave them a beautiful tour of the White House. They got the A tour. [Laughter] You know, sometimes, we give the B, the C, the D—and the F tour is just, like, here it is, let's get out of here. [Laughter] We gave them the A tour. And I want them to know that the whole country is praying for their courageous dad, and all of us are praying for them.\nIt's been amazing. The recovery is going, now, well. For 2 days, I was saying it's really tough. But today I can report things are looking very, very good. So we're very happy about that.\nI also want to give a very special thanks to Special Agents Griner and Bailey of the Capitol Police—[applause]—lucky they were there—for their lifesaving actions. And all of the Members of Congress—a lot of brave people in Congress—who acted in those moments of danger and protected each other. They cared for the wounded. They shielded the vulnerable. And they really did put their own safety aside. So I want to thank some of those people who were really very, very brave. We would have never maybe found out about them, except we got to see them in action. So now we know for sure. But we want to thank them. There was a great deal of bravery on behalf of everybody.\nAnd you know, Agents Griner and Bailey, they came rushing in from the outfield. Somebody with a rifle, and they had handguns. And that's not a good deal. But one of those bullets struck at the right place, and that was really incredible, or that would have been a far worse morning. Believe me. So we want to thank them.\nAmerica is also filled with pride over the display of character and sportsmanship at the Congressional Baseball Game. I heard it was very special. I wanted to go there, but our folks from Secret Service says maybe we better take a pass. [Laughter] I wanted to be there so badly, you have no idea. But I spent a little time at the hospital instead with Steve. It's our hope that this unity that was displayed that evening can maybe continue to grow and thrive between Republicans and Democrats. And I think, honestly, I think we'd all be doing a lot better, and I know the country would be doing a lot better.\nThe American people have entrusted us with great responsibility, and I know that we will prove worthy of the trust they have placed in each of us. I'm hopeful that the spirit of cooperation that we've seen in recent days will deepen as we move forward. I really believe it's something that can happen. Maybe it's too early. Maybe the wounds are too deep in terms of the relationship, because it's been bad for a long time, long time. Not just when we got there. I mean, this has gone on for many years. And hopefully, those wounds can heal and heal quickly, because we owe it to the American people.\nTonight let us enjoy the company of friends and the comfort of our loved ones. And tomorrow let us continue to do the people's bidding and create the optimistic future our citizens so richly deserve.\nI want to thank you all for being here tonight. It's a very special evening, beautiful evening. And I just want to say God bless you, and God bless America.\nThank you very much. Thank you.

Thank you, Jim, for the kind introduction and for the warm welcome of our family to Focus on the Family. Jim, you're a strong voice for timeless values and families across America, and this country, our President, and our little family are grateful for you and the leadership you've provided. (Applause.) Thank you, Jim.\nYou know it really is an honor to be here today in this beautiful chapel, with so many men and women of faith and such stalwart advocates for family, now for four decades across America.\nI'm grateful that were here to enjoy the music -- (laughter) -- of one of the most inspiring Christian artists in the world --Steven Curtis Chapman. (Applause.) Steve and I met not long ago at the White House. He was there for the National Day of Prayer. And I was really excited, man. (Laughter.) And he came up to me and he said he'd read somewhere that I was a big fan of his. (Laughter.) And, Steven and Marybeth, I just want to say that your ministry of music has been a blessing in my life and I thank you on behalf of all the people whose hearts you've touched and whose faith you've encouraged. (Applause.)\nAnd it's a privilege to be here on this historic day -- the 40th anniversary of a cornerstone of American life for so many Americans, an organization that has been a champion without equal for American families, a bastion of grace that has inspired millions with your model of Christian love. It is great to be here on the 40th anniversary of Focus on the Family. (Applause.)\nWe're grateful to be with all of you to celebrate your history and this ministry. And let me say, I bring greetings and congratulations, as well, on this historic milestone, from a good friend, whose a leader, whose a believer, whose a tireless defender of the values that will make America great -- the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nI'm really here today on the President's behalf to congratulate Focus on the Family 40 years of vision, 40 years of compassion. And most of all I'm here today to congratulate Focus on the Family for 40 years of consequence for faith and families all across these United States.\nAnd speaking of family, before I go one step further -- you already heard from her, and isn't she something? (Applause.) My wife of 32 years, the Second Lady of the United States of America, Karen Pence. (Applause.)\nKaren and I are deeply grateful that Focus on the Family is going to be honoring this day and our modest presence here by donating an ultrasound in our name to the Life Center in Wabash, Indiana, through the Option Ultrasound Program. You know, Karen and I have spent years supporting the compassionate work of crisis pregnancy centers across Indiana. And, Jim and the whole team here, this donation is deeply meaningful to us and I know it will save innocent lives. Thank you very much. (Applause.)\nYou know, the Bible tells us if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. And I rise today to pay a debt of gratitude on behalf of millions of Americans who have benefited personally and spiritually from the work of this ministry. And as I commend all of you, allow me to acknowledge the founder of this ministry -- a man who became author of an enormous body of work that has inspired millions, and he's been a friend and a mentor to me -- Dr. James Dobson. (Applause.)\nIt's remarkable to think that 40 years ago, Dr. Dobson launched a weekly radio broadcast that aired on a few dozen stations scattered across the country, bringing words of wisdom and encouragement to all who tuned in. Now, you think of his legacy. You know, I spent a little bit of time in talk radio myself back in the day. (Laughter.) I started with a small smattering of radio stations across Indiana -- and it stayed that way. (Laughter.) It's an incredible legacy --(laughter)\n-- and that legacy continues. His, not mine. (Laughter.) It's amazing to think that Focus on the Family broadcast now reaches into the homes and hearts of 38 million people every day. And the programs and publications run by Focus on the Family extend your reach even further -- around the world itself. Give yourself a round of applause for the impact on everyday life. (Applause.)\nIn a very real sense, Focus on the Family has let your light shine before men and women across the world and across this country, touching countless lives and shaping generations. In a very real sense, you're the hands and feet and the voice, in so many ways, of the truths found in the Scriptures -- reaching in with love and compassion, embracing the dignity of people of every background and every experience around the world. You've strengthened marriages -- and I know in my heart you've -- this ministry has saved marriages. You've helped parents train up their children in the way they should go. You've brought the Good News to those who never heard it. You've strengthened the faith and foundation of families.\nAnd, also, you've fearlessly engaged our culture and advocated in the public square for the timeless values that our society needs to hear, now more than ever. I have to tell you, it's especially meaningful for us to be here at Focus on the Family on this occasion because this ministry, and all of you, have been a blessing to millions, including our little family.\nYou know, during my years in Congress, when our three children were young, and now they're all in their 20s -- one is married, one is heading to law school next year, and one is working in the film industry. But when they were real little, every time we took the 600-mile drive from Washington, D.C. back to Indiana, I can promise you we spent an awful lot of time with Connie, Eugene, and Whit at Whit's End. (Applause.) We did. The Adventures in Odyssey were our adventures. (Laughter.) And I remember so often the kids saying, put in another tape. (Laughter.)\nAnd one of the most cherished memories of our children's youth is the Family Nights booklet that we got from Focus on the Family. Literally got that book that we heard about it on the radio or something and called in for it. It inspired us to spend every Friday night with our little ones, usually on the living room floor, a little bit of pizza in the waiting, and we would huddle around a fun story, we'd learn a Biblical message. And that Focus on Family family night booklet is on the shelf with lots of notes from those moments with the little ones.\nSo as we stand here today thanking you for what you've done for families across the country -- when I look at my son, who's married and is a First Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps, when I look at our wonderful daughter, who's walking in faith and working with Christian filmmakers, and when I think of our youngest daughter, who's heading off to law school next year, I just say thank you. Thank you, Focus on the Family, for helping us pour a foundation in our children. (Applause.)\nThe truth is that Focus on the Family has been a force in American families, a force for good for the past 40 years. Millions of families like mine are indebted to your work. And let me assure you that there's one other family that's truly grateful for the work of this great ministry. And I promise you, Focus on the Family, you have an unwavering ally in President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nHe was excited that I was coming here today, and asked me to give all of you his thanks and his regards. And the President has been standing for the things that the people in this room, this ministry has stood for now for four decades. President Trump has stood without apology for the God-given right of every American to live out your convictions in the public square. This President also has stood with those who are persecuted for their faith -- no matter the country they call home or the creed they profess. And President Trump has stood without apology for the most vulnerable in our society -- the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn. (Applause.)\nThis President believes that no American, no American should have to violate their conscience to fully participate in American life, and he has taken action to protect the expressions of faith by men and women across this nation. (Applause.)\nJust last month -- and Steven was there -- I had the great privilege to stand beside the President as he signed an executive order to support religious liberty in our time. Speaking from the Rose Garden, President Trump declared that, in his words now, the \"federal government will never, ever penalize any person for their protected religious beliefs,\" and he directed our Department of Justice to develop new protections for Americans of faith. (Applause.)\nAnd our President is bringing the First Amendment back to pulpits and places of worship around America, rolling back the Johnson Amendment, because the freedom of speech shouldn't stop at the front door of our churches and our synagogues. (Applause.)\nAnd on the world stage President Trump has been standing for our values and our vital national interest. Under President Donald Trump, once again, America is standing with our allies and standing up to our enemies. And speaking of our allies, under President Donald Trump -- if the world knows nothing else the world will know this -- America stands with Israel. (Applause.)\nIt has not just been about liberty at home. This President has stood for religious liberty across the globe. Under President Donald Trump, America has taken measures to condemn persecution of any faith in any place at any time. And protecting and promoting religious freedom is a foreign policy priority of the Trump administration. (Applause.)\nThe heartbreaking truth is that believers of so many backgrounds are under assault across the wider world. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East in the very land where our faith was first given life. Nearly 2,000 years ago the disciples of Jesus Christ fanned out from Israel in every direction, spreading the Good News that we proclaim to this day.\nAll across that ancient land, from the plains of Nineveh where Abraham sojourned, and on the banks of the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the Nile, the fathers of our faith planted seeds of belief blossomed and have borne fruit ever since. But today, these Christian communities face unspeakable atrocities at the hands of radical radical Islamic terrorism.\nThe terrorists seek to stamp out all religions that are not their own, or not even a version of their own, and believers of many backgrounds have suffered grievously -- especially at the hands of the barbarians known as ISIS. That brutal regime shows a savagery unseen in the Middle East since the Middle Ages.\nAt the hands of ISIS, we've witnessed Muslims murdered indiscriminately across the Middle East, and ancient symbols of their culture and faith destroyed. This week alone, ISIS destroyed the 800-year-old Great Mosque at al-Nuri in Mosul.\nBut the practitioners of terror harbor, arguably, a special hatred for the followers of Christ, and I believe ISIS is guilty of nothing short of genocide against people of the Christian faith. In Egypt, we have just recently seen Coptic Christians martyred on their way to a monastery, and bombs explode in churches amidst Palm Sunday celebrations -- a day of hope transformed into a day of grief.\nIn Iraq, we see ancient churches demolished, priests and monks beheaded, and the two-millennia-old Christian tradition in Mosul virtually extinguished. And in Syria, we see Christian communities burned to the ground, women and children sold into human slavery.\nChristianity now faces an exodus in the lands of its birth, unrivaled since the days of Moses. It's heartbreaking to think that the Christian population in Syria has plummeted from one-and-a-quarter million to only 500,000 in just the past six years. And in Iraq, the followers of Christ have fallen by 80 percent in the past decade-and-a-half.\nBe assured of this: This administration is fully committed to bringing relief and comfort to believers in that ancient land. And President Trump has made it clear that America will stand with people of faith in that ancient land in their hour of need. And we will restore -- we will restore their peace and security. (Applause.)\nThis President will continue to stand without apology for persecuted people of faith across the globe. As we speak, we're taking the fight to the terrorists on our terms, on their soil. And we'll not rest, we'll not relent until we drive the cancer of radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the Earth. (Applause.)\nYou know, it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who is so committed to protecting faith and freedom at home and abroad. But I have to tell you, I'm most proud to stand with a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.)\nSince day one of this administration, President Donald Trump has been keeping his promise to defend the unborn. And under this President's leadership and with your support, life is winning in America again.\nLife is winning through the steady advance of science that illuminates when life really begins. Life is winning through the generosity of millions of adoptive families, who open their hearts and their homes to children in need. And life is winning through the compassion of caregivers and volunteers at crisis pregnancy centers and faith-based organizations, like Focus on the Family, that provide and support for women in cities and towns all across the country.\nLife is winning in America, in a word, because of all of you who have supported a President, and a Congress, and the policies that uphold the sanctity of life.\nYou know, this President has been keeping his word since the first day of this administration to stand for the right to life. From the outset of this administration, the President said that he would appoint justices to our Supreme Court and federal judges who would uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution. And he's done that, starting with our newest justice to the Supreme Court of the United States -- Justice Neil Gorsuch. (Applause.)\nIn January, the President actually made some history by personally asking me to be the first official at our level to ever have the privilege to speak at the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C. (Applause.) And the President asked me to go. I said that at the beginning of my speech, Jim, but it really did happen. It was a couple days before that. We were looking at the course of the week, and Prime Minister May was coming to the White House that day. It was going to a busy day. A very important foreign policy discussions. And they were trying to figure out whether the President could make the customary phone call to the March for Life, to break away from those important bilateral discussions.\nAnd I was standing by his desk in the Oval Office, and they were having a hard time figuring out how he could get away. And I said -- you know, rather sheepishly, well, you know, they invited me to speak, too. (Laughter.) And the President looked up at me, and he said, to speak at the March? And I said, yeah. I mean, we -- I said, I've gone before and we've done that before. And he just pointed at me and he said, you should go. (Laughter.) And I went because President Donald Trump wanted me to go and to make a strong stand for the right to life. (Applause.)\nYou know, in fact, beyond that, one of his very first acts in Congress, this President reinstated the Mexico City policy to keep taxpayer funding out of organizations that perform or promote abortions around the world. (Applause.) And he even expanded that policy to cover $9 billion in foreign aid.\nAnd this President has eliminated U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund because American taxpayers should never have to support abortion in China or anywhere else. (Applause.) And the President signed into law legislation that empowered states to withhold funding from abortion providers. And it was my great privilege, at the President's direction, to cast the tie-breaking vote to allow states to defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.)\nAnd later this summer, when we repeal and replace Obamacare, we're going to defund Planned Parenthood once and for all. (Applause.)\nYou know, just yesterday, following important work in the House of Representatives, the United States Senate released its bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. The President and I are grateful to Leader Mitch McConnell and all the Senate Republicans for their deliberative efforts over the past month. And while discussions will continue, let me be clear, the President and I are very supportive of the Senate bill. As the President reminded the nation yesterday, \"Obamacare is dead.\" (Applause.) Obamacare is collapsing all and Obamacare must go.\nThe President and I are counting on your support. We need your energy. We need your enthusiasm, your conviction. We need you to stand up and to speak out, and to work every single day, from this point forward, to get this bill across the finish line.\nThis legislation repeals the taxes and mandates of Obamacare. It gives states all new freedom and flexibility to reform Medicaid to meet the needs of our most vulnerable citizens. And you can be certain, the President and I will be fighting to protect the provisions in this bill that honor the sanctity of life. (Applause.)\nBut this is the moment -- this is the moment, men and women; now is the time. And I can promise you, President Trump and I will not rest and we will not relent until we repeal and replace Obamacare and give the American people the kind of world-class healthcare they deserve, built on freedom, personal responsibility, free market competition, and state-based reform. That's the American way to meet our healthcare needs in the 21st century. (Applause.)\nMen and women of Focus on the Family, I'm here today to say congratulations, but also to urge you to press on. You ought to consider 40 years just a good start. (Laughter.) And I know you do. Yours is and always will be a mission and a ministry of great significance. And I can testify to that and millions of Americans can. For 40 years, you've been a light -- a ray of hope and joy and love into homes across America and around the world.\nSo keep going. Keep doing it. You are testament to the power of unchanging truth to change lives. And in this time of widening challenges and too much division in America, the gentle voice of Focus on the Family -- your values, your support for families -- are more important than ever before. And I believe they spring from the very heart of God.\nFlying out here today, I was reading my morning devotions. And I found myself in the book of Second Kings. I'm not there often, I was just -- (laughter.) I like to read an Old Testament verse and a New Testament verse. And it was when the prophet Elisha asked after a woman who had come to seek some help. Her son had died, and she went running to find the man of God. And as he saw her at a distance, not knowing what had happened in her life, the Bible records that he said words that made me think of all of you. He said, are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?\nThat man of God was not just concerned about her. He was concerned about her family. And so, too, all of you. As you've spoken a word of truth and hope and good news into the lives of individuals, you've done it with a focus on the family. And I thank you for that.\nAnd as I close, and urge you to keep going in this ministry, keep being a blessing to generations to come and other young families on 600-mile drives, let me ask you also to do what the men and women of Focus on the Family have always done, I know, over the past four decades. And that is, as you bow the head and bend the knee in these challenging times, I urge you to pray for America.\nNow, I'm not talking in this moment about praying for a cause or a candidate or an agenda. I rather like what Abraham Lincoln said in his time. He was asked once if he thought that God was on the side of the Union Army. Our 16th President simply replied, \"My concern is not whether God is on our side -- my concern is whether we're on God's side.\"\nSo let's just pray for America. Let's pray for this country that we are so blessed to call home. Because America matters far beyond our shores.\nAnd when you pray, pray with confidence. Because I truly do believe those ancient words that Americans have repaired to time and again in much more challenging times than we face today are every bit as true now as they were millennia ago: That if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, He'll do like He's always done. He'll hear from heaven, and He'll heal this land -- this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\nSo, congratulations, Focus on the Family, on 40 years of ministry. May God bless you. May God bless your families. And may God bless the United States of America.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126531", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you so much. Thank you. How about a big round of applause for General Raymond. He is a remarkable leader. (Applause.) We couldn't be more honored to be here in Colorado with the men and women of Schriever Air Force Base where every day you are evolving the force, driving innovation, and mastering space. Give yourselves a round of applause, would you please. (Applause.)\nI bring greetings this afternoon from your Commander-in-Chief, a champion of the Armed Forces of the United States, the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And I also brought my commander-in-chief with me --(laughter) -- my wife of 32 years, who also is a Marine Corps mom. Would you give a rousing welcome to the Second Lady of the United States, Karen Pence, is with us today. (Applause.)\nMRS. PENCE: I'd like you all to know I was born on McConnell Air Force Base. (Applause.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And we're just delighted to be with all of you today and for the great work at Air Force Space Command. And also I want to congratulate the newest Brigadier General of the United States Air Force -- just announced this morning -- the Commander of the 50th Space Wing, General Deanna Burt. Congratulations, General. (Applause.) And lastly, allow me to just -- this is my first opportunity to do this -- to introduce the President's choice to be the United States Secretary of the Air Force, herself an 11-year veteran of the Air Force. I served with her in the Congress of the United States. She is an incredible advocate of our armed forces, a courageous veteran who has worn the uniform. Join me in welcoming Secretary and Doctor Heather Wilson. (Applause.)\nAnd to all the leadership and all the men and women who serve at Schriever Air Force Base, it's an honor to be with you. The Old Book says if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. And I'm just really here to pay a debt of honor and a debt of gratitude on behalf of the American people for your service to this country. Each and every one of the men and women in this cafeteria have stepped forward in this all-volunteer military that we have to serve our country at an enormously important time. And you here at Space Command in every real sense -- as I'll say more than once -- literally, you might be in Colorado, but you are on the front lines and every day you are in the fight for freedom and the American people are grateful. (Applause.)\nI told the President this morning I was headed your way and he said to me just, \"just tell 'em I'm proud of 'em.\" And I'll tell you what, the President speaks for all of the American people. I can attest to it. The pride the American people place in all the men and women of our armed forces is incalculable and I hope you feel it every single day.\nThis Air Force Base has really exemplified American leadership and American excellence now for more than 30 years. There may not be any runways here, but every day you reach into the stars and you make it possible for your fellow warriors to be able to take the fight to the enemy with enhanced security and enhanced safety. And you guard the nation in space and in cyberspace. You're on the cutting edge of technology and arms and you complete the Air Force's mission. You know, the Air Force's mission -- if I get this right, Heather --is to \"Fly, fight, and win in air, space and cyberspace.\" And you're the last two of that in every sense of the word and we commend you for it.\nYou know, this base is named after a legendary American who wore the uniform, General Bernard Schriever -- the father of the Air Force Space program. And today the more than 7,700 members of the 50th Space Wing operate the space and cyber systems that literally are the envy of the world and keep America one step ahead of all who would do us harm.\nYou direct no fewer than 175 American satellites that are crucial to our national security every day -- in weather, communications, and early warning of foreign missile tests. Every American benefits from your efforts here -- the world's only global utility, the GPS system that's essential to our daily life.\nAnd as the President said in his inaugural address and many times since, space is a priority for this administration and it is a priority for the American people and it will always be. (Applause.) In fact, I'm pleased to report that nearly two decades after it was disbanded, in just a few short weeks the President will soon relaunch the National Space Council. And it will be my great honor as Vice President of the United States to serve as its chairman, which has been a historic role for this office. The President recognizes that America needs a coherent and cohesive approach to the last, greatest frontier in history, and the National Space Council, as it has played a role before, will advise the President on both civilian and military national policy and strategy for space and we look forward to the work of that new entity.\nIt will strengthen opportunities that we have and it will encourage more investment at the national level and more aspiration for all of our people to look to space for careers and for service. And I just want you all to know that this administration is determined to once again ensure that America is leading in space in near Earth orbit and exploration far, far beyond our planet.\nAnd you, the men and women of Schriever Air Force Base, will play a leading role as America leads in space. Under President Trump your mission will be more important than ever before because this administration knows that your work, in the depths of space and cyberspace, is crucial to our security in the 21st century.\nYou know, it really is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, their families, and our veterans. In fact, you'll probably see on the news a little bit later today that not more than a couple of hours ago, President Trump gathered in the East Room at the White House and signed the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act -- comprehensive legislation to provide our veterans with the care they earned in the uniform of the United States and America and we're going to see it through for world-class healthcare for all those who served.\nThis new act, following the Choice Act the President signed into law, is a historic step to hold VA employees accountable to the highest performance standards, it will ensure they're accountable when those standards are not met, and it includes long-overdue protections for VA employees who uncover wrongdoing or blow the whistle on poor care. We all remember those terrible stories. Literally some of our veterans, men and women who have worn the uniform of this country and protected our freedom, who literally struggled with health and some who passed away waiting for care at the VA. I promise you, with this new legislation today and under President Trump's leadership and Secretary Shulkin, the day of bad healthcare at the VA are over. And reform at the VA is coming.\nAnd let me also say -- as I already mentioned before -- as the proud parents of a United States Marine, I couldn't be more grateful to stand with a President who is so committed to rebuilding our military, restoring the arsenal of democracy. And President Donald Trump is fighting every day to make sure that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard have the resources and the training you need to accomplish your mission and bring our soldiers home safe. (Applause.)\nLast month, the President signed a $21 billion increase in funding for the Armed Forces of the United States. It was the largest investment in our military readiness in nearly a decade. In his first budget the Congress will take up this fall, the President called for the biggest increase in military spending since the days of Ronald Reagan -- including a nearly 20 percent increase in the Air Force space budget. We're going to fight to lead in space and we're going to put the resources of the United States of America behind you. (Applause.)\nIn short, the President of the United States is going make the strongest fighting force in history stronger still -- American strength will only grow under the leadership of this new President and this new administration. It doesn't matter whether we're dealing with a brutal regime in North Korea or Iran, or radical Islamic terrorists in Syria, Yemen, or Iraq, the United States will continue to stand strong. We'll continue to take the fight to the enemy on our terms on their soil.\nAnd each one of you are going to continue to be at the tip of the spear, and I understand that, and so does the President. It's one of the reasons I wanted to be here today. It's one of the reasons why I'm told the Secretary of the Air Force has already been here once before in her very short tenure. Because you warriors in the room are playing a central role every hour, every day in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism and the fight for freedom around the world, and we recognize it.\nAs we speak, your brothers-and-sisters-in-arms are stationed across the wider world on the frontiers of freedom in the mountains of South Korea, fields and forests of Eastern Europe, the deserts and valleys of Iraq and Afghanistan; and it's an enormous comfort to them and a great source of confidence that you're here. That your vigilance and your professionalism is here ensuring that they have the real-time information to accomplish their missions.\nYou know those who wear the uniform of the United States, all of you in this room, and all those around our country and around the world are really the bulwark of American freedom. Every day you here at Schriever Air Force Base play your part to defend our freedom, protect the American people, and I want you to know we're grateful each and every day.\nYou know, it's always humbling for me to stand before men and women who are wearing the uniform of the United States because my life did not take me on that path. I didn't wear the uniform. I'm actually the son of a soldier. My father saw combat in the Korean War. And as I mentioned, I'm the proud father of a United States Marine. But maybe it's altogether fitting that someone like me stands before men and women like you just to say thanks. Make sure you know how grateful the American people are each and every day for the service that you provide here and the sacrifice you and your families make to keep our country safe.\nSo let me tell you, I can assure you that you have the support of your Commander-in-Chief and of his number two and of our entire administration. You have the support of the Congress of the United States and the support of the American people that they represent. Let me also assure you one other way -- you also have the prayers of the American people. I know each and every day, there are people across this country who pray for your protection, who pray for your skill and professionalism, and you provide protection and cover over those in harm's way. And they'll continue to carry you, carry you in faith and in prayers as you serve our country.\nSo I came today to say thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your service that creates our freedom at home and our security around the world. And I look out around this room I have faith. I have faith that in the days ahead we will keep America safe. That we'll make it possible for America to prosper. And to borrow a phrase, we'll Make America Great Again.\nThank you for your service, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126530", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:51 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: I want to start with some good news. We continue to see great progress by Congressman Steve Scalise, but additionally, it's great to note that just a few minutes ago George Washington Hospital has announced that Mike Mika, who was also involved in that shooting, has been upgraded to good condition. So we continue to keep an eye on the situation and wish him a speedy recovery on his way to getting out of the hospital. And so that's a great way to start this.\nBack to business here. This morning, after a series of meetings with Secretary of State Tillerson, Homeland Security Secretary Kelly, and Secretary of Defense Mattis, the President was honored to sign the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act surrounded by a group of our nation's great veterans and their brave families.\nAs we all know, the VA scandals exposed unacceptably long wait times for our nation's veterans and issues with tracking their care. In response, Congress passed the Veterans Access Choice and Accountability Act in 2014, which has since brought many more instances of poor performance and misconduct by the VA to light.\nThe bill the President signed this morning further empowers Secretary Shulkin and the VA to protect our veterans from this kind of misconduct in the future. It's one part of the President's comprehensive plan to modernize the VA so that it gives the veterans the care, treatment and support that they so richly deserve.\nBack in March, many of you may remember they signed the Veterans Choice Improvement Act so that more veterans can see the doctor of their choice and they don't have to travel long distances or wait for care. Already under the Choice program, this year, veterans have received 42 percent more approvals to see a doctor that they have chosen. And he signed an executive order in April creating the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection within the VA to hold employees who fail our veterans accountable. At the same time, this office rewards and retains the many VA employees who do a fantastic job and it protects the honest employees who expose wrongdoing.\nAt the signing, he called on Congress to pass legislation then that he signed this morning with Secretary Shulkin to give the authority he needed to best protect those who protect us. Since taking the reins at the VA, Secretary Shulkin has carried through a thorough review to uncover all of the problems and challenges it inherited from the previous administration. He's imposed new standards of accountability and transparency, and just this month he announced that the VA will finally sync up its medical records with the Department of Defense so that veterans will be treated as a single patient across the system, a long-overdue step, giving them the seamless care that they deserve throughout their service and beyond.\nAs he said many times, the President cares deeply about the men and women who have served our country, and he was glad to sign the VA Accountability Act this morning that takes another step toward shaping the VA into a department that is truly worthy of our veterans.\nAlso this morning, the Department of Justice expressed its full support for Texas's efforts towards improving public safety by mandating that statewide -- towards improving -- by mandating statewide cooperation with federal immigration laws that require the removal of illegal immigrants who have committed crimes. The President has made a commitment to keep America safe, and Texas's SB4 law is critical to maintaining cooperation from state and local enforcement partners in that mission.\nThe federal government must have the proper assistance from state and local authorities to effectively enforce immigration laws and keep our communities safe. And that's, frankly, what Texas's law does. Given the strong federal interest in facilitating this cooperation, the Trump administration is glad to be putting its full support behind Texas's effort.\nAs he said yesterday, the President is very supportive of the draft Senate healthcare bill, which represents the next step in repealing and replacing Obamacare. It's time to -- for all Republicans to unite and fulfill this promise that we've been talking about for over seven years, and that we would rescue them from the mess that they -- was created by imposing a risky healthcare experiment on our country several years ago.\nWith costs rising and options dwindling, it's clear that the risk that we were given didn't pay off. Just ask the people of New Hampshire, where another insurer just announced that it will stop offering insurance on the state's Obamacare exchange. The President and his entire team will be looking forward to working with all senators who are willing to come to the table to amend, finalize and pass the bill so that we can deliver a world-class healthcare system in place of the failing system that we have now.\nAnd with that, let's get into some questions. John.\nQ: The President this morning, in an interview with Fox and Friends, seemed to indicate that he thinks that the special counsel may have some conflicts of interest, one being his friendship with Comey; another being the fact that one of the people that he's hiring, bringing on -- special counsel's officer were either Hillary Clinton supporters, and the President said even some of them are -- even worked for Hillary Clinton. Is he still ruling out firing this special counsel?\nMR. SPICER: Nothing has changed on that in terms of his position on it.\nQ: And his position is?\nMR. SPICER: That while he retains the authority -- anyone who serves (inaudible), I believe -- Steve and I had a healthy exchange with -- but that he has no intention of doing that.\nQ: And does -- he seemed to suggest this morning there might be a circumstance under which Mueller should take himself out. Can you tell us --\nMR. SPICER: Yeah, that's one. Obviously, I would refer to Marc Kasowitz in terms of the President's legal strategy on that. But I'll just leave it at that. But good try.\nQ: Sean, on healthcare, what is the President's current outlook on the Senate bill, given some of the reservations that some of the senators raised yesterday? And does the President feel that Senator McConnell should pull the bill next week if he doesn't have the number that -- the numbers to pass it, or is time to vote?\nMR. SPICER: Well, we'll approach that in the same way that we approach the House bill. I'm not going to be -- I wasn't prescriptive then with Speaker Ryan in terms of when they're ready to vote, they'll vote. Senator McConnell has said that he wants a vote next week, and that's up to him to run the chamber the way he sees fit. But the President is very supportive of the bill. He wants to work with all the members to improve it in any way that can help facilitate that passage and make it a stronger bill. And he intends to work with all the individuals -- he's got a lot of respect for the four senators in particular on the Republican side that have come forward -- wants to work with them.\nBut I know Senator Manchin talked about potentially getting some Democrats together, and the President welcomes that.\nQ: Sean, thank you.\nMR. SPICER: Welcome.\nQ: Thank you. What is the President's level of involvement at this point in terms of trying to push the bill forward or not? Can you give us a sense of whether he's taking calls?\nMR. SPICER: He's not -- he's had a couple calls with Majority Leader McConnell. As you'll recall, I think last week we had six senators here. I wouldn't be surprised to see that continued involvement. As you recall, it's a very similar situation as to what it was in the House, right -- that he had several House members come in and out prior to the lead-up of the vote. And as the vote got closer, in working with the whip team in the House and the legislative affairs team here, he identified members that had concerns, or continued to call them.\nI expect a similar process at this point. But he's had meetings with members. He was on the phone with Senator McConnell. But also Secretary Price, Seema Verma, the legislative affairs staff, the chief and staff, and others are intimately engaged in this, having conversations with senators, providing feedback to the President. He's providing guidance back, as far as he'll continue to tweak it. But I think we have a fairly robust discussion going on right now.\nQ: Sean, what is the Vice President's role in the Senate healthcare bill? How involved has he been? And how involved do you see him being going forward?\nMR. SPICER: The Vice President has played a very important role. He's been up there. He goes to the policy lunch once a week. He's constantly on the phone with him. And he's been a huge asset, as he was in the House side.\nBut again, to Maggie's question, I'd say right now it's a fairly similar process. The legislative affairs team is identifying concerns that individual members have, or ideas and suggestions that they have, feeding them back to the team and asking for the President's input, technically, on some of those technical matters, and providing feedback.\nSo as we get closer to that vote, we've been pleasantly surprised with a lot of the support that's already come out, and I think we'll continue to work through, in particular, the four individuals who have expressed some ideas and concerns. And we'll get to it.\nSteve.\nQ: So you're saving the President for the tail-end of the process? Is that what you're saying?\nMR. SPICER: No. I think -- and Maggie can correct me if I'm wrong -- but I think she was asking what the process was. And I think that we're following a similar pattern, which is he has engaged with them. I mean, I think we've talked about the number -- the individuals that he's had over to the White House and met with, and he's also had some pull-asides here and there when they've come over for different things. So he has personally engaged with them.\nThe question about -- Maggie had specifically asked about phone calls. And I think that while he has addressed it here and there, the type of push that you saw at the end of the vote, before the House, we're not at that phase where --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: Yeah. And just because of the nature of -- these are individuals -- I mean, because of the numbers, the Senate being what it is, and the numbers that we have to get to fifty plus one is in a different place than the House, where you had many more members to address.\nQ: When you look at the House bill and the Senate legislation, is the Senate legislation the preferred vehicle for this going forward?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President is very supportive of the Senate bill. There's a lot of ideas in there. He's talked about having heart, and he likes a lot of the reforms that have been in there. He's committed to making sure that no one who currently is in the Medicaid program is affected in any way, which is reflected in the Senate bill, and he's pleased with that.\nSo I think he is very pleased with that bill, and he wants to continue to push it forward. But in the same way, the way he dealt with the House -- I mean, if there's other ideas and amendments as the bill moves forward that would strengthen it, he's all ears.\nAthena.\nQ: And what is the argument he's making, or plans to make, to the senators he's trying to get on board? Is it a policy-focused argument, getting the nitty-gritty? Or is it a larger argument about this being the last best chance, or the best chance to keep a campaign promise?\nMR. SPICER: It's a good question, because I think it depends on the senator and what their concerns are. I mean, if you look at some of the individual senators that have expressed concerns, from Rand Paul to Ted Cruz, there are differences in what their individual concerns are. And so it's not a holistic approach.\nBut I think the overarching point that he's made very consistently is that Obamacare is dead and that it is not a binary choice. It's not \"keep this or take that.\" It's \"this system is failing and we must act.\" That is the overarching point that he's made to all of these individuals.\nOne interesting point is that when you actually look at the House side in particular, you've got 113 members of the Democratic caucus that are co-sponsors of single, universal care, the Bernie Sanders bill. It's a $32 trillion alternative. So if you think about it, the bill that the House -- the House bill that got passed, that's the basis of what the Senate worked off of as a net savings.\nWhat the majority of House Democrats support is not maintaining Obamacare, but the majority of that conference is actually supporting the Bernie Sanders universal healthcare bill, which is a $32 trillion, one-size-fits-all, government-run, no-competition-forces, no-market-forces bill. And I think that that is really what the choice has become.\nIf you think about this, the majority of Democrats in the House aren't backing Obamacare. What they're backing is a government takeover of universal care that doesn't have any market forces and is going to cost our country $32 trillion. And I think that that's the real choice that exists.\nQ: Just in response to tapes, did you see that Congressman Schiff said yesterday something about, 'I don't think we can accept this as a complete answer, referring to the President's tweet. His problem with it was that the President was really talking about him, and that Schiff would like to see, in writing, a response that covers the entire White House. Because the tweet suggested that maybe someone else has recordings. Does the White House plan to deliver some sort of official written response to Schiff in the House Intel Committee?\nMR. SPICER: I believe -- and I have to follow up -- but I believe that there was some communication we have to have by close of business today. So I'll figure out if that's going out. But, I mean, I think the President was clear -- he was asked -- he said he would follow up on whether he knew of this, and I think he's answered it very clearly.\nJanet.\nQ: Just real quick on Medicaid. You mentioned a moment ago something about Medicaid. I want to make sure I'm clear. So is the President comfortable with the changes to the Medicaid program in the Senate bill, and how that would roll back the expansion at a certain date? Is he comfortable with that aspect?\nMR. SPICER: I think right now, as I said, he's very supportive of the current bill.\nQ: And real quick on Qatar. Does the White House have any response to the demands that the Saudis have made of the Qataris?\nMR. SPICER: The four countries that are part of that, we believe it's a family issue and that they should work out. If we can help facilitate those discussions, then so be it. But this is something that they want to and should work out for themselves.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Just following up on Janet's question there. One of those demands would be shut down Al-Jazeera. The United States generally has spoken out in favor of free and independent press -- (inaudible) about Al-Jazeera one way or the other in this case. But does the White House believe that it's appropriate that the free press is something that's on the table for restoration of diplomatic relations?\nMR. SPICER: Again, we're not -- we're willing to play a facilitating role in those discussions. But that's a discussion that those countries need to have amongst themselves.\nAnd so until we're asked to join that and facilitate it, I'm not going to get in the middle of that discussion.\nQ: And second question. In this morning's Washington Post there's an item about some friends of the President inquiring about his health. I'm wondering, is Dr. Jackson of the military office -- of the medical unit, the President's personal physician -- has the President seen him? And will the White House commit to releasing sort of the annual physician's letter that has been customary of presidents for years?\nMR. SPICER: I know Admiral Jackson travels everywhere with the President, so he consults him regularly. I don't have an update on his particular vitals but I will follow up on the letter. But I know that Dr. Jackson -- Admiral Jackson is intimately involved in the President's care and provides him feedback -- whatever medical issues he has.\nAlex.\nQ: Does President Trump think Special Counsel Robert Mueller is partisan?\nMR. SPICER: I think his comments this morning speak for themselves as to his views on Robert Mueller.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two brief questions. First, it was reported on one of the networks that the President referred to the American Healthcare Act as a mean bill and he wanted more money that was coming in. Did he actually say that, or could you confirm or deny whether he used that term to describe it and call for greater funding for parts of it?\nMR. SPICER: I will tell you that I don't comment on private conversations that the President has.\nQ: All right. And the other thing I do want to know was, on Tuesday night, in a public conversation, his speech that he delivered in Cedar Rapids, the President called for legislation that would deny welfare benefits to illegal immigrants for five years. It has been widely reported that that has been on the books for 21 years, going back to when President Clinton signed the omnibus welfare reform legislation in 1996. Was that a misstatement on the President's part, or was he aware that this is already on the books?\nMR. SPICER: The President is aware that that law exists. I think the President's concern generally speaking with all the immigration laws is that they're not being enforced.\nWe've got several laws that are on the books but they're not being enforced. I think the President believes that we need to do what we can -- I mean, obviously, he's been very clear on immigration and on -- especially from our southern border. But that law, while on the books, has not been enforced and clearly either needs to be reexamined, enforced, or new legislation needs to be introduced.\nI'm sorry -- Hallie.\nQ: I have two questions for you. One is a follow-up from earlier in the week. You were asked whether the President believes Russia interfered with the 2016 election, and said you hadn't had a chance to have that conversation. So I'm wondering if you've had that conversation. And if so, if the President is concerned about that interference.\nMR. SPICER: I have. Thank you. And the only point that I would make, just as a point of clarification, he commented I think it was January 5th or 17th, something like that, on that at the time. And he said Russia probably interfered but maybe some other countries did as well.\nQ: He said, \"I think it was Russia but I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.\"\nMR. SPICER: There you go. Thank you.\nQ: And so does he stand by that? Is he concerned about that, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: Of course. He's concerned about any country or any actor that wants to interfere in elections. I confirm that he stands by that.\nBut he's -- and he's taken two I think very large steps. One is cybersecurity, to make sure -- he signed an executive order. His homeland security advisor is working diligently to make sure that we take steps to protect the integrity of our election system and all of our other cyber defenses.\nAnd then secondly, he instituted an election commission that is making sure that we look at all of how we're voting, and to make sure that we maintain integrity in all of our voting process to make sure that we have faith in it. And that includes cyber, it includes voter I.D., it includes all sort of systems. I expect that commission to have several announcements in probably the next two weeks, and potentially some hearings in July.\nBut there's going to be continued activity. But the President takes that very seriously, and I think those two actions in particular point to his commitment to it.\nQ: So to follow up on that then, Sean, what do you say -- we've talked to dozens of state officials who say they simply have not heard much from this administration regarding how to protect their own voting systems. What do you say to those critics who say you're not doing enough?\nMR. SPICER: I think those official -- state and county, and I think down to the municipal level -- will get a letter next week from the commission asking them to help facilitate some transfer of data back to us so we can begin the process of a thorough review of the systems. And we will continue to engage them and find out ways that we can strengthen the integrity of our system and make sure that we have the utmost confidence in our voting system.\nBlake.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. The front row gets an A for effort. Let's see how the back row (inaudible).\nMR. SPICER: All right. You have a lot to live up to. (Laughter.)\nQ: This question is on healthcare. Obviously, the House bill and the Senate draft discussion, they're similar but they're different. Does the President at this point have a preference to either one? And if so, which one?\nMR. SPICER: I think right now he's, as I mentioned, very supportive of the Senate bill. Let's get that passed, and then, obviously, we'll go to conference. And so there's elements of the Senate bill that he's very pleased with, but let's -- our goal is to work through the process, get it passed through the Senate, and then have that discussion in conference.\nQ: And let me ask you -- comments that you made this morning. You talked about -- you were asked about the strategy and you talked about how several high-level people within the administration have been provided technical assistance, working with members and Senate leadership to ask -- or to talk, rather, about additional changes that might be necessary. I'm curious as to what those -- specifically what those additional changes in the Senate bill that you view might indeed be necessary.\nI think you've got four Republican senators in particular that have expressed -- each one of them has concerns, and in order to get over 50 votes we're going to -- we'll listen to them and to others that will help strengthen the bill and get us to that point. But that's -- part of that -- that's part of the process. Same thing that we did in the House side too.\nQ: So nothing specific from the White House point of view as far as --\nMR. SPICER: Well, I don't want to -- I mean, again, this is a discussion that we'll have with those senators, but I'm not going to telegraph it right now. As I mentioned -- correctly quoting me from earlier this morning -- that we're going to have those conversations with them, find out what additions, suggestions, ideas they have that strengthen the bill and help it move forward.\nQ: Real quick wanted to follow up on healthcare. Is the President eager enough to get rid of Obamacare that he would accept a bill that he doesn't like? Or if he doesn't get what he wants out of the Senate and/or out of conference, would he veto it and make them go back to the drawing board?\nMR. SPICER: Well, of course -- in theory, if he doesn't like something, he's not going to sign it. As I've said, he's very supportive of the Senate bill as it stands. So I don't think that's going to be a problem.\nQ: And the follow-up to that is there are four members of the Republican Party who say that the problem with it is that it's really too much like Obamacare and they want to see it completely jettisoned.\nMR. SPICER: That's not entirely accurate.\nQ: Well, all right, I'm paraphrasing --\nMR. SPICER: Again, he'll work with them and our staff will work with them, and we'll look at issues that can get us there. But I think -- you know, and I mentioned Senator Manchin himself also noted that he would like to sit down and work, and I think if we can find -- if we can grow that number even larger, he would love to do it.\nQ: Will he sit with Democrats?\nMR. SPICER: Senator Manchin is a Democrat.\nQ: I mean, other than --\nMR. SPICER: He mentioned that he might have some additional folks that have expressed to him a willingness to work together. And I think the President has been clear, if anybody has a willingness to move this forward and get it done, he'd love to be -- work across party lines.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. We saw the President's tweet about China's role in the North Korea crisis. He just met with Mattis and Tillerson, who met with their Chinese counterparts yesterday. He characterized at this point what he thinks about China's role in North Korea and whether he's preparing to impose what are called secondary sanction on Chinese entities that are flouting international sanctions.\nMR. SPICER: I will not comment on the second part of that for obvious reasons, but good try.\nLook, he remains hopeful that we can work with China, both politically and economically, to apply the pressure on North Korea. He commented personally, and I'll reiterate, that he continues to be very troubled by what happened to Otto Warmbier and would like to see China do more.\nQ: So you're not hopeful -- I'm sorry. He's hopeful, he's not impatient at this point? He hasn't lost patience with China?\nMR. SPICER: I just would say that he remains hopeful that we can find a way forward.\nQ: Sean, on the --\nMR. SPICER: Steve.\nQ: I want to ask you about Russia, because this week the Russians cancelled planned talks in St. Petersburg. It's been widely reported that two weeks from now, in Germany, the President and Vladimir Putin are supposed to have some kind of talk on the sidelines of the G20. Is it the President's intention to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Germany?\nMR. SPICER: Obviously, Steve, we have a lot of countries that we will probably have bilaterals with on the sidelines of the G20, as well as during the visit to Poland. Not -- that wouldn't happen during that, but there are countries that we are planning bilats with both during the stop in Poland as well as during the two days that we'll be at the G20.\nQ: Does the President want to meet with Vladimir Putin?\nMR. SPICER: I think that he understands that we have a role -- to the extent that we can work with Russia to solve some problems and to cooperate, if we can find that willingness that we'd like to do it. And when we have an update on the schedule as we grow closer to the G20, I'm sure we'll provide that to you.\nQ: How would you describe the current state of American-Russian relations?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know what word you're -- I mean, they have -- we maintain a -- I'll give you a good example. We continue to have de-confliction with them in Syria. I think that's a positive thing. I think we enjoy normal diplomatic relations with them. And, as the President has said very -- on numerous times that if we can find areas of agreement with Russia, especially with respect to the fight against ISIS, safe zones in Syria, then we'll do it. But it's got to be on terms that are in the best interest -- in our national interest.\nJohn Decker.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. When the President tweeted out earlier this week that China's efforts at applying pressure on North Korea, in his words, has not worked out, was he referring to the idea that China has not applied the necessary pressure on North Korea, or that North Korea has received that pressure and it has specifically not responded to whatever pressure China has applied?\nMR. SPICER: I will just say that, as I mentioned to Olivier, he remains hopeful that they will continue to apply additional pressure that will seek a better outcome in terms of North Korea. But I'll leave that tweet for itself and continue discussion through diplomatic channels.\nQ: So when he seemed to sort of abandon the idea of getting China to apply that pressure to North Korea, at the same time it's -- let me just finish -- at the same time, it seems as if Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson are going to continue that effort. Is there a conflict there in terms of what the President wants to perhaps not do and what the Secretaries of Defense and State want to do in applying that pressure to North Korea through China?\nMR. SPICER: So can you just expand on that, just to --\nQ: Well, it seems like the President has given up on trying to get China to apply pressure --\nMR. SPICER: No, I don't think that's true. As, I mean, I mentioned, he remains hopeful that they will apply both diplomatic, political and economic pressure to force North Korea to do the right thing.\nQ: Sean, two questions for you. One, just on the tapes, in an interview this morning, the President said he believes his tweet about the tapes influenced Comey to tell the truth in his testimony. So two-pronged question here. Is his position now that Comey was truthful in that testimony? And is he conceding that he used Twitter in a way he believes to change the behavior of a congressional witness?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not going to comment any further than the comments that he made this morning.\nQ: Separately -- on a separate topic. On the briefings, you said Monday about your decision to hold these off-camera briefings, off-audio briefings, \"There are days that I'll decide that the President's voice should be the one that speaks, and iterate his priorities.\" Today the President spoke, so did you this morning -- had an interview with Fox News. What's the reasoning for not answering questions on camera today?\nMR. SPICER: The President gave lengthy remarks today on camera, spoke about the VA bill. Hope you carried it.\nQ: You spoke on camera, too, earlier.\nMR. SPICER: I know, I did. See how much on-camera there is? I mean, look, I think -- as I said, you referenced the comments I made on Monday; I made the same comments -- similar comments in December and January. And some days we'll do it. I think it's great for us to come out here and have a substantive discussion about policies.\nI don't think that the be all and end all is whether it's on television or not. We've made ourselves available a lot of times and will continue to do. But I'd rather sit here and have a very enjoyable conversation with you on issues on a Friday afternoon, and let the President's comments stand on the great things that he's doing on behalf of our nation's veterans.\nAlex.\nQ: A follow-up on the tapes. You were also on Fox this morning --\nMR. SPICER: I was. Thank you for watching.\nQ: Yeah. But you indicated that the President's tweet on the tapes successfully influenced Comey to tell the truth in his testimony. So do you believe that he lied about -- is it the White House's position that he still lied about the President pressuring him to end the Flynn investigation? Is that still the White House position?\nMR. SPICER: I believe that the President's remarks on Fox and Friends this morning reflect the President's position.\nQ: So that would mean that he believes that Comey told the truth.\nMR. SPICER: I don't think I need to do any further analysis than what the President himself said the intention was.\nYes.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. I have two questions, if I may. First is about -- during yesterday's meeting between President Trump and the Chinese State Councilor, Yang Jiechi, President Trump expressed his interest in joining Belt and Road Initiative. Could you tell us more about their meeting?\nMR. SPICER: I can't. I mean, obviously I think we sent a representative to that conference, but I'm not going to get any further than the discussion that they had.\nQ: So we heard that Jared and Ivanka have accepted an invitation to visit China by the end of this year. Could you comment on that, as well?\nMR. SPICER: They have.\nQ: Take one question, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: I know because Goyal has got a visit coming on Monday, so he gets a question on Friday.\nQ: Thank you, sir. Two questions.\nMR. SPICER: Are you excited?\nQ: This will be the first face-to-face meeting --\nMR. SPICER: It will.\nQ: Yes, sir. This will be the first --\nMR. SPICER: Better get ready.\nQ: -- face-to-face meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi. So is President Trump ready to accept him and welcome him, because both have the same dream? Prime Minister Modi is saying \"Make in India,\" and President Trump is saying \"Buy American,\" and make in America -- or \"Hire American.\" So my question is, so much is there on the plate when Prime Minister Modi arrives here. He's saying that he will have a great meeting with the President because we have many things in common, as far as U.S.-India relations are concerned. So what can we expect between the two leaders?\nMR. SPICER: Well, first, I want to wish the people of India a happy 70th anniversary on their independence.\nBut during the meeting, the President and the Prime Minister will discuss ongoing cooperation, including counterterrorism, defense partnership in the Indo-Pacific region, global cooperation, burden-sharing, trade, law enforcement, and energy. I think it's going to be a very robust discussion.\nQ: And a separate question, please --\nMR. SPICER: Yeah.\nQ: Thank you. On Wednesday, June 21st was the International Day of Yoga, which was declared by the United Nations three years ago under the leadership -- initiative by Prime Minister Mode. Any citation you think President Trump will issue? Or what he has -- any message as far as yoga is concerned? Because yoga means less trips to the doctors and hospitals.\nMR. SPICER: I don't have -- (laughter) -- anything on yoga at this point. But I appreciate the --\nQ: Show us a stance. (Laughter.)\nMR. SPICER: Trey.\nQ: Thank you. I have two questions -- one on North Korea and one on healthcare. Starting with healthcare, does the President consider the Senate bill a full repeal of Obamacare? The four senators you talked about, they say that they don't feel it's a full repeal, which is why they're not supporting the current draft.\nMR. SPICER: Obamacare is -- I mean, I think I've said it before -- Obamacare is dead. So it is -- you have no carriers, the premiums are skyrocketing. So whatever you want to call it, the bottom line is, it is a dead healthcare system. There isn't a question about whether or not -- what to do with it. We have to act. I think the President has made clear that we need to actually get a system in place.\nQ: On North Korea, the government of North Korea said that Otto Warmbier's death is a mystery to them. How does the White House respond to these comments?\nMR. SPICER: I don't think it's a mystery. I think we know very well what happened. And I think, as the President said, it's a disgrace.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sean, I had a couple questions. First, on healthcare. The order in which the Senate was going to vote will occur after the CBO score, and the White House was very critical of the Congressional Budget Office back in March, during the House process. So my question is, does the President believe that his discussions with lawmakers about what they want and their concern about the legislation should be guided by the CBO score? And will it influence his thinking as he looks at the bill?\nMR. SPICER: I think one of the points that I made last time, Alexis -- which stands -- is that the CBO core function is budgetary and fiscal impacts, not on people. And they've been wildly off by a huge percentage when they've tried to score people. Their track record on doing that is not good. And so we maintain what we have all along: we want to do the right policy. And the CBO score should be used by members in the Senate to decide -- to the extent that they think that that helps them make a decision. But I think we all understand -- look, Obamacare promised it was going to drive premiums down $2,500, it was going to bring down deductibles. It did none of that stuff.\nI think the way that this bill has been constructed has done so in a way that it's actually going to achieve the goals that the American people were promised.\nAll the way in the back.\nQ: Can I just follow up on another topic?\nMR. SPICER: Of course.\nQ: Hallie was asking about Russia and the interview. I just wanted to ask you, because you were just commenting that the President does believe Russia was behind the interference in the election, that he is concerned, that the administration is taking steps. So to follow up on her question and Steve's question -- is it the President's desire to speak directly to Putin, if he gets that chance, to say that U.S. officials believe that Russia poses a risk to the 2018 and 2020 elections, and the United States would like Russia to be on notice or on warning that the United States disapproves of this?\nMR. SPICER: If and when there's a meeting, we will have a readout for you.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. There's a play rendition of Julius Caesar in New York City where the character portrayed as President Trump gets assassinated. Is the President aware of this play? And if so, what's his reaction? And also, is the Secret Service investigating it?\nMR. SPICER: That's a question for the Secret Service. You can call Kathy over there and ask her.\nLook, I think it's troubling whether it's that or Johnny Depp's comments. We've seen this. And, frankly, as far as I'm concerned, I know that the President and the First Lady weighed in on Kathy Griffin's comments. I don't know that he's aware about the play in particular that's going on there. But it is, frankly, my belief, a little troubling the lack of outrage that we've seen in some of these instances where people have said what they've said with respect to the President and the actions that should be taken.\nThe President has made it clear that we should denounce violence in all of its forms. And I think that if we're going to hold to that standard, then we should all agree that that standard should be universally called out. And so when those actions are depicted -- and I think we saw a couple folks in the media and some other places tweet out their support for that show -- I'm not sure that that's a smart thing to do. We either all agree that violence should be called out and denounced, or not. And I think that it's concerning when you see a pattern that these comments get made, these actions get depicted, and the lack of attention that they get when it's on our side.\nQ: Sean, thank you. With regard to the bill signing from this morning, do you see this as a -- because the President talked a lot about during (inaudible) federal employees and so forth. Do you see this as maybe a larger point of going through civil service reform, and which you could look at holding career-level federal employees to higher standards, and making it easier to fire certain people for certain conduct?\nMR. SPICER: I think it's a good start, yeah. This is the first step. I think it's important that we start with our veterans. But I think everyone who serves in the public trust has an obligation to serve the public and do what they can, whether it's our veterans or people looking for an education loan or whatever. And if you're not doing your job, I think that we should, as a government, have a standard that if you're not doing what the job is supposed to be doing, and you're not helping your fellow Americans achieve what that department or agency is after, that we should make sure that there's a process by which we can have that person removed and put in place somebody who will do it.\nThe President's step this morning was a big step forward. And I think to your question, the impact of that, the signal that it sends isn't just about veterans, obviously, but it is -- it should resonate government-wide that we expect people who serve in government to do what they can to serve our country.\nQ: You mentioned veterans would be a good start. What would be the next step? I mean, would it be the (inaudible) misconduct?\nMR. SPICER: We'll wait and see. I think we've got a fairly robust legislative agenda right now, but if the House and the Senate wanted to move forward with something else, I'm sure we could find a way to work with them.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. The Carrier plant the President visited right after the election has told employees that it would lay off more than 600 people between now and the end of the year. Its employment would actually fall below the agreement that it has with the state. Would the President reengage in that situation? Should the state claw back some of those incentives?\nMR. SPICER: We're talking about 632 jobs in this instance. This was announced last year, so what we're hearing now is nothing new. Carrier remains committed to retaining 1,069 Hoosier jobs over the next 10 years, consistent with the deal that was reached after the election. By maintaining these jobs in Indiana, Carrier is showing confidence in the business climate and the future of the American economy.\nQ: So in terms of the deals that the White House is making with individual companies, though, earlier this week you addressed Ford and you said, \"At some point in the future, tax reform is what would incentivize companies to operate here.\" But what sort of enforcement mechanisms does the White House have to keep these companies honest?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, remember, that deal that you're talking about with Carrier is consistent with the deal that they struck. This is just the manifestation of the deal that was struck back in, I think it was November of last year; it could have been early December.\nSo this is consistent with what they said they would do back then, but I think both in terms of regulatory policy and tax policy, we need to do what we can to incentivize more companies to not just stay here, but to grow here.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two separate policy topics. First of all, you said that Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, is going to be looking at potentially getting some Democratic votes for the Senate healthcare bill. The President has said repeatedly that no matter how good this bill is, that he doesn't think that he would get any Democratic votes for it. It now sounds like you're saying that you do expect potentially to get some Democratic votes for it, and therefore you might not even need these four Republican senators who say that they can't support it.\nMR. SPICER: I didn't say that.\nQ: Okay.\nMR. SPICER: But what I said -- and just to be clear -- is it's obviously -- the President believes, and for good reason -- I don't think that -- he doesn't believe that we'll end up getting any. I think it's encouraging that, as we evolve through this process, that you see someone like Senator Manchin say, I agree that the system is broken and I'm willing to fix it.\nNow, whether or not we ultimately can get his vote, that's another question. But I think it's encouraging that someone like him wants to step forward and engage in a discussion about -- if there's a potential of getting his vote. And obviously that's a discussion that -- whether it's him or someone else -- I noted the other day, I think, to Hallie that a couple of times already, Senator Schumer has been very clear that there would be no engagement from Democrats.\nSo to see this progress I think is -- I don't want to get too far in front of it, but it's also -- it's good to see at least one senator publicly say that they're willing to have that discussion.\nJordan.\nQ: Sorry -- I said two policy questions, sorry.\nMR. SPICER: You did.\nQ: Totally separate subject, I wanted to follow up on what John Gizzi had asked about the --\nMR. SPICER: That's a first. (Laughter.)\nQ: Follow up on what John Gizzi had said about the President's speech on Tuesday night and the welfare requirement for immigrants. What specifically would the proposal that the President was talking about do that's different than what is already a part of the federal law? You said he wanted to reexamine it, maybe even put in a new law. What was he proposing? How is that different?\nMR. SPICER: Well, when we have an announcement on that, I'll let you know.\nQ: You said he'd be he putting in legislation soon.\nMR. SPICER: I understand that. And so when we do, we'll let you know. But at this point, we don't have that.\nJordan.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. If he White House is concerned about the message of Julius Caesar and stuff that's said by Johnny Depp, then why was Al Baldasaro, who said that Hillary Clinton should be shot for treason for the handling of Benghazi, invited to the VA event today at the White House?\nMR. SPICER: Well, obviously, as I mentioned, we also -- I'd make it very clear, I don't -- I condemn all acts of violence. I don't believe that any -- and the President has said this as well -- that anybody who goes out and tries to highlight those kind of actions should not be welcome. I don't -- I'm not aware of the comments he made.\nBut again, I'll say it right now, that I don't think that we should be resorting to that kind of language with respect to anybody in our country.\nQ: You mean you do condemn it.\nQ: You do condemn it.\nMR. SPICER: I do. Thank you.\nQ: Let me ask you about -- one on Russia, one on healthcare. The Russia sanctions bill -- can you talk at all about what your goals are for that bill, even a sense of timing? Is it helpful to have that bill sooner or later from this White House?\nMR. SPICER: You mean the one that the Senate passed that is -- got pulled back with the -- I mean, that's -- right now -- the Senate passed the bill, the parliamentarian rule that it had a revenue component to it and it had to have originated in the House. So now the House is looking at it.\nBut right now, I mean, there's not a -- there's nothing to comment on in the sense that the Senate parliamentarian rule that because of the revenue nature --\nQ: What (inaudible) opinion on whether --\nMR. SPICER: Well, I mean, let's see what it looks like. I think obviously the concern that we will have is whether or not the executive maintains the authority and the flexibility with respect to implementing sanctions both going forward to pulling back to effectively achieve a goal.\nAnd so --\nQ: It's not a timing issue for you guys.\nMR. SPICER: No, I think it's a policy -- it's -- how it's crafted. And I think that's something that we're going to look at as it -- assuming that the House takes up its legislation, and then when it goes to the Senate. But I think our main concern overall with sanctions is how they -- how the Congress crafts them, and any potential erosion of the executive branch's authority to implement them.\nQ: And just real quick, these contested Obamacare payments --\nMR. SPICER: The CSRs.\nQ: -- that the administration looked through this month, the President has referred to those as \"ransom.\" Is there any reason to believe that those will -- won't keep -- won't be approved every month until there's a change to the healthcare law?\nMR. SPICER: I think we committed to making them last month, and that's as far as we will go at this time. We're not committing to them this month. Obviously --\nQ: Why is it a month-to-month thing to you guys?\nMR. SPICER: Because I think that the question is, if we believe -- again, I'm not going to -- last month, obviously, if we can pass healthcare overall then that changes that. And part of it is going to be where we are in that process. But it ultimately -- up to the President to decide. But the reason it's a month-to-month is because exactly what you said, he doesn't -- the court has ruled very clearly on this instance.\nQ: Can you say why he decided to make -- authorize these payments?\nMR. SPICER: Because again, part of it is -- our goal is to ultimately transition to a healthcare system that doesn't need them and isn't a bailout to the insurance companies. So we want to get to that system as quick as possible. And our hope is that that transition can take place.\nQ: It seems like a -- to threaten these payments on a month-to-month basis, does this risk the President's --\nMR. SPICER: It's not a -- there's no threat. It's just a fact. As soon as we can get it done, it's in the best interest of a healthcare system, it's in the best interest of the American taxpayer. And as soon as the President decides that we either have a system or he doesn't want to continue the bailout, then we'll stop. But it wouldn't make --\nQ: So (inaudible).\nMR. SPICER: I don't think -- look, I'll give you the flip side. If the President were to hypothetically say that he's going to make the payments in perpetuity or for a year, I think that continues to prop up a failed system. It continues to do wrong by the American taxpayer. And it also doesn't lend itself to the expediency that I think we want to -- help get a new healthcare system in place.\nThank you guys very much.\nEND 2:36 P.M.

Traveling throughout our country over the last 2 years, I have met so many of these wonderful Americans, and I have never forgotten their stories.\nIn Wisconsin, I recently met a proud Veteran and his wife, Michael and Tammy Kushman. When they were forced onto Obamacare and the exchange in 2015, they thought they would be able to keep their doctor, but they couldn't. They thought they would be able to keep their plan, but they weren't allowed. They were told their premiums would go down, but instead, they soared by 120 percent upward. It was one Obamacare lie after another. Today, the Kushmans spend $1,400 dollars a month on health insurance, nearly one-fourth of their entire net monthly income.\nOn the same visit, I met another family, Robert and Sarah Stoll. Robert is a volunteer captain for his local fire department. After their Obamacare premiums nearly doubled, they needed extra money, and Sarah had no choice but to leave retirement to pay their bills. But this new income meant, they were no longer eligible for the tax credit they had once received, and the Federal Government actually forced them to repay thousands and thousands of dollars.\nThese families and so many others are victims of a catastrophic law that is wreaking havoc on our health care system and our families. Democrats in Congress created this calamity, and now, if we don't act, millions more Americans will be hurt by Obamacare's deepening death spiral.\nAmericans were promised lower premiums, more choices, and better access. Instead, premiums have doubled nationwide, and insurers are still fleeing the market that Obamacare has nearly destroyed. Americans in nearly one-third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges, and many markets may soon have no insurers at all. It really is a disaster.\nThe American people are calling out for relief, and my administration is determined to provide it. And we are working with Congress to get a bill to my desk so we can rescue Americans from this catastrophe. As families across the Nation continue to suffer under this law, I only hope that Democrats in Congress will have the political courage to help fix what we know to be a catastrophic situation—a total disaster—that they have created. To be part of the solution, instead of obstructing—always obstructing—change, blocking reform, and doubling down on Obamacare's failure.\nBut no matter what, my administration will never stop fighting for you and for the health care system that you deserve. We'll get it done. Even if we don't have any help from the Democrats, we'll get it done.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.", "timestamp": "2017-06-23", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Thank you very much, everybody. That's really greatly appreciated.\nAnd thank you to Secretary Shulkin for that introduction and for your really tireless efforts, David, to protect those who have really been protecting all of us for so long. These are great, great people. And you know who I'm talking about, right? Congratulations.\nIn just a short time, we've already achieved transformative change at the VA, and believe me, we're just getting started. We have so many people that have been so helpful right here in the room and Tom and all my friends. It's been fantastic. The enthusiasm for the Veterans Administration and for making it right for our great veterans has been incredible. And I want to thank all of them.\nOne of my greatest honors and joys during the Presidential campaign was the time I spent going all across the country with our Nation's really and truly incredible veterans. In their courage, their dignity, and their selfless sacrifice, they represent the very best of us. Our veterans have fulfilled their duty to this Nation, and now we must fulfill our duty to them.\nSo to every veteran who is here with us today, I just want to say two very simple words: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You are the warriors and heroes who have won our freedom, and we will never forget what you have done for all of us, ever.\nAs you all know all too well, for many years, the Government failed to keep its promises to our veterans. We all remember the nightmare that veterans suffered during the VA scandals that were exposed a few years ago. Veterans were put on secret wait lists, given the wrong medication, given the bad treatments, and ignored in moments of crisis for them. Many veterans died waiting for a simple doctor's appointment. What happened was a national disgrace.\nAnd yet some of the employees involved in these scandals remained on the payrolls. Outdated laws kept the Government from holding those who failed our veterans accountable. Today we are finally changing those laws—it wasn't easy, but we did have some fantastic help—to make sure that the scandal of what we suffered so recently never, ever happens again and that our veterans can get the care they so richly deserve.\nSo you just heard from Sergeant Michael Verardo. Great. I didn't get to shake your hand, Michael. Huh? Get up, Michael. He gets up better than I do. [Laughter] Thank you, Michael.\nMichael lost two limbs in defending our country, and yet he had to wait 57 days to get his prosthetic leg repaired—that's a long time, Michael—and over 3½ years for modifications to make his house more accessible. What happened to Michael is happening to many, but it's rarely happening under our leadership and David's leadership anymore. That I can tell you.\nOur wounded warriors have given everything they have to this Nation, and we owe them everything we have in return. And we're taking care of it. Today we are taking a very historic action to transform the VA by enacting the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. This was not easy. This was not an easy one. And it's one that they wanted to do—Michael, you know—for a long time. For many years, couldn't get it done. We got it done.\nThis is one of the largest reforms to the VA in its history. It's a reform that I campaigned on, and now I am thrilled to be able to sign that promise into law. VA accountability is essential to making sure that our veterans are treated with the respect they have so richly earned through their blood, sweat, and tears. This law will finally give the VA Secretary—who is, by the way, just doing some job, and he's doing it with this and with the heart, believe me.\nIt gives the Secretary the authority to remove Federal employees who fail and endanger our veterans and to do so quickly and effectively. It's been a long time since you've heard those words. Those entrusted with the sacred duty of serving our veterans will be held accountable for the care they provide. It's a big statement.\nAt the same time, this bill protects whistleblowers who do the right thing. We want to reward, cherish, and promote the many dedicated employees at the VA. This legislation also gives the VA Secretary the authority to appoint new Medical Directors at VA hospitals—something which was almost impossible to do in the past. And these are going to be talented, talented people.\nI applaud Chairman Phil Roe and the Members of Congress here with us today—which we have many—who fought so hard for this legislation. And I want them up here when I sign. And I just want to thank the Members of Congress. They have been really dedicated to getting this done. It was not easy for them either. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.\nAnd our very sincere gratitude as well to the veteran service organizations who have joined us for this tremendous occasion and for everything they do for the veterans and for so long. They've been fighting for this and other things so long. And by the way, other things are happening. We've done a lot. This is a big one. We have a lot of good ones coming.\nI also want to express our appreciation for Secretary Shulkin, who is implementing the dramatic reform throughout the VA. It's got to be implemented. If it's not properly implemented, it will never mean the same thing. But I have no doubt it will be properly implemented. Right, David?\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs David J. Shulkin. Absolutely.\nThe President. It'd better be, David.\n[At this point, the President gestured with his finger in mock anger and mouthed the words \"You're fired.\"]\nOh, we'll never have to use those words. [Laughter] We'll never have to use those words on our David. [Laughter] We will never use those words on you, that's for sure. [Laughter]\nThat one never fails, does it, Tom? [Laughter]\nSince my first day in office, we've taken one action after another to ensure our veterans—and make sure, we have to make sure—that they get world-class care and the kind of care that they've been promised by so many different people for so many years. We've created a new Office of Accountability at the VA, which will empower—and really has been empowered—by this legislation. We've launched a new website that publishes wait times at every VA hospital. We've delivered same-day mental health service at all 168 VA medical centers. That's a big operation when you think of it. We've announced that the VA will finally solve a problem that has plagued our Government for decades: seamlessly transferring veterans' medical records from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veteran Affairs.\nNow, that doesn't sound like such a big deal. It is, believe me. That was a big one. We thought this would be easy, but the people, like David and all that have been here and understand the system, he said that's going to be a tough one. We got it done. So that was a good one. But it is something we're very proud to have been able to do it this quickly.\nI've also signed the Veterans Choice Improvement Act so that more veterans can see the doctor of their choice. Already this year, using the Choice Program, veterans have received nearly double the number of approvals to see the doctor of their choosing.\nAnd this is only the beginning. We will not rest until the job is 100 percent complete for our great veterans. [Applause] Thank you. We can all be inspired by the story of a retired Air Force veteran, named Earl Morse, who served as a physician's assistant at the VA centers in Ohio and Indiana.\nThirteen years ago, Earl began asking his patients if they planned to visit new World War II Memorial—which is beautiful—right here in Washington, DC. Nearly all said they planned to visit. But when he saw these patients at their next appointment, almost none of them had made the trip.\nOne day, he had an idea. Earl is a private pilot. He asked one of his patients, who was a World War II veteran, if he could fly with him to the memorial. He was so honored to do it. The 80-year-old veteran wept, openly cried. He never imagined he would see that beautiful monument to his service. That is how first Honor Flight was born. Honor Flight, it's a very beautiful thing.\nSince then, over 100,000 veterans have been greeted with cheers of gratitude as they arrive in our Nation's Capital. We want all of American veterans—all of them, every one of them—to experience and to at least have the opportunity to experience that same gratitude every time they walk into the VA.\nThat's what today is all about: keeping our promises to those who have kept us free, kept us happy, saved our lives, and saved our families.\nSo I just want to thank you, our incredible veterans. We stand with you. We salute you. And with this new legislation, we strive to better support and serve you every single day.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless our veterans. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Come on up, folks.\nSecretary Shulkin. That was great.\n[The President moved to the signing desk.]\nThe President. So this is something that we are all very proud to be signing. It's a tremendous honor for me. It's a tremendous honor for everybody on stage. And we're taking care of our veterans, and we're taking care of them properly.\nSo this is something that we are all very proud to be signing. It's a tremendous honor for me; it's a tremendous honor for everybody on stage. And we're taking care of our veterans, and we're taking care of them properly. Thank you. David, congratulations. Thank you again. Michael, congratulations. Secretary Shulkin. And that's Sarah.\nThe President. Nice to see you.\n[The President signed the bill.]\nOkay. Phil, Tom, and everybody, who should get this pen?\nParticipant. Michael.\nThe President. I have a feeling it's Michael. What do you think? Right?\nSecretary Shulkin. Absolutely, absolutely. Definitely.\n[The President handed the pen to Army veteran Michael Verardo and shook his hand.]\nThe President. We're going to get some others for you all.", "timestamp": "2017-06-23", "title": "Remarks on Signing the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017"}

This history of inaccuracy, as demonstrated by its flawed report on coverage, premiums, and predicted deficit arising out of Obamacare, reminds us that its analysis must not be trusted blindly. In 2013, the CBO estimated that 24 million people would have coverage under Obamacare by 2016. It was off by an astounding 13 million people – more than half—as less than 11 million were actually covered. Then, CBO estimated that 30 million fewer people would be uninsured in 2016, but then it had to reduce its estimate to 22 million, further illustrating its inability to present reliable healthcare predictions.\nWe know the facts.

Above all, these objectives include combatting terrorist threats, promoting stability across the Indo-Pacific region, increasing free and fair trade, and strengthening energy linkages. President Trump and Prime Minister Modi expressed confidence that, together, the United States and India will provide strong leadership to address global challenges and build prosperity for their citizens in the decades to come.\nDemocratic Stalwarts in the Indo-Pacific Region\nAs responsible stewards in the Indo-Pacific region, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi agreed that a close partnership between the United States and India is central to peace and stability in the region. Recognizing the significant progress achieved in these endeavors, the leaders agreed to take further measures to strengthen their partnership. In accordance with the tenets outlined in the U.N. Charter, they committed to a set of common principles for the region, according to which sovereignty and international law are respected and every country can prosper. To this end, the leaders:\n* reiterate the importance of respecting freedom of navigation, overflight, and commerce throughout the region;\n* call upon all nations to resolve territorial and maritime disputes peacefully and in accordance with international law;\n* support bolstering regional economic connectivity through the transparent development of infrastructure and the use of responsible debt financing practices, while ensuring respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the rule of law, and the environment; and\n* call on other nations in the region to adhere to these principles.\nPresident Trump welcomed further Indian contributions to promote Afghanistan's democracy, stability, prosperity, and security. Recognizing the importance of their respective strategic partnerships with Afghanistan, the leaders committed to continue close consultations and cooperation in support of Afghanistan's future.\nIn accord with India's Think West policy, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi resolved to increase cooperation, enhance diplomatic consultations, and increase tangible collaboration with partners in the Middle East.\nThe leaders strongly condemned continued provocations by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), emphasizing that its destabilizing pursuit of nuclear and ballistic missile programs poses a grave threat to regional security and global peace. The leaders called on DPRK to strictly abide by its international obligations and commitments. The leaders pledged to work together to counter the DPRK's weapons of mass destruction programs, including by holding accountable all parties that support these programs.\nShoulder-to-Shoulder Against Terrorism\nThe Leaders stressed that terrorism is a global scourge that must be fought and terrorist safe havens rooted out in every part of the world. They resolved that India and the United States will fight together against this grave challenge to humanity. They committed to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from groups including Al-Qa'ida, ISIS, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, D-Company, and their affiliates. India appreciated the United States designation of the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen leader as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist as evidence of the commitment of the United States to end terror in all its forms. In this spirit, the leaders welcomed a new consultation mechanism on domestic and international terrorist designations listing proposals.\nThe leaders called on Pakistan to ensure that its territory is not used to launch terrorist attacks on other countries. They further called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai, Pathankot, and other cross-border terrorist attacks perpetrated by Pakistan-based groups.\nThe leaders announced increased cooperation to prevent terrorist travel and to disrupt global recruitment efforts by expanding intelligence-sharing and operational-level counterterrorism cooperation. They welcomed commencement of the exchange of information on known and suspected terrorists for travel screening. They further resolved to strengthen information exchange on plans, movements and linkages of terrorist groups and their leaders, as well as on raising and moving of funds by terrorist groups.\nThe leaders also affirmed their support for a U.N. Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that will advance and strengthen the framework for global cooperation and reinforce the message that no cause or grievance justifies terrorism. They also pledged to work together to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems and to deny access to such weapons by terrorists and non-state actors.\nGrowing Strategic Convergence\nPresident Trump and Prime Minister Modi pledged to deepen defense and security cooperation, building on the United States' recognition of India as a Major Defense Partner. The United States and India look forward to working together on advanced defense equipment and technology at a level commensurate with that of the closest allies and partners of the United States. Reflecting the partnership, the United States has offered for India's consideration the sale of Sea Guardian Unmanned Aerial Systems, which would enhance India's capabilities and promote shared security interests.\nResolving to expand their maritime security cooperation, the leaders announced their intention to build on the implementation of their \"White Shipping\" data sharing arrangement, which enhances collaboration on maritime domain awareness. President Trump welcomed Prime Minister Modi's strong support for the United States to join as an Observer in the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium. Noting the importance of the upcoming MALABAR naval exercise, the leaders determined to expand their engagements on shared maritime objectives and to explore new exercises.\nAs global nonproliferation partners, the United States expressed strong support for India's early membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Wassenaar Arrangement, and the Australia Group. President Trump reaffirmed the support of the United States for India's permanent membership on a reformed U.N. Security Council.\nIncreasing Free and Fair Trade\nThe leaders committed that the United States and India -- leading engines of growth in the global economy -- should intensify their economic cooperation to make their nations stronger and their citizens more prosperous. Noting that extensive economic and tax reforms launched in their respective countries will unlock immense economic opportunities for both countries, the leaders committed to further expanding and balancing the trade relationship and to removing obstacles to growth and jobs creation. They also resolved to pursue increased commercial engagement in a manner that advances the principles of free and fair trade. To this end, the United States and India plan to undertake a comprehensive review of trade relations with the goal of expediting regulatory processes; ensuring that technology and innovation are appropriately fostered, valued, and protected; and increasing market access in areas such as agriculture, information technology, and manufactured goods and services. President Trump and Prime Minister Modi further committed to strengthening cooperation to address excess capacity in industrial sectors. They called on their teams to find creative ways to improve bilateral trade.\nSurveying United States-India energy ties and the two countries' respective energy strategies, the leaders affirmed the continued importance of their Strategic Energy Partnership and of leveraging new opportunities to elevate cooperation to enhance global energy security. The leaders called for a rational approach that balances environment and climate policy, global economic development, and energy security needs.\nPresident Trump affirmed that the United States continues to remove barriers to energy development and investment in the United States and to U.S. energy exports so that more natural gas, clean coal, and renewable resources and technologies are available to fuel India's economic growth and inclusive development. Prime Minister Modi and President Trump looked forward to conclusion of contractual agreements between Westinghouse Electric Company and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India for six nuclear reactors in India and also related project financing. Both leaders welcomed upcoming visits between India and the United States that will expand energy and innovation linkages across the energy sector and deepen cooperation, including on more efficient fossil fuel technologies, smart grids, and energy storage. They supported financing of energy projects, including clean coal projects, by Multilateral Development Banks to promote universal access to affordable and reliable energy.\nRecognizing that we are in an increasingly digital world, the leaders agreed to intensify the mutually beneficial partnership to fully harness their innovation capabilities to solve global developmental challenges. As global partners, the United States and India resolved to further strengthen their collaboration in health, space, oceans, and other areas of science and technology. The leaders also agreed to strengthen their cooperation to address the growing threats and challenges from malicious cyber activity and committed to work together to promote an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable cyberspace environment that supports innovation, economic growth, and commerce.\nApplauding the entrepreneurship and innovation of Indians and Indian-Americans that have directly benefitted both nations, President Trump welcomed India's formal entry into the International Expedited Traveler Initiative (Global Entry program) in order to facilitate closer business and educational ties between the citizens of India and the United States.\nPresident Trump gladly accepted Prime Minister Modi's invitation to visit India. They look forward to working together in a spirit of friendship in the years to come.", "timestamp": "2017-06-26", "title": "Joint Statement - United States and India: Prosperity Through Partnership"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126614", "text": "President Donald Trump hosted Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House on June 26, 2017. The visit reinforced the close ties between the United States and India that have strengthened both great democracies. Highlights of this cooperation include:\nGlobal Partners on Defense and Security\n* Major Defense Partner. The United States remains a reliable provider of advanced defense articles in support of India's military modernization efforts. United States-sourced defense articles, including the Sea Guardian Unmanned Aerial System, Apache attack helicopters, and C-17 aircraft will further enhance the capabilities of the Indian Armed Forces and provide additional opportunities for interoperability. Completion of these sales would increase bilateral defense trade to nearly $19 billion, supporting thousands of United States jobs. If selected, United State offers to sell F-16 and F/A-18 fighter aircraft to India would represent the most significant defense cooperation between the United States and India to date.\n* DTTI. The United States-India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) remains the premier forum for deepening collaboration on defense co-development and co-production. The seven DTTI Joint Working Groups continue to discuss a range of technologies and platforms for potential co-development, including India's participation in the Future Vertical Lift program. DTTI representatives met most recently in April 2017.\n* Military-Military Engagements. Key military and civilian defense leaders continue to meet via reciprocal counterpart visits and strategic and policy dialogues, promoting closer service ties and improving interoperability among our forces. The annual MALABAR naval exercise, occurring in July 2017 in the Indian Ocean, will be the most complex to date, including participants from the U.S. Navy, Indian Navy, and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. The United States and India also participate in the VAJRA PRAHAR Special Forces exercise, the RED FLAG air force exercise, and YUDH ABHYAS army exercise.\n* Counter-Terrorism Partnership. The United States and India are committed to combatting terrorism in all its forms and to strengthening cooperation on terrorist screening, intelligence, and information sharing, terrorist use of the internet, and multilateral terrorist designations. Reflecting this partnership, the U.S. Terrorist Screening Center and Indian counterparts are cross-screening known and suspected terrorists for investigative and intelligence purposes.\n* Law Enforcement Cooperation. The United States has provided anti-terrorism assistance training for more than 1,200 Indian security personnel since 2008.\n* Facilitating Strategic Trade. The High Technology Cooperation Group (HTCG) facilitates greater civil high technology and defense trade between American and Indian businesses, leveraging India's status as a Major Defense Partner. In 1999, 24 percent of all exports from the United States to India required an export license. Currently, licensed exports still make up only a small percentage of trade with India; in 2016, only 0.4 percent required a license, commensurate with the United States' closest allies and partners.\nCommitted to Increasing Free and Fair Trade\n* Trade. Two-way trade in goods and services reached $114 billion in 2016. With the Indian economy growing at 7 percent annually, both countries are committed to further expanding and balancing the trade relationship.\n* Aviation. In 2017, Indian airline SpiceJet announced the order of 100 new Boeing 737MAX-8s, bringing its order to 205 planes valued at more than $20 billion and, according to industry, creating and sustaining 130,000 American jobs in the state of Washington and elsewhere. At the Paris Air Show in June, SpiceJet announced a preliminary commitment for an additional 20 Boeing aircraft.\n* India is projected to become the world's third-largest commercial aviation market by 2020. Through the U.S-India Aviation Cooperation Program, the United States has increased the safety and security of India's rapidly growing aviation sector, and generated over $600 million in exports of U.S. manufactured goods and services.\n* Trade Facilitation. The United States and India, both signatories to the World Trade Organization's Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), are working together to implement the TFA's provisions and help lower the cost of trade for both our countries.\n* Investment. According to the Government of India, the United States is one of the top five destinations for investment from India. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reports that Indian companies have invested over $11 billion in the United States economy, creating and sustaining more than 52,000 jobs. Industry sources indicate these investments are spread across 35 states.\n* Capital Markets. The Department of Treasury and Indian Ministry of Finance continue to collaborate on resolving outstanding tax disputes, building Indian capital markets, and promoting greater bilateral investment. Enhanced technical cooperation includes areas such as the development of India's municipal bond market. The just-completed issuance of a municipal bond for the city of Pune was India's first municipal issuance since 2011.\nPowering the New India\n* Liquefied Natural Gas Exports and Investment. Indian energy companies have signed more than $30 billion in long-term contracts for U.S.-produced liquefied natural gas (LNG), including from Louisiana and Maryland. Industry estimates that Indian companies have invested more than $10 billion in the United States LNG and shale sectors.\n* Nuclear Power. The United States and India are committed to realizing commercial civil nuclear cooperation, in particular through a contract for six Westinghouse Electric AP-1000 nuclear reactors to be built in Andhra Pradesh, India. Once completed, the project will provide reliable electricity for millions of Indian citizens.\n* Fossil Energy. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency will host a Refineries Performance Optimization Reverse Trade Mission in fall 2017, familiarizing senior executives from Indian refining companies with U.S. technologies that can optimize the performance of India's oil refineries.\n* Grid Expansion and Modernization. The Department of Commerce will lead a Smart Grid and Energy Storage Business Development Mission to New Delhi, Hyderabad, and Mumbai in March 2018 to showcase U.S. technologies and services that can help India address its grid modernization needs. The two countries also announced the Smart Grid and Energy Storage consortia under the U.S.-India Joint Clean Energy and Research Development Center.\n* Energy Finance. The U.S.-India Clean Energy Finance Task Force is delivering recommendations to mobilize U.S. technology exports and American and Indian private investment in India's $1.2 trillion power market. Additionally, the Department of State is facilitating connections between American and Indian industry, state governments, and universities to advance energy solutions.\nExpanding Ties Between Our Citizens\n* Today, nearly 4 million Indian-Americans reside in the United States and over 700,000 U.S. citizens live in India. Last year, the United States Government issued nearly one million visas to Indian citizens, and facilitated 1.7 million visits by Indian citizens to the United States.\n* Global Entry Trusted Traveler Program. The United States began accepting applications from India for the expedited entry program, facilitating travel in both directions that will lead to more business, investment, and tourism. In 2016, Indian visitors in the United States spent nearly $13 billion, making India the sixth largest market for U.S. travel and tourism exports.\n* Skills Development. More than 166,000 Indian students studied in the United States in 2016, contributing $5 billion in economic activity and supporting some 64,000 American jobs. Over the last decade, Indian students contributed $31 billion to the U.S. economy.\n* Entrepreneurship. The United States and India will co-host a Global Entrepreneurship Summit this year in India, focused on supporting women entrepreneurs, and geared toward solving 21st century challenges and improving lives. President Trump has asked Ivanka Trump to lead the United States delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit.\n* Indian Americans have embraced innovation and entrepreneurship, sitting at the forefront of Silicon Valley's technology revolution, and founding an estimated 15 percent of Silicon Valley startups. They have helped to develop the Pentium chip, fiber optics, and noise canceling headphones, among numerous other innovations.\nTackling Global Challenges\n* Exploring Space. The United States and India are working together in the exploration of space, from discovering water on the surface of the Moon to sharing data on Mars from our respective orbiters. The joint NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite, scheduled for launch in 2021, will help scientists to better understand some of Earth's most complex systems and hazards.\n* Afghanistan Development. The United States and India support increased stability and prosperity in Afghanistan and their expanded development coordination and cooperation benefits all three countries. India has spent $2 billion on development assistance to Afghanistan since 2001, and pledged an additional $1 billion in 2016. In September 2017, the United States will co-sponsor the India-Afghanistan Export, Trade and Investment Fair in New Delhi, to promote expanded Afghan commercial ties with India.\n* Global Agriculture Cooperation. Fifty years after the Green Revolution helped India to free millions from hunger, the United States and India have trained more than 1,500 agricultural practitioners from 17 countries across Africa and Asia on specialized farming practices to improve productivity and income.\n* U.N. Peacekeeping Burden Sharing. India and the United States remain committed to U.N. peacekeeping and building the capacity of African partners, training participants from 13 countries and the African Union. The two sides will conduct additional joint training in July 2017 and lead a mobile training team in Africa this fall.\n* Disease Research and Treatment. For more than 40 years, the United States has collaborated with India on disease research, including tuberculosis (TB), HIV, and rotavirus, and non-communicable diseases – cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. The United States supports India's ambitious goal to end TB by 2025, through the scale-up of detection, diagnosis, and new treatments for drug-resistant TB.\n* Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). As GHSA Steering Group members, the United States and India recognize the importance of strengthening global capacity to counter infectious disease threats. India is working across sectors to address antimicrobial resistance (AMR) stewardship, a key threat to global health security and modern medicine. The United States remains committed to supporting India as it develops and implements multi-sectoral national action plans to combat AMR and two national AMR networks for the use of antimicrobial surveillance.", "timestamp": "2017-06-26", "title": "Press Release - Fact Sheet: The United States and India — Prosperity Through Partnership"}
{"author": "Sean Spicer", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126580", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:47 P.M. EDT\nMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. I want to say at the top that with respect to the Supreme Court decision on the President's executive order, the President was honored by the 9-0 decision that allows him to use an important tool to protect our nation's homeland.\nHis number-one responsibility as Commander-in-Chief is to keep the American people safe, and that's exactly what this executive order does.\nIn terms of next steps, the government is reviewing the decision and determining how to proceed going forward. The decision obviously just came down a few hours ago, so we'll probably have further guidance for you as it becomes available. In the meantime, I would suggest you reach out to the Department of Justice as they -- as details become available.\nThe Supreme Court also today handed down its own decision in the Trinity Lutheran case. That was a 7-2 decision, which is a significant victory for religious liberty and an affirmation of the First Amendment right of all Americans.\nThe Court recognized there's a clear difference between the government supporting a particular religion and the government simply treating all people the same -- fairly -- regardless of their religion.\nThis ruling reaffirms that the government cannot discriminate against individuals or organizations simply because they or their members hold religious beliefs. The President believes that America is stronger when people of faith and their organizations can exercise their religion freely, and he's pleased with today's ruling.\nIn terms of the rest of the schedule this week, it's going to be extremely busy and action-packed leading up to the July 4th weekend, and the President's subsequent trip to Poland and the G20.\nThis week we're going to wrap up a month-long focus on American jobs with a week dedicated to American energy. President Trump is committed to utilizing our abundant domestic energy resources both to create jobs here at home and to strengthen America's global influence and leadership abroad.\nToday, energy is going to be a key topic of discussion when the President meets with the Prime Minister of India, including how important our strategic energy partnership and how American energy will help fuel India's growth and development.\nIn addition to their statements in the Rose Garden, we're adding a pool spray at the top of their dinners this evening. And later this week we'll have an important announcement on the President's agenda in terms of how it will help establish American energy dominance.\nOf course, it's also a big week for healthcare with an anticipated vote in the Senate later this week on the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. The Trump administration is holding events around the country highlighting the failure of Obamacare and what that failure has cost American families. From the 6.5 million Americans who paid a penalty to the IRS instead of buying an unaffordable product that didn't meet their needs, to the people in states like Utah, where Secretary Price is today, and where premiums have increased an average of $1,900 since 2013.\nThe Secretary has a great op-ed in the Deseret News today that I would encourage you all to take a look at.\nAfter a small-business roundtable in Utah with some of those who have been shouldering the burden of Obamacare for both themselves and their employees, Secretary Price will travel to Texas and participate in another listening session with physicians in Dallas.\nIn Washington today, the Vice President and Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Administrator Seema Verma will be hosting a listening session here at the White House focused on the adverse effects of Obamacare on families and individuals with disabilities. Many of the participants include families who support children with disabilities, as well as those who have been left with no choice when insurers fled their states' Obamacare exchanges.\nAccording to recent reports, roughly 41 percent of counties could have only one insurer on the exchanges next year, which is up from roughly about 33 percent with one insurer this year. And there will be 47 counties as of now that have no insurer on the exchange at all.\nWashington has been ignoring the struggles of families for these -- like these for too long. And the faster that we can repeal and replace Obamacare, the faster that we can ensure that they and the millions of other Americans who are paying the real price of this failed law get the help that they need.\nHealthcare is making a lot of the headlines on the Hill and in Congress, but there's also important work being moved forward in fulfilling the promise to crack down on sanctuary cities. The House is expected to vote on two bills towards the end of this week which are major priorities of the President.\nThe first -- the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act -- would prevent states and localities that refuse to follow federal law and cooperate with immigration authorities from receiving certain grants from both the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. Those funds would instead be granted to states and localities that are in compliance with federal law.\nAnd the second is Kate's Law, which is named in honor of Kate Steinle, which would increase the mandatory penalties for aliens who illegally reenter the United States with stronger penalty increases for those who have been previously convicted of a crime. This is an issue that should unite all Americans in both major parties.\nOver 80 percent of the American people support this common-sense, mainstream approach. These measures also represent an essential tool in the fight to dismantle the dangerous MS-13 cartel, and is widely supported by law enforcement.\nWe fully expect these bills to move through Congress and look forward to the President signing them both.\nWith that, I'm glad to take a few questions.\nKristen.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Over the weekend, in an interview on Fox, President Trump seemed to acknowledge that he does believe that Russia interfered in the U.S. election. Is that how that statement should be interpreted? Does he believe that Russia interfered in the election?\nMR. SPICER: The statement that he made in January is consistent with what he said the other day, which is that he believes that Russia probably was involved; potentially some other countries, as well, could have been equally involved -- or could have been involved -- not equally. And he stands by the statements that he made in January.\nQ: And just a quick follow-up. Over the past 48 hours, he's really been hitting his predecessor hard for not doing enough to respond to that. So what is he doing? Or what does he intend to do different?\nMR. SPICER: Well, there's two aspects to that question. One is, if you believe the story that was written, that means from August through November 8th, two things: One, that if you believe that, then they did know about this. And there's some serious questions about what they did or did not do in terms of acting. And the second is, I think it's then pretty clear that they knew all along that there was no collusion. And that's very helpful for the President.\nBut as to the point of what he's doing, that continues to be what I mentioned the other day. He signed an executive order on cybersecurity to strengthen our ability to combat anybody from interfering not just in our elections but in a lot of our key infrastructure, cyber infrastructure.\nAnd secondly, he's got a commission that will continue to have more activities this month looking holistically at the election process to make sure that we're taking all the steps to protect the integrity of our voting systems.\nSteve.\nQ: The President tweeted that his predecessor did nothing in response to this Russian meddling. Curious what you think that Barack Obama should have done.\nMR. SPICER: I don't -- I think, you know, it's not just the President. I think Congressman Adam Schiff, a ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, expressed very similar concern with what wasn't done.\nObviously, I don't have all the understanding of what they knew and when they knew it, but there does seem to be a bit of hypocrisy in terms of what they didn't clearly do if they truly believed all of this was happening.\nBut as I mentioned to Kristen just a second ago, I think what's also important to note is that, if they did know all this, then they clearly do know that there was no collusion.\nQ: At the time, though, what I'm sure a lot of us remember, in August and September and October of last year, the President was saying -- Mr. Trump was saying, \"I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest. We're running against a rigged system.\"\nOn October 19th, at the debate, he was asked by Chris Wallace, \"Will you absolutely accept the result of this election?\" And he refused to say. Is there any reason to think that Barack Obama, given all of that, should have done more? Does the President believe that, given what Mr. Trump was saying at the time, that Barack Obama didn't do enough and may have choked -- I guess was the way to put it?\nMR. SPICER: I think the President addressed that in the tweet, Steve. Obviously, he does think he should have done more if he knew all of this.\nAgain, I don't -- I have not asked him what additional steps. I think his tweet made it clear that he does believe, if you believe the story, that he should have.\nBlake.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about the Supreme Court decision today. They said that anybody that has a bona fide relationship with another person or another entity is still permitted. So in a way it limited the initial -- or the second executive order. So I'm curious if the administration feels that what is now permitted by the Supreme Court does indeed protect the homeland.\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I think it's a positive step forward. As I mentioned at the outset, the Department of Justice in particular is reviewing this in terms of both its implementation and its impact. So I don't want to get too far ahead of all of these brilliant legal minds as they review the impact. But I think -- as I noted, I think the President feels very, very pleased with the 9-0 decision.\nQ: And let me ask you about healthcare. John Cornyn said over the weekend that August 1st is the real drop-dead deadline. Does the White House see it that way, as well?\nMR. SPICER: You mean for final passage?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. SPICER: I think we'd like to see whenever they leave for their August break -- their August recess -- it done by then. So I don't have at the tip of my fingertips when they plan to leave town, but whenever that date is, whether it's August 1st or 2nd or 3rd or whatever.\nQ: What was President's involvement over the weekend? How would you characterize that?\nMR. SPICER: He made several calls to multiple senators to hear their concerns and get their ideas, and understand where they're at and what needs to get done.\nEamon.\nQ: Does the President still see this version of the travel ban as \"watered down\" and \"politically correct\"?\nMR. SPICER: Again -- well, remember, they're looking at the totality of it. So I think part of it, as I mentioned to Blake a second ago, will be dependent on what the lawyers believe its impact will be in terms of how it goes forward and what we can do. So I'm going to punt on that for a moment and let the lawyers take a look at that and give an update.\nQ: And is he still critical of the way the Department of Justice has handled the rollout of it?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think, like I said, right now we're just pleased with what the Supreme Court has done. And once we have a better idea of its full impact, we'll be able to have a better analysis of that.\nJennifer.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. Can you characterize how the President thinks the Kushner-Greenblatt meetings went in Israel? And specifically, is there any truth to reports out of Israel that relations are strained between the U.S. and the Palestinians due to these demands that they stop sending payments to terrorists?\nMR. SPICER: Well, first, I think the meetings were extremely productive. They're going to make incremental movements forward, but it's going to be a process. It's not going to get solved in a night. And I think they made some good progress overall, and also continuing to build trust between all the parties.\nIt's no secret, I know, that when President Abbas was here, we discussed the payments as an issue then, and so it should be no surprise it came up. But I would argue that the relationship continues to be very strong and move forward in a positive way.\nMara.\nQ: Sean, thank you. On several occasions the President has suggested he wanted the Senate bill improved. He said he was looking forward to making it really special and he said, in Iowa, put more money into it, make it more generous, it should have heart. Does he believe that the Senate has done that, or is he looking for more improvements in the bill?\nMR. SPICER: He's very pleased with the developments that have come. He's been impressed with the work. He, obviously, as you mentioned, he wants a bill that has heart. He wants a bill that does what it's supposed to do. When you look at what happened with Obamacare, he wants to make sure we think through this. As I mentioned to Blake, he had several calls over the weekend hearing ideas and opinions about how to strengthen it, and he'll continue to support ways to make the bill stronger.\nQ: But are his criteria still that we should, as you said in the past, cover everyone with lower premiums and lower deductibles?\nMR. SPICER: Sure.\nQ: So that's his bar and --\nMR. SPICER: Well there's a lot. I mean, obviously he wants to make sure that people have access and that it's affordable. So coverage is obviously key. But as I've mentioned multiple times here before, when you have a card and no coverage, that's not good. It doesn't get you the care that you need and it doesn't do so within means that you can afford. So we're going to continue to figure out a way to make that work.\nJen.\nQ: Sean. Sean. Can you answer whether the President still believes --\nQ: The reports out of Israel --\nMR. SPICER: There's no camera on, Jim.\nQ: Maybe we should turn the cameras on, Sean. Why don't we turn the cameras on? Why don't we turn the cameras on?\nMR. SPICER: Jen, I'm sorry that you have to --\nQ: Why not turn the cameras on, Sean? They're in the room, the lights are on.\nQ: Is it not true that there were tensions and some strain between the U.S. negotiators which were Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt and the Palestinians? Is it not true that there were tensions on this trip?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not aware of any, no.\nQ: Okay, so none?\nMR. SPICER: When I talked to them about the trip, it was very positive. I'm not aware of any. I know that there was one story -- I believe that story has been updated that came out of there, but I know that that's been updated.\nQ: The President said two weeks ago that he would have press conference in two weeks on ISIS --\nMR. SPICER: As soon as I have an update on that, I'll let you know.\nQ: And then the antitrust out of the European Union. They're expected to levy a fine against Google for over $1 billion. Do you have any reaction?\nMR. SPICER: I don't, not yet.\nOlivier.\nQ: Can we have cameras -- can the President hold a press conference, Sean? Sean.\nQ: Senator Corker says he will use his authority as Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman to block arms sales to Saudi and Qatar until that crisis is resolved. Is that a constructive step in your view?\nMR. SPICER: I think we share Senator Corker's goal on two fronts. One, obviously we want to resolve this situation. I know that the states that are involved are viewing this as a family matter, and Secretary Tillerson is helping to facilitate some of that. We believe that's positive. We share that concern, and we also share the concern about terror financing that Senator Corker has, and I think we can work together on both of those goals.\nQ: And one more for you. In one of your answers on the Russia meddling you said other countries were either equally involved or involved.\nMR. SPICER: Yeah.\nQ: What other countries?\nMR. SPICER: The statement that the President gave -- and I don't have it off the top of my head -- in January said, I believe Russia was probably involved and there could be -- I think he said -- an there could be others as well. Whatever that statement was.\nQ: Are you guys talking about an intelligence finding? Is that just a hypothetical? I don't understand where that --\nMR. SPICER: Again, it's the same statement that he's had since January.\nAlex.\nQ: Will President Trump rely on that previous list of potential conservatives for Supreme Court justices for future picks?\nMR. SPICER: What's that?\nQ: Will President Trump rely on that previous list of 21 potential Supreme Court justices for future picks?\nMR. SPICER: I'm sure that that will definitely be a strong part of it. I can't say that there won't be someone added on or not, but it proved to be a very helpful list the first time. So he feels very comfortable about the list but I can't say for certain that there's no one that couldn't get added to a future list.\nZeke.\nQ: Earlier, in your response to the Russia question, you used the conditional \"if this story is true.\" I was hoping you could provide some clarity on whether or not the President believes this is an accurate statement. Has he been briefed on that on what President Obama knew, and also given that he was briefed along that same timetable by the intelligence community.\nAnd then separately on that, does the President have a response or any retaliatory measures if he believes Russia was behind this?\nMR. SPICER: In terms of -- I'm sorry. I'm just trying to figure out what part --\nQ: I'm asking, does the President believe that Russia was involved in an attempt to influence the 2016 election? And then, if so, what is he going to do in response to Russia's doing it?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think I mentioned this to Kristen and I'll say it again. He's answered this questions since January that he said Russia is probably involved in this. And then, secondly he's been taking steps to --\nQ: No, he hasn't said that since January, Sean. He hasn't.\nMR. SPICER: He's taken steps to ensure that our cybersecurity network --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SPICER: Well, I'm not going to get into specific details, but I will just say that he's taken steps on both of those fronts and on the election.\nQ: And just a separate question. Yesterday, in Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu reversed on a deal to create a third -- a gender-neutral space on the Western Wall. And a number of American Jewish leaders are blasting the Israeli Prime Minister. Does the White House -- has there been any contact on this sensitive issue? And does that the White House take any position on that?\nMR. SPICER: I don't have anything for you on that right now. I would probably refer you to the State Department.\nAnita.\nQ: I have a couple questions about the Supreme Court decision. I don't really understand the practicality of it. I understand they're going to take it up in the fall. But one is, do you still need a 90-day review now or is that -- has that 90 days has already passed? And secondly, in the fall when they take it up, I think the Court also addressed, won't the point be moot by then? I mean, you'll have a number of months to implement this and have the review process. So what's the point?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I'm going to let the Department of Justice fully analyze this. But obviously, there's certain things that were enjoined when both the 4th and the 9th Circuits issued their opinions on this. And I think part of what the Department of Justice, among some of the other agencies that are involved, have to look at --\nQ: Do you know when they'll get back to us? Like what timing -- days?\nMR. SPICER: The decision is hours old.\nQ: Okay.\nMR. SPICER: Hopefully sooner rather than later.\nQ: Quick question about today. They'll be delivering statements in the Rose Garden this afternoon. I'm just wondering why that ended up being statements and not -- the last couple times that the Prime Minister came, for whatever reason President Obama and the Prime Minister did not have statements, nor did they take questions. Today you have statements, no questions. Whose decision was that? Did the Prime Minister not want questions?\nMR. SPICER: I'm going to just say, we obviously -- on each visit there are discussions at the diplomatic level back and forth about what will go into that visit, what issues will be discussed. All of those kind of things get worked out by the two teams, and I'll leave it at that.\nGlenn.\nQ: Two quick questions. First, back to the Russia thing since I know you never tire talking about it. One of the things in the President's tweets that I've noticed is that he doesn't reference the conclusion that the intelligence agencies have made -- that Russia intervened on his behalf, or perhaps, to put a finer point on it, against Hillary Clinton. Does the President accept that aspect of what the intelligence agencies have said?\nMR. SPICER: Honestly, I've never asked him that specific question. I'd be glad to follow up.\nQ: And the second thing is, just to dig the hole a little bit deeper on his comments in January. Have you ever discussed with him -- he has said this in debates, he's talked about 400-pound kids sitting on edges of beds. Can we cite anything -- or if you can't provide it today, can you provide it in a subsequent briefing -- that gives us some sense that other countries may have been involved in this other than Russia?\nMR. SPICER: I'll try. Yeah, look, to the extent that it's not classified, I can at least ask the intelligence communities for an update on that.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sean. Do you happen to know if the White House has made any progress with those five Republican senators who have already stated they're opposed to the Senate healthcare bill?\nMR. SPICER: I can tell you, as I mentioned, that the President talked extensively with several Republican members over the weekend, and he felt very positive about those discussions. But they're ongoing.\nQ: Can you tell us who they were?\nQ: And were those phone calls with those particular individuals?\nMR. SPICER: I know -- for example, I know that he's talked to Senator Cruz. He's talked to Senator Paul. I believe he's talked to Senator Capito, Senator Johnson. I don't have the extent -- but I know those individuals in particular, and I think several others.\nQ: And then one thing that you mentioned at the top in your statement and the President also put in his tweet, you mentioned that the Supreme Court ruling, which came out today, as it relates to the travel ban, was unanimous -- 9-0. Where are you getting that particular number from? Because it was a per curiam ruling by the Supreme Court, meaning we don't know the actual breakdown of the Court in voting for this particular decision.\nMR. SPICER: I'd have to -- I'm going to get back with counsel and ask them. That was on them. So I'll find out where they got that from. Maybe they've got --\nJim.\nMR. SPICER: Sean, thank you. Could you walk me through what Secretary Kelly is going to do to immediately implement the travel ban now that parts of it have been restored?\nMR. SPICER: No. As I mentioned -- I mean, this is -- first and foremost, the Department of Justice needs to review the ruling, and then they're going to coordinate with both DHS and other federal government departments and agencies to figure out how to implement that going forward.\nCharlie.\nQ: The San Diego Tribune reported that the prototypes for the President's wall has been delayed. Is that true?\nMR. SPICER: I'm not aware that that's true. I would contact DHS on that one. They're the lead on that.\nQ: So the wall is going ahead as scheduled?\nMR. SPICER: Nothing that I understand -- I know that there are pieces of it. DHS has been actively involved in both repairing, working on some new sections. So, you know, you could check with DHS, but my understanding is it's been -- the work to repair sections that needed to be repaired is being done. And then there's some new sections that they're actually already starting on. So I'm not aware of any delays that may or may not exist.\nQ: Did you guys get the prototype?\nMR. SPICER: Again, all that would be a DHS issue.\nKristen.\nQ: Thank you. When asked about what actions President Trump might take against Russia in retaliation for meddling in the election, you cited the cybersecurity executive order. Can you be more specific, though? Does he support, for example, the new bill for a fresh round of sanctions against Russia?\nMR. SPICER: Well, the new bill that the Senate parliamentarian rule didn't follow proper procedure. So, I mean, there is no new bill at this time. The House is looking at taking up legislation.\nQ: Would you support a new round of sanctions?\nMR. SPICER: Depends on -- let's see what the bill looks like. I'm not going to comment on a hypothetical.\nQ: Does he support some type of punitive action directed at Russia specifically?\nMR. SPICER: I do know, when it comes to how the President works, he doesn't telegraph what he's going to do on a lot of these things. He does a lot of quiet diplomacy, he enacts things, and so until we're ready to announce something, we're not going to telegraph it through here.\nQ: And can you clarify what he meant in his tweet? He accused former President Obama of colluding or obstructing. What evidence does he have?\nMR. SPICER: I think -- again, what I will just leave it at is that clearly they, according to this report, knew back in August. If they were so concerned, why didn't they stop it? What did they do?\nQ: Well, the report is very extensive. It goes into all of those details -- that they were blocked in a number of different measures; that they were concerned about looking like they were intervening in the election on behalf of Hillary Clinton. President Obama did talk to President Putin --\nMR. SPICER: Well, they seemed to throw --\nQ: So what evidence does he have that President Obama was colluding or obstructing?\nMR. SPICER: Well, again, I think it comes back to this idea that they've been very clear, they've been playing this card about blaming Trump and Russia. And yet, at the same time, they were the ones who, according to this report, knew about it and didn't take any action.\nSo the question is, were they -- if they didn't take any action, does that make them complicit? I think that there is a lot of questions that have to get answered about who didn't know what and when.\nQ: Well, is there an element of hypocrisy here, Sean? Because this was President Trump on the campaign trail: \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\"\nHow can you accuse President Obama of obstructing, when he was egging Russia on?\nMR. SPICER: He was joking at the time. We all know. I mean --\nQ: He was joking? He says that as a candidate, and he was pressed during that press conference over and over again.\nMR. SPICER: I understand. And I think the idea was, is that you had Hillary Clinton with a secret server that was very clear about what she had done to evade it. And I think that that's probably a bigger concern right now in terms of what they were doing and the lack of security that they had.\nRonica.\nQ: Sean, thank you. Jeff Mason sent an account out of the meeting that he had with you to the members of the White House Correspondents' Association about the future of the press briefings. Would you say that his account of that meeting was accurate?\nMR. SPICER: I was not provided that. I had the --\nQ: Could you give us an account, from your perspective, of what happened in that meeting and what we --\nMR. SPICER: We had two since then. We had another one since then. Jeff has stated the position of the board that he believes, and I've shared with him where we are on that -- that we have been consistent since December and January where we addressed this issue with them specifically and publically, and that we will continue to have a mix of opportunities to stay in touch with the media.\nQ: Well, there has seemed to have been a drastic shift, starting from maybe the week before the President took his first trip abroad, that now we see you on camera about once a week. Is that a new normal that we would expect?\nMR. SPICER: We'll see. We're just -- we'll continue to mix things up.\nQ: Why are the cameras off, Sean?\nMR. SPICER: Trey.\nQ: Why did you turn them off?\nMR. SPICER: Trey.\nQ: Can you just give us an answer to that?\nMR. SPICER: Trey.\nQ: Can you tell us why you turned the cameras off? Why are they off, Sean?\nQ: It is a legitimate question.\nMR. SPICER: Trey.\nQ: It's a legitimate question.\nMR. SPICER: Trey.\nQ: You are a taxpayer-funded spokesman for the United States government. Can you at least give us an explanation as to why the cameras are off?\nQ: Can we get this out of the way? Can we address the cameras issue? Do you think this will be --\nMR. SPICER: Yeah. Some days we'll have them, some days we won't. The President is going to speak today in the Rose Garden. I want the President's voice to carry the day. Look, this is nothing inconsistent with what we've said since day one.\nQ: Can I ask you about healthcare?\nMR. SPICER: Yes.\nQ: Where does the responsibility lie in the success or failure of the Senate healthcare bill? Obviously, the President and this administration have been directly involved. There's a chance that it may go to the Senate floor and not pass.\nMR. SPICER: Well, obviously the Senate -- I mean, look, the President has made it clear, he wants a bill with heart. He understands. He tweeted earlier that Obamacare is dying. And if we don't take action -- the Democrats own Obamacare. They're the ones who gave it to us. They're the ones who championed it. And they own that result. The President has been the one who has been trying to fix it, trying to give people accessible and affordable healthcare.\nBut make no mistake about it that Obamacare is dying. And the reality, as I mentioned last week, is that, when you look at the majority of House Democrats, they support a single-payer, $32 trillion bill backed by Bernie Sanders. That's what the alternative is.\nIt's not a question of Obamacare versus the American Health Care Act. It's a question between we need to accept that Obamacare is dead, we need to understand that the reality is that what the choice is is between putting in a system that is affordable and accessible, or a single-payer $32 trillion healthcare plan that the majority of House Democrats support.\nQ: Once the CBO score is released, do you envision the President going back to the drawing board? There's a high number of people expected to be uninsured as a result of the Senate healthcare bill. What steps will the President take once he has those numbers?\nMR. SPICER: I think we've addressed CBO scores in the past. We feel very confident with where the bill is. And he's going to continue to listen to senators who have ideas about how to strengthen it. But it's going to follow the same plan as we have.\nQ: Sean, if I could ask you about the --\nMR. SPICER: I'm sorry. The gentleman in the back.\nQ: Could I ask you, Sean, about the goal of U.S. energy dominance, which is being highlighted this week. How is that defined in terms of the Persian Gulf and the Middle East?\nMR. SPICER: In terms of what?\nQ: What does energy dominance mean?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think we'll continue to talk about that throughout the week. But I think we have gone -- we have now -- you take LNG, for example. I think our ability to now export it is a big issue. The idea of using additional power supplies and be able to find ways not only to be self-sufficient, but to figure out how to grow businesses from it, create jobs from energy, use our natural resources.\nYou're going to hear more and more throughout the week about what the President is doing. As I mentioned, he'll have more action on this later in the week where he'll have some action that he's going to be taking on behalf of the administration to move forward our dominance, our independence, our ability to maximize our natural resources and create jobs.\nQ: Does that mean trying to put pressure -- downward pressure on rural oil prices to impact Persian Gulf suppliers?\nMR. SPICER: I think it means a lot of things. I mean, just the ability to now be an exporter helps us in economic ways, but then obviously there is a political aspect to this.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Sean. Two great questions. It was widely reported on Sunday that the President is the first person in the White House since Thomas Jefferson not to have the traditional dinner to mark the end of Ramadan. Was there any reason for this, or was it just an oversight?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know, John.\nQ: The other thing I wanted to ask -- I was a little taken aback by the question on the Supreme Court list. On May the 3rd, I asked Sarah if the President would stick to the list of 21 he had in the campaign from which Judge Gorsuch came, and she said that was her understanding, that he would stay with it and there was no reason to expand it. Has there been any discussion or change of policy in the month between her statement and what you just said?\nMR. SPICER: Well, my only point is that as we fill a lot of vacancies at the circuit-court level all the way up and down the judiciary, there may be people that come into contact that are highly qualified for one reason or another, and that the President may choose at some point down the road, if there's every a vacancy, to consider someone else.\nI think obviously the list that the President put down initially of 21, but now that Justice Gorsuch is off that list he may want to put one additional on. But he always has the flexibility, as he encounters additional members -- potential members of the bench.\nGeorge.\nQ: Do you approve of the attacks on Senator Heller by allies of the President? And is there any danger of putting a Republican Senate seat at risk?\nMR. SPICER: Well, look, I think we're going to work with all of the senators to try to get their support on the American Health Care Act, something that, as I mentioned, the President has been reaching out to all of them who have concerns and issues. And we're going to continue to do that.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Do you have a message to those who are attacking Heller?\nMR. SPICER: I have not seen the ad that you're talking about, but I would just suggest that, obviously, we want to do what we can from a White House perspective to continue to reach out and work with them.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thanks, Sean. You mentioned that the President had been in touch with some of the senators who had concerns about this healthcare bill. I didn't hear you mention any Democrats. And Joe Manchin said yesterday that he had not been called by the President yet. Has the President reached out to any Democrats?\nMR. SPICER: I don't know the answer to that.\nQ: Okay. And then a follow-up on that going back to Joe Manchin, who you had brought up on Friday as somebody who you guys could potentially work with on this bill -- he said in his interview that he would be willing to sit down with the White House if you guys were willing to call it a repair bill or repair effort versus a repeal effort. Is that something that you would be willing to do, the President would be willing to do in order to get some Democrats onboard in a working group?\nMR. SPICER: Well, I think what we need to do is to -- we're going to continue to have a team that will reach out. I'll check with our legislative affairs team and see what they've -- and see what they've done. That being said, we've made it very clear for seven-plus years that we're going to repeal and replace this.\nGoyal.\nQ: One question on India-U.S. relations. This afternoon at the White House, the world's most two powerful leaders -- Prime Minister Modi and President Trump -- of the world's largest and (inaudible) two democracies will be meeting and greeting and have a number of discussions about U.S.-India relations. But Prime Minister Modi said that India will join U.S. to fight against terrorism. At the same time, yesterday, addressing the India-U.S. -- Indian American community in Tyson's Corner, he said that India had been suffering of terrorism for the last 30 years and telling the world to join us. Now time has come that entire world can join India to fight against terrorism. Before it was Taliban and al Qaeda, and now ISIS. What is, do you think, going to happen in fighting against terrorism?\nMR. SPICER: As you mention, I mean, they're going to have a long opportunity today to meet and then have dinner together. They'll talk about their ongoing cooperation, including areas like counterterrorism, our defense partnership in the region, global cooperation, et cetera.\nBut I think that energy -- there's a lot of things that they're going to have an opportunity to discuss, but that will definitely be one that they have plenty of time to discuss. And after they're done, we'll have a readout for you and we'll make sure that you know what areas they covered and hopefully what ground we've made up.\nThank you, guys. See you later.\nEND 2:21 P.M.

Thank you very much. Prime Minister Modi, thank you for being here with us today. It's a great honor to welcome the leader of the world's largest democracy to the White House.\nI have always had a deep admiration for your country and for its people and a profound appreciation for your rich culture, heritage, and traditions. This summer, India will celebrate the 70th anniversary of its independence, and on behalf of the United States, I want to congratulate the Indian people on this magnificent milestone in the life of your very, very incredible nation.\nDuring my campaign, I pledged that if elected, India would have a true friend in the White House. And that is now exactly what you have, a true friend. The friendship between the United States and India is built on shared values, including our shared commitment to democracy. Not many people know it, but both American and the Indian constitutions begin with the same three very beautiful words: We the people.\nThe Prime Minister and I both understand the crucial importance of those words, which helps to form the foundation of cooperation between our two countries. Relations between countries are strongest when they are devoted to the interests of the people we serve. And after our meetings today, I will say that the relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, has never been better.\nI am proud to announce to the media, to the American people, and to the Indian people, that Prime Minister Modi and I are world leaders in social media—[laughter]—we're believers—giving the citizens of our countries the opportunity to hear directly from their elected officials and for us to hear directly from them. I guess it's worked very well in both cases.\nI am thrilled to salute you, Prime Minister Modi, and the Indian people for all that you are accomplishing together. Your accomplishments have been vast. India has the fastest growing economy in the world. We hope we're going to be catching you very soon in terms of percentage increase. I have to tell you that. We're working on it.\nIn just 2 weeks, you will begin to implement the largest tax overhaul in your country's history—we're doing that also, by the way—creating great new opportunities for your citizens. You have a big vision for improving infrastructure, and you are fighting government corruption, which is always a grave threat to democracy.\nTogether, our countries can help chart an optimistic path into the future, one that unleashes the power of new technology, new infrastructure, and the enthusiasm and excitement of very hard-working and very dynamic people.\nI look forward to working with you, Mr. Prime Minister, to create jobs in our countries, to grow our economies, and to create a trading relationship that is fair and reciprocal. It is important that barriers be removed to the export of U.S. goods into your markets and that we reduce our trade deficit with your country. I was pleased to learn about an Indian airline's recent order of 100 new American planes, one of the largest orders of its kind, which will support thousands and thousands of American jobs. We're also looking forward to exporting more American energy to India as your economy grows, including major long-term contracts to purchase American natural gas, which are right now being negotiated, and we will sign them. Trying to get the price up a little bit.\nTo further our economic partnership, I'm excited to report that the Prime Minister has invited my daughter Ivanka to lead the U.S. delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India this fall. And I believe she has accepted.\nFinally, the security partnership between the United States and India is incredibly important. Both our nations have been struck by the evils of terrorism, and we are both determined to destroy terrorist organizations and the radical ideology that drives them. We will destroy radical Islamic terrorism. Our militaries are working every day to enhance cooperation between our military forces. And next month, they will join together with the Japanese navy to take part in the largest maritime exercise ever conducted in the vast Indian Ocean.\nI also thank the Indian people for their contributions to the effort in Afghanistan and for joining us in applying new sanctions against the North Korean regime. The North Korean regime is causing tremendous problems and is something that has to be dealt with and probably dealt with rapidly.\nWorking together, I truly believe our two countries can set an example for many other nations, make great strides in defeating common threats, and make great progress in unleashing amazing prosperity and growth.\nPrime Minister Modi, thank you again for joining me today and for visiting our country and our wonderful White House and Oval Office. I enjoyed our very productive conversation this afternoon and look forward to its continuation tonight at dinner. The future of our partnership has never looked brighter. India and the United States will always be tied together in friendship and respect.\nPrime Minister Modi, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.\nPrime Minister Modi. President Donald Trump and First Lady, Vice President, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen of the media: Right from the opening tweet to the end of our talks, President Trump's welcome, which was filled with friendliness, his warm welcome to the White House by himself and the First Lady, I would like to thank both of you from the bottom of my heart for this warm welcome.\nI would also like to give a special thanks to you, President Trump, for having spent so much time with me, for having spoken such kind words about me and my country. And I would like to tell you that I'm eager to welcome his—your daughter to India for the Entrepreneurship Summit. President Trump, I'd once again like to thank you for the time that you have spent with me. I'd like to give you special time—thanks for that.\nMy visit and our talks today will mark a very important page in the history of the collaboration and cooperation between our two nations. The talks between His Excellency, President Trump, and myself today have been extremely important from all points of view, for several reasons: because they were based on mutual trust; because of the convergence and similarities they revealed in our values, in our priorities, and in our concerns and interests; because they focused on the highest levels of achievement in our cooperation and mutual support and partnership; because our two countries are global engines of growth; because the all-around or comprehensive economic growth and joint progress of both countries and both societies is the main objective for both the President and myself and will remain so; because the top priority for both President Trump and myself is to protect our societies from global challenges like terrorism; and because our aim is the strengthening of India and the U.S.A.—two great democracies in the world—friends.\nOur robust strategic partnership is such that it touches upon almost all areas of human endeavor. In our conversation today, President Trump and I have discussed all dimensions of India-U.S. relations at length. Both nations are committed to a bilateral architecture that will take our strategic partnership to new heights.\nIn this relationship, in both countries, increased productivity, growth, job creation, and breakthrough technologies—an engagement with all these are, and will remain, strong drivers of our cooperation and will give further momentum to our relationship.\nWe consider U.S.A. as our primary partner for India's social and economic transformation in all our flagship programs and schemes. I am sure that the convergence between my vision for a new India and President Trump's vision for \"making America great again\" will add new dimensions to our cooperation.\nI am very clear about the fact that India's interests lie in a strong and prosperous and successful America. In the same way, India's development and its growing role at the international level are in the U.S.A.'s interest.\nOne of our common priorities will be the development of trade, commerce, and investment links. And in this regard, in the technology, innovation, and knowledge-economy sectors, the expansion and deepening of cooperation is also among our priorities. Towards this end, we shall take steps to further strengthen our successful digital partnership.\nFriends, we are not just partners by chance. We are also partners in dealing with current and future challenges that we may be faced with. Today, during our meeting, we discussed the serious challenges of terrorism, extremism, and radicalization, which are the major challenges facing the world today. And we have agreed to enhance our cooperation in fighting against these scourges. Fighting terrorism and doing away with the safe shelters, their sanctuaries, and safe havens will be an important part of our cooperation. With respect to our common concerns on terrorism, we will also enhance our sharing of intelligence and exchanges—and exchange information to deepen and expand our policy coordination as far as possible.\nWe also spoke at length on regional issues. The increasing instability, due to terrorism, in Afghanistan is one of our common concerns. Both India and America have played an important role in rebuilding Afghanistan and in ensuring its security. In order to attain our objectives for peace and stability in Afghanistan, we will maintain close consultation and communication with the U.S. to enhance coordination between our two nations.\nIn the Indo-Pacific region, in order to maintain peace, stability, and prosperity in the region, this is also another objective of our strategic cooperation in this area. The increasing possibilities for enhancing cooperation in order to protect our strategic interests will continue to determine the dimensions of our partnership. We will continue to work with the U.S.A. in this region. With regard to security-related challenges, our enhanced and growing defense and security cooperation is extremely important. We have spoken at length on this subject as well.\nThe strengthening of India's defense capabilities, with the help of U.S.A., is something that we truly appreciate. We have also decided to enhance maritime security cooperation between the two nations. President Trump and I have also spoken about strengthening bilateral defense technology and our trade and manufacturing partnership, which we believe will be mutually beneficial to us.\nWe also discussed international issues and our strategic—our common strategic interests. In this context, we are extremely grateful for the continued support of the United States for India's membership of international institutions and regimes. We truly appreciate the support, because this is also in our—the interests of both our nations.\nPresident Trump, I thank you for your feelings of friendship towards India and myself. I deeply appreciate your strong commitment to the enhancement of our bilateral relations. I am sure that under your leadership, our mutually beneficial strategic partnership will gain new strength, new positivity, and will reach new heights; and that your vast and successful experience in the business world will lend an aggressive and forward-looking agenda to our relations.\nIn this journey of India-America relations, I think I would like to thank you for providing great leadership. Be assured that in this joint journey of our two nations towards development, growth, and prosperity, I will remain a driven, determined, and decisive partner.\nExcellency, my visit today and the extensive talks I have held with you have been very successful, very fruitful. And before leaving this mike, I would like to invite you to India, along with your family. And I hope that you will give me the opportunity to welcome you and host you in India.\nAnd at the end, once again, I'd like to thank you for the warm welcome extended by you and the First Lady to myself and my delegation from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.\nPresident Trump. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it.

We reaffirm our commitment to end the drug abuse epidemic that is plaguing our communities and harming our loved ones, and especially our youth.\nSince 1999, the rate of opioid overdose deaths in the United States has quadrupled. In many cases, other illicit drugs and pharmaceutical products contribute to these fatalities. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death, responsible for more than 50,000 deaths in the United States in 2015 alone.\nWe will not stand idle as our families are devastated, our communities are hollowed out, and our Nation's future is diminished. My proposed Fiscal Year 2018 Budget supports $27.8 billion in drug control efforts, including support for state and local law enforcement, drug treatment facilities, and prevention programs. We have also started the process to strengthen enforcement at our southern border to prevent drugs and gangs from coming into our country. I have already taken several executive actions directing my Administration to protect our communities: from dismantling transnational criminal organizations to creating a special commission that targets opioid drug addiction.\nThankfully, treatment options for people facing addiction have never been better. The evidence supporting medication-assisted treatment gives us reasons to be optimistic, as we work to expand access to treatment and long-term recovery support programs.\nWe resolve today to bring justice to those who threaten the well-being of our people, while we pledge to offer hope to those who have become addicted. Our Nation will continue to collaborate with our international partners to restrict the production and trafficking of illicit drugs around the globe.

And we have had tremendous meetings today, tremendous success, and we enjoy a wonderful relationship, but it's never been better than it is today.\nAnd again, any time you'd like, we want to have you back as soon as possible. Thank you very much for being here.\nPrime Minister Modi. Well, Mr. President, let me express my gratitude for this invitation that was extended to me. It is true that I have spent a very short time over here, but really, I have felt so much at home during this stay in the United States.\nAnd I am indeed also very grateful to the First Lady. She has organized this reception in my honor, and this honors not just me, but 1.25 billion people of India. So, once again, let me thank you and express my gratitude.\nPresident Trump. Thank you very much. Thank you. You know, the Prime Minister was going to come here at a different time, but we worked out this time because they had elections in a section of India. And it's just a small section, but we said, it's the seventh largest country in the world, that small section of India. [Laughter] So I said, you know what, this is a better day. [Laughter] But it is great to have you.\nThank you very much. Thank you all for being here. Thank you very much.\nPrime Minister Modi. And to add icing to the cake is that in those elections, our party won.\nPresident Trump. Good.\nPrime Minister Modi. And after many years, we've got three-fourth majority in the state assembly.\nPresident Trump. That's fantastic. That's a good win indeed. You won by a lot.\nThank you all. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-06-26", "title": "Remarks Prior to a Dinner Reception Honoring Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India"}

It is an honor to join you for the 42nd Annual Leadership Summit of the U.S.-India Business Council. Give yourselves a round of applause. This is a great, great annual event. (Applause.)\nI couldn't be more grateful to join you at this important gathering. And before I get started, I just left the Oval Office a little bit ago, and the President wanted me to bring greetings from a leader who has already strengthened the bond between the United States and India -- the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThis conference is particularly timely. As you all know, yesterday President Trump welcomed Prime Minister Modi to the White House. I was there for most of the meetings. It was a historic and productive time, and at its conclusion, standing next to the Prime Minister, President Trump declared that India had in his words a \"true friend in the White House\" -- and so do all of our friends from India who are gathered here. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump recognizes that the United States' relationship with India is one of the most important strategic relationships in the 21st century.\nOur two great nations are bound by friendship, by commerce -- so well represented by American and Indian businesses here. And we're partners in the fight against global terrorism and as brothers-and-sisters in the cause of freedom and our commitment to democracy. And today, I say with confidence: Under the leadership of President Donald Trump, our friendship will grow deeper, our partnership will grow stronger for the benefit of both of our nations and our people -- and the world. (Applause.)\nAs you well know, commerce is central to both of our nations' prosperity and well-being; the commerce between us that is. Fortunately, the United States and India have formed a strong trade relationship in recent years -- in no small part thanks to the work of the U.S.-India Business Council over these four decades.\nAnd for more than 40 years, this council has brought together leaders in industry and leaders in public life to \"promote bilateral trade,\" foster investment, job growth, innovation in both of our nations. And you've succeeded by any stretch of the word. So why don't you give yourselves just one more round of applause for promoting a tremendous relationship between two great nations? (Applause.)\nAnd let me also offer the President and our entire administration's congratulations to the two winners of this year's Leadership Award who I just met in the back room -- Adi Godrej of the Godrej Group and my friend Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical Company. My congratulations to both of you for this well-deserved honor. (Applause.)\nAnd thanks to the companies represented in this room, the trade relationship between the United States and India is flourishing. It's remarkable to think that not even 20 years ago, two-way trade between our nations was less than $20 billion per year. But by the end of last year, it had grown by more than 500 percent to an annual $115 billion in trade; and U.S. exports to India now support roughly 200,000 American jobs.\nThe last few years have been particularly noteworthy. Between 2014 and today, American foreign direct investment in India grew from $800 million to $2.4 billion in investments.\nAnd on the other side of the ledger, Indian businesses I'm glad to report are investing in America at an unprecedented rate. For instance: Earlier this year, Infosys announced it would hire 10,000 new American workers at four U.S.-based technology centers, one of which will be in my home state of Indiana. And we thank you for investing and believing in America. (Applause.)\nOur heartfelt appreciation to all the businesses represented here for your investment in our nation's future. Yet the truth is the United States and India we believe have only scratched the surface when it comes to bilateral investment and trade. This council hopes to more than quadruple our two-way trade relationship to more than $500 billion before the decade is out, and the President and I believe that that goal is achievable.\nYesterday, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi committed to expanding and balancing our trade relationship in the years ahead.\nFor our part, this administration is fully committed to restoring the United States' reputation as the premier investment destination anywhere in the world. And let me assure everyone gathered here: America is open for business once again. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump has already taken decisive action to make the strongest economy in the world stronger still. This President has signed more laws to cut through red tape than any President in American history that already have saved businesses up to $18 billion in regulatory costs per year.\nPresident Trump has put a renewed focus on American energy, approving the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines. And the President is strengthening the American workforce by signing executive action into place to prioritize apprenticeships and vocational training to meet the needs of growing businesses and a growing American economy.\nAnd if you haven't noticed yet, the American people elected a builder to be President of the United States, and President Trump has already taken steps to rebuild America. And before we're done we're going to rebuild the roads and bridges and harbors and airports of America to the very best in the world. (Applause.)\nAnd this year, let me assure you: Working with the Congress, we'll pass one of the largest tax cuts in American history so businesses from across the world can invest in American jobs, America's workers, and America's future.\nAnd there's one more thing, our President is also even as we speak fighting every day to give the American people the world-class health care they deserve. And working with this Congress, I can say to the American businesses that are gathered here and all of you who do business in America, we're going to keep our promise the American people. We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare and give the American people the kind of world-class healthcare they deserve. And we're going to do it before the summer is out. (Applause.)\nOur hope is that President Trump's actions give companies in this country great confidence about the future, but also give our friends in India even greater reason to invest in America.\nAnd of course, American business wants to contribute even more to India's success through exports and investment. Prime Minister Modi saw American industry's excitement about India on Sunday when he met with 21 business leaders before his bilateral meeting with our President. There are many places where this nation's firms can benefit our great partner.\nIndia is projected to become the world's third-largest market for planes and passengers. American companies are already providing airport infrastructure and the airplanes themselves. I just had the chance to meet with the CEO of SpiceJet who just last week placed an order for 40 brand new Boeing jets, on top of 100 new jets it ordered earlier this year. I know that American companies are going to continue to give India's aviation industry the wings it needs to soar. And let me just take the opportunity, as the President did yesterday, to say thank you to SpiceJet for investing and believing in American workers and American businesses. (Applause.)\nEnergy is another area for a more robust partnership. India boasts the world's fastest-growing economy. But it can't continue without energy, and American producers and grid developers are the best-suited to provide it. From liquefied natural gas, to nuclear power, to clean coal, to everything in between, American energy and American expertise can help power India's future.\nThe final example I'll mention is in the area of security and defense. A first-rate global power needs a first-rate military, and the United States will continue to enable the Indian armed forces to obtain the resources and technology it needs to protect the Indian people and support security in the region. You need look no further than yesterday's announcement that the United States will sell Sea Guardian UAVs, Apache attack helicopters, and C-17 transports to India. That process of approval is all underway as we speak. But I hope it accurately reflects the commitment to mutual security among both of our nations and the importance of our partnership for security.\nThe bottom line is the United States and India can deepen our commercial bond in many industries and areas. But to achieve the highest possible benefit, I would suggest with great respect that India must continue to enact the necessary economic reforms to ensure that our trade relationship, as the President said last night over dinner, is both \"fair and reciprocal.\"\nThe President and I applaud Prime Minister Modi for his courageous move to simplify and standardize the Goods and Services Tax, the largest tax reform in India's history.\nWe support Prime Minister Modi in his effort to strengthen Indiana's -- India's intellectual property protections, and cut tariffs on manufactured and agricultural goods, and break down the barriers to investment and market access.\nBut we truly believe with great respect that the time to act is now -- because progress in these areas means progress for both our great nations and the more than 1.6 billion people that call them home.\nI know the U.S.-India Business Council will continue to play a leading role in promoting pro-growth policies and engaging new commercial partnerships.\nAnd our administration is committed to this goal, as well. As the President announced yesterday, his daughter Ivanka Trump will lead the American delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India this fall.\nAnd I was very humbled when the Prime Minister Modi extended a personal invitation to me to represent the United States. And we're already making plans to take him up on his invitation. (Applause.) In fact, I told him when I was governor of Indiana one of my ambitions was to be the first governor from Indiana to visit India. (Laughter.) I didn't get it done then, but the Prime Minister and I had a nice chuckle because he told me that the words \"India ana\" mean \"coming to India.\" (Applause.)\nThe President and I are very confident that with the help of this great council, with the commitment that the President and Prime Minister Modi renewed yesterday, we're going to usher in a new era of jobs, opportunity, and prosperity for both our countries and for all our people.\nBut as we all reflect that security is the foundation of our prosperity, and under the leadership of President Trump, the United States will also expand our partnership with India to protect our nations, our citizens, and the values that we cherish.\nYesterday, President Trump reaffirmed the United States' commitment to our in his words \"incredibly important\" \"security partnership\" with India.\nWe're proud that India is a Major Defense Partner for the United States. And as the President said yesterday, \"our militaries are working every day and will continue to enhance cooperation,\" and working together, we'll \"make great strides in defeating the common threats\" that we face.\nThe United States and India seek the same objectives in the Indo-Pacific region: prosperity, security, peace.\nWe both want to uphold a rules-based system of national sovereignty and international law. We both want lawful commerce to flow unimpeded on the seas and in the air. (Applause.)\nThese practices and principles are foundational to prosperity and security across the Indo-Pacific, and the United States is grateful to see India step into its role as a regional security provider and partner.\nBut our two nations' mutual interests stretch far beyond the region. As India has grown, so has its role on the world stage. And in recognition of this fact, let me assure you: President Trump and our administration fully support India's permanent membership on a reformed United Nations Security Council. (Applause.)\nIn this time of widening challenges and unknowable threats, the United States welcomes India's strong bilateral relationships with our common friends and partners across the world, such as Japan and Australia, countries across the Middle East and Southeast Asia because we increasingly -- all of us -- face the same issues and face the same challenges.\nOf course, the greatest threat facing the peace and prosperity of Indo-Pacific region is the brutal regime in North Korea. President Trump and I are grateful for India's leadership in fully implementing the United Nations' sanctions and for its commitment to use its growing global leverage to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea.\nWe must not waver in our resolve. North Korea's reckless actions are a threat to us all, and so all of us must continue to step forward to work in close cooperation with one another and all our allies and partners in the region to ensure that we bring the appropriate amount of economic and diplomatic pressure until North Korea permanently abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programs once and for all. (Applause.)\nLet me also thank India for its continued commitment to stability and security in Afghanistan. A peaceful Afghanistan is good for India, it's good for America, and a peaceful Afghanistan is good for the region and the wider world.\nAnd finally, the United States and India are committed to strengthening our partnership in the fight against the greatest evil of our time -- the threat of global terrorism.\nLike the United States, India is all too familiar with the grave danger posed by radical Islamic terrorists. These barbarians have struck on Indian soil too many times over the decades, including the horrific attacks in Mumbai nearly a decade ago, claiming the lives of more than 160 innocents, including six Americans.\nThe United States and India already collaborate to a significant extent. But in the face of terror networks that are ever-more sophisticated, ever-more dispersed, we will continue to take renewed action to facilitate two-way information and intelligence sharing to confront this threat.\nOnly by working together can we protect our people from the terrorist threat. President Trump and Prime Minister Modi have already agreed to strengthen our partnership for the protection of both of our nations and our people, and together, I am convinced in our time, we will drive the cancer of global terrorism from the face of the Earth. (Applause.)\nThis is a very exciting time for the relationship between the United States and India. I could see it in the faces of the two leaders yesterday and in the warm exchanges that took place between our delegations.\nAs President Trump said just last night, the \"future of our partnership has never looked brighter.\" And I believe it. Long after the cameras left the Blue Room, we had an engaging time together -- warm fellowship among friends. As Prime Minister Modi would say across the table as we talked about issues of mutual interest, he said, we speak to one another as friends. And we always will.\nEvery day, the people of India and the people of the America are drawing closer together. At this very moment, some 4 million Americans trace their heritage back to India already, as the children and grandchildren of immigrants, or as first-generation immigrants themselves.\nAnd truth be told, their impact on America has made a profound difference in the life of our nation, and we celebrate that. Let's hear a round of applause for all our Indian Americans. (Applause.)\nFor generations, you Indian Americans have raised your families, built businesses, studied and taught in our colleges and universities, made your own mark, large and small, and been an inexorably vital part of the beautiful tapestry of American life. And we celebrate it.\nAs I stand before you today, I can't help but feel a small measure of pride on behalf of the President to think of the first Indian American to serve on the Cabinet of a President of the United States, the Ambassador to the United Nations for our nation, Ambassador Nikki Haley. (Applause.)\nThe people of the United States and the people of India already share a friendship -- and more than that, we share a future.\nI believe our two nations have the power, have the vision, the shared ideals to guide this still-new century to greater prosperity and greater freedom together. I truly believe it's our responsibility to help guide countries around the world by our example on the path to prosperity, to guide it on a path to security. And I believe it is the responsibility of the United States and India to do this together, to guide the 21st century on a path to democracy and freedom.\nWe hold the future in our hands -- but I have faith -- that with your help, and the continued energy of all the great men and women who have been a part of this council for some 40 years, with the leadership of President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Modi, and with God's help, that the best days for America and India are yet to come.\nThank you for the honor of addressing you today. God bless you all and God bless the nation of India and the United States of America.

{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126582", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:31 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Nice crowd. I know everybody is excited about Energy Week; we certainly are here at the White House. And that's why we've got Secretary of Energy Rick Perry here to talk to you about what the President and others in the administration are doing all this week to emphasize our commitment to American energy dominance, and he'll take some of your questions after that. And, of course, I will be happy to step back up after that and answer questions on other non-energy-related topics.\nSECRETARY PERRY: We'll be ecstatic -- ecstatic.\nMS. SANDERS: And be nice to him -- he's from Texas. Not quite Arkansas, but still a good neighbor.\nSECRETARY PERRY: A good neighbor.\nSarah, thank you. And my privilege to be here today to share with you a little bit of the observation that I have relative to Energy Week. This week, the Trump administration will bring together state, tribal, business, labor -- all together, one room -- happily sitting down and discussing how we're going to go forward, what the path forward is for U.S. energy dominance.\nAnd President Trump wants America to achieve energy dominance by utilizing our abundant resources for good, both here and abroad. And an energy-dominant America means self-reliant, it means a secure nation, free from the geopolitical turmoil of other nations who seek to use energy as an economic weapon. An energy-dominant America will export to markets around the world, increasing our global leadership and our influence.\nAt DOE and across the administration, we're ending the bureaucratic blockade that has hindered American energy creation. The United States has been a net energy exporter -- excuse me, a net energy importer since 1953, almost as long as I've been alive. But thanks to innovation and technology advancements, we're on the brink of changing this, and in very important elements of an American energy portfolio. Ten years ago, people would never have guessed that by 2018 the United States is expected to be a net energy exporter of natural gas. American companies can and already have exported U.S. LNG to our international trading partners in Europe and Asia. Unleashing our full energy potential in this country will lead to robust job growth and expansion in every sector of our economy.\nThis week we will also reaffirm our commitment to clean energy. That binary choice between pro-economy and pro-environment that has perpetuated -- or, I should say, been perpetuated by the Obama administration has set up a false argument. The fact is, we can do good for both -- and we will. There was one fact missing from the headlines about the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and that is that the United States already leads the world in lowering emissions. And we've done this through innovation and technology, not by signing agreements. The Paris Agreement put the taxpayer on the hook for a costly deal. There was a billion dollars already out the door. Thankfully, this President has the good sense to step in before billions more had been committed.\nWe've already seen the fruits of innovative, clean technology, like CCUS -- carbon capture, utilization and sequestration. The Petra Nova plant, just on the outskirts of Houston, Texas, uses a process to remove 90 percent of the carbon dioxide after coal is burned to generate energy in a clean way. Then it uses that captured carbon for enhanced oil recovery.\nInstead of preaching about clean energy, this administration will act on it. I believe no clean energy portfolio is truly complete without nuclear power, and so does the President. If you want to see the environment and the climate that we live in affected in a positive way, you must include nuclear energy with zero emissions to your portfolio. Do it safe, do it thoughtfully, do it economically. Under the leadership of the United States, the world can benefit from that.\nThis administration believes that nuclear energy development can be a game-changer and an important player in the development of our clean-energy portfolio globally. I believe we can achieve this by focusing on the development of technology, for instance, advanced nuclear reactors, small modular reactors.\nUnder President Trump's leadership, we will continue to advocate for a very broad, all-of-the-above energy portfolio to allow the United States to achieve energy independence, dramatically reducing our trade deficits, and create jobs beyond the 6.4 million Americans who are currently employed in that sector.\nWe look forward to hearing from Americans this week about how we can best move forward to reduce unnecessary government regulation and bureaucracy to promote jobs and economic growth in the energy sector. For years, they have been overregulated by Washington politicians and bureaucrats who believed they knew best. The lecturing is over with, and now it's time that we listen.\nWith that, I will attempt to answer your questions.\nQ: On nuclear power, what specifically do you want to do to accelerate its development? And as has been seen in Georgia, there are still problems. The Obama administration greenlighted two plants; they're bogged down primarily because a lot of Americans haven't built a nuclear power plant in three decades. There's a technology gap there. So how do you deal with that? Number one.\nAnd number two, if this administration does advance production of nuclear power, does it believe Yukka Mountain needs to be opened up, or that needs to be reconsidered as a repository for nuclear waste?\nSECRETARY PERRY: Well, it's I think a very astute question you ask about the issue. For 30 years, the supply chain basically was stagnant. It was allowed to atrophy, if you will.\nThis administration truly believes in an all-of-the-above approach, allowing nuclear energy to come and play an important role in a very diverse portfolio. So the idea that overregulating an industry -- that is one of the challenges. And it's not just about the United States from the standpoint of our being able to have an energy source that is reliable, that is zero emission. It's about America maintaining -- or regaining may be a better word -- our leadership role in nuclear energy, because the Russians and the Chinese are very actively engaged across the board, globally, to go put their technology to gain and leverage their political place, if you will, using nuclear energy as one of the levers.\nSo this is a lot bigger issue than just allowing the United States a couple of plants in the southern part of the United States. It's a lot bigger than that. It's a lot bigger than just making sure that Westinghouse continues to be a stable American company. This is a massively important issue for the security of America and the security for America's allies.\nSo keeping that in place, I think it's important for us to look at the options, clearly having a plan to keep America engaged in the development of nuclear energy. One of the things we want to do at DOE is to make nuclear energy cool again, from the standpoint of -- if you remember when we were kids -- well, sorry, you're nowhere near my age -- but when I was younger in the '60s and a lot of kids wanted to go into the nuclear energy field. At my alma mater there were a lot of young boys and girls who wanted to be nuclear engineers.\nThat's not so much the case today because this industry has been strangled all too often by government regulations. But we need as a county, I think, to again bring us to that place where the nuclear energy is a part of a portfolio and to be able to sell it in great truthfulness and honesty about what it can add to America both from an environmental standpoint and from a security standpoint.\nQ: What about Yucca Mountain? What about Yucca Mountain?\nSECRETARY PERRY: Well, you know, we've made no decisions at DOE, nor has this administration, from the standpoint of where we're going to look. Obviously, those are all options but there's been no decision made about where it will be going.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, two questions for you. You mentioned the Paris --\nSECRETARY PERRY: Why do you all get two questions?\nQ: We like to get in as much as we can.\nSECRETARY PERRY: Kind of the game we play now? (Laughter.)\nQ: He only gets two. The rest of us get three. (Laughter.)\nQ: You mentioned the Paris Agreement. Do you believe, sir, that climate change is happening and that human activity has made it worse?\nSECRETARY PERRY: Here's what I believe -- and I'm pretty much on the record but I love getting the opportunity to talk about it again -- is the climate is changing. Man is having an impact on it. I've said that time after time. The idea that we can't have an intellectual conversation about just what are the actual impacts. I mean, as late as this last week, an undersecretary for the Obama administration, Steve Koonin -- he believes that we need to have a sit-down and have a conversation. That the data is not, from his perspective -- and obviously he was a good enough scientist to be asked by the Obama administration to come in and be an undersecretary at the DOE -- he doesn't think that the science is settled. So why not have a conversation about that?\nI mean, what is the other side? The people who say the science is settled, it's done -- if you don't believe that you're a skeptic, a Luddite. I don't buy that. I don't think there is -- I mean, this is America. Have a conversation. Let's come out of the shadows of hiding behind your political statements and let's talk about it. What's wrong with that? And I'm full well -- I can be convinced, but let's talk about it.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Hold on, just to finish your thought. You said that you do believe that climate change is happening and you do believe that human activity is contributing to it. So the discussion you're asking for is just what to do about it?\nSECRETARY PERRY: Sure. Is that okay? I mean, don't you think we ought to do that?\nQ: It's not up for me to say whether it's okay --\nSECRETARY PERRY: But why? I mean, you're an American citizen. You ought to have part in that.\nQ: Secretary Perry, you have a lot of energy. (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY PERRY: I come from a place with a lot of energy.\nQ: Yes, sir. My one question is on U.S.-India energy relations, which Prime Minister Modi had a discussion here with President Trump. Energy was the major discussion of issues and also, of course, pending civil nuclear energy between the U.S. and India. So can you talk, sir -- where do we stand as far as energy is concerned? Because India is still waiting when the U.S. talks will move as far as nuclear and clean energy is concerned.\nSECRETARY PERRY: Well, let me address the global issue of the United States and India and the relationship between the Trump administration and the Modi administration. And I happen to think -- there was a picture yesterday that I happened to see that I thought was very reflective, and it was of these two individuals embracing each other. And I think that was a clear message around the world that the United States and India are going to be substantially closer. Energy is going to play a very, very important role in that.\nLast night at dinner, we talked about the three areas of which there will be great back-and-forth cooperation -- deal-making, if you will. One of those is in LNG. The other side of that is in clean coal. Thirdly is on the nuclear side. So there is great opportunity for India and the United States to become even stronger allies, stronger partners -- energy being the glue that will hold that partnership together for a long, long time.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Mr. Perry, quick questions. Well, two actually. First of all, those who --\nSECRETARY PERRY: Our gentleman over here is the only one who that had an honest look on his face. (Laughter.)\nQ: I have two for you, sir. You had said that it's not binary -- the environment and energy coexisted. But the real question is, as far as fracking and clean coal -- opponents to that say that, in fact, that it isn't environmentally safe and that fracking and coal are going to destroy the environment. I'd like to get your comments on that before the second question.\nSECRETARY PERRY: Coming from a state that probably did as much hydraulic fracking as any other state in the nation -- and interestingly, a number of things happened in Texas over the decade-plus that I was the governor. One was, there were more jobs created in the state than any other. There were 7 million people added to population roles while I was governor. There arguably, economically, that the state led the country.\nThere's also a lesser-known story that you probably don't know about but I'm going to share it with you, and that is that during that period of time you had this massive job growth, you had this population growth of 7 million -- you know what 7 million people is? That's a lot of pickup trucks on highways. That's a lot of non-point source pollution, correct?\nYour conventional wisdom would tell you because of where you are geographically, the latitude, that you're prone because of that big petrochemical manufacturing capacity along the Gulf Coast, to really drive up ozone levels. There's a lot of reasons that conventional wisdom would say you did a really fine job of creating wealth and jobs, but you played hell with the economy -- or, excuse me, with the environment. And the fact is we didn't. We drove down nitrogen oxide levels by over 60 percent, SO2 levels in the mid-50s, and carbon dioxide levels by almost 20 percent reduction. Isn't that our goal?\nMy point is, Texas, which is the 12th largest economy in the world, did exactly what I said. You can have economic growth and you can have the environment affected in a positive way. It can happen.\nQ: Hold on, I had a second question. I just want to follow up on Jeff when he was talking about climate change. Just to be straight, you're saying that --\nSECRETARY PERRY: Really be straight.\nQ: As straight as possible. Climate change is a fact but you want us to have a discussion about exactly what has to be done about the climate change? It's not up for discussion, that part of it?\nSECRETARY PERRY: I have no idea what you just asked. (Laughter.)\nQ: I asked you to be as straight as possible. Climate change affected by man --\nSECRETARY PERRY: One more time, you get one more chance. (Laughter.)\nQ: All right. I'm only speaking English. I can try a different way.\nSECRETARY PERRY: (Inaudible) about how you're putting this out here.\nQ: I'm putting it out this way. You are saying that climate change -- man has affected climate change, and that the discussion is about what we do with it, not whether or not we've affected it. So going forward, that's resolved.\nSECRETARY PERRY: No, what I said was: Climate is changing, always has. Man at this particular point of time is having effect on it. How much effect is what's at debate here? And more importantly, what is the United States going to do to affect that? Are we going to sign an agreement with somebody that really doesn't call anybody to making any changes? You look at that agreement and what China and what India are required to do and they're nothing. How many coal plants?\nQ: 300.\nSECRETARY PERRY: 300-plus coal plants we built in India. So why would we sign on to an agreement that is not holding other people to account and asking us to give $3 billion? I mean, that's the first ante. And the Trump Administration said that's nonsense. I agree with them it's nonsense.\nNow, can we agree we ought to have a conversation as a people? Intellectually engaged, not screaming at each other, and not standing up in the middle of my speeches and saying you're a climate denier, when the fact is, I just want to have a conversation about this.\nQ: Isn't that what the scientists have done?\nSECRETARY PERRY: No, they haven't. Because when you have a scientist like Steve Koonin who stands up and says the science isn't settled yet, I can say, okay, well let's have a conversation and get these guys together. In my Senate committee, I said let's -- Senate hearing -- I said let's have a conversation about the blue team and red team getting together and talking this out.\nOkay, you're up.\nQ: Secretary Perry, thanks for being here. I want to ask you about coal specifically. The EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, earlier this month said -- and he was quoting -- he appeared to be quoting the Department of Labor's statistics. He said, very simply, that the U.S. has added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In fact, the coal portion -- he was referring to since the fourth quarter -- in fact, the coal portion itself has only grown 2,400 jobs, and in the last month it only great 400. There are only a total of 51,000 coal jobs in this country right now. So is it misleading Americans -- is the administration misleading Americans about where the real job growth is right now in this industry?\nSECRETARY PERRY: I don't think so. And I was --\nQ: Is coal a growth industry?\nSECRETARY PERRY: I was governor a long enough period of time that job numbers come and go. They go up and down, back and forth. What this administration wants to do is to send a message across the country and around the world that America is going to use all of its energy resources in a thoughtful, appropriate, and economically feasible way.\nThe coal industry is part of that. When I had conversations with my counterparts in Rome at the G7, when I go to the clean coal ministerial in China, in Beijing earlier this month, we talked about coal. And we talked about the opportunity of American coal to be sold globally.\nSo the idea that we're going to be continuing to develop that fossil fuel, that's a reality. That's real. We're going to use coal as a producer of energy for years to come. I think the question for us is, are we able to do it in a way that is economically feasible, environmentally sensitive? And I think the answer is yes. Petra Nova in Houston, great example of that.\nSo the point is, taking that snapshot and saying, okay, this is a static picture may be a little bit unfair.\nQ: And then following up quickly, if I can, since you get behind the scenes in ways that we don't. During the campaign, you famously said of candidate Trump that his candidacy was a cancer on conservatism.\nSECRETARY PERRY: That has nothing to do with energy today. (Laughter.)\nQ: But he's been here for six months.\nMr. Secretary, what do you make of it? QYou get to see him in person. What do you make of his conservatism? It's a simple question, I think.\nSECRETARY PERRY: How are you? Good to see you. You asked --\nQ: Did you call on me?\nSECRETARY PERRY: Yes, sir.\nQ: Okay, great. I thought you were talking to Tom.\nSECRETARY PERRY: I was. I was just saying hi to Tom. He's just a great American. (Laughter.)\nQ: So maybe you help us resolve something. Questions have been asked here a lot in this briefing room. The President himself during the campaign called climate change a \"hoax.\" Have you had that conversation with him? Do you know if he shares your view that, in fact, the climate is changing and human activity at this point in time is contributing to that change?\nSECRETARY PERRY: I have not had that conversation with him.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time. I want to ask you about your concerns about the electrical grid and what you all are doing to ensure not just its safety, but further growth and development. And on gas prices, are you concerned about the direction they're going? Should American people expect gas prices to continue to fall?\nSECRETARY PERRY: So let's get over on the grid. Obviously, the Department of Energy has a both scientific, they have a historic reason to be involved with that. One is that, at one of our national labs, we have a test grid of which we are able to go out -- one of the reasons that the Department of Homeland Security and DOE is involved with grid security is that DOE operates a substantial grid -- a test grid, if you will -- where we can go out and actually break things. We can infest it with different viruses and what have you to be able to analyze how we're going to harden our grid so that Americans can know that our country is doing everything that it can to protect, defend this country against either cyberattacks that would affect our electrical security or otherwise.\nSo the ability for us to be able to continue to lead the world -- I think we all know the challenges. We saw the reports as late as today of what's going on in Ukraine. And so protecting this country, its grid against not just cyber, but also against physical attacks, against attacks that may come from Mother Nature, weather-related events -- all of that is a very important part of what DOE, DHS is doing together.\nWhat was your second?\nQ: Gas prices.\nSECRETARY PERRY: You know, I'm not in the business of trying to tell people what's going to happen on gas prices. I mean, they may go up, they may go down, just like they've always done. Our job is to make sure that America has a diverse energy portfolio so that we have as many options as we can have -- whether it's developing -- we went and developed huge wind energy portfolio in Texas while I was the governor.\nOne of the reasons we were driven that way was because gas prices went to $12, $13 an Mcl. And we had way too much invested, if you will, in just one or two sources of energy and we thought it made sense to look at these renewables from the standpoint of having diversity in our grid.\nSo that's our job, to try to have as diverse an energy portfolio as we can in this country. The market will manage the cost of gasoline, and supply and demand will work.\nQ: On that cyberattack you were taking about, can you give us an update? Do you think that the U.S. energy grid is being targeted with this particular cyberattack? And can you give us an update on U.S. utilities and --\nSECRETARY PERRY: Listen, I don't have any reason to be different from you that think and know that there are cyber actors out there, cyber terrorists. They may or may not work with nation states. They may be lone-type rangers, attackers, if you will, that would try to get in to hold companies, countries hostage in some form or fashion.\nSo whether it's a particular country, I don't have any reason to point at one country and say this one is -- we know that they're involved in certain places in the world. They're out there. Instead of worrying about who they are and what's going on, and then here in a public setting, doing the work to make sure -- as he asked -- he made a point about having the best security that we can, have the best defenses that we can to be able to identify and to protect our grid.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, thank you. You've mentioned the Paris climate agreement a number of times. President Trump said he wanted to get a better deal. Has he or you or anyone in this administration begun that process? And do you think it's possible, given that a number of leaders have said it's a deal that can't be renegotiated?\nSECRETARY PERRY: I'm pretty sure the President of the United States wakes up every day thinking about how to get a better deal in a host of different things. Specifically to that, I never said, Mr. President, let's talk about what the better deal is.\nWith that said, I don't have a problem -- whether it was renegotiating NAFTA, which some of you have been around here long enough to know that I was involved with the original NAFTA negotiations -- and I think renegotiate the deal. Get a better one. That's what President Trump does. That's his mindset. And I think our allies and/or those that may not be our allies need to understand that that's where we're going to be coming from.\nQ: On renewables, Mr. Secretary, you mentioned that you did this work in Texas. What do you see as the role -- you've mentioned at greater length, whether it's fracking or clean coal, as you cited it, or nuclear -- where do you see the role for renewables moving forward from this administration?\nSECRETARY PERRY: I think that renewables are proving themselves to be a valuable part of a diverse portfolio. So I full well expect solar and wind and maybe some forms of energy that we don't even know yet that one of our extraordinary national labs is being looked at right now that may give us some potentials that we don't even realize we have.\nYes, ma'am. Right in the middle.\nQ: And a follow-up on Peter's questions about jobs, because that's where a lot of the jobs are happening now. We especially see in solar and wind. So do you see this as a growth for the American job market?\nSECRETARY PERRY: Sure.\nQ: Sir, I want to go back to a piece that really has not been talked about -- the issue of coal. There are some critics who are saying this administration wants to make coal great again. Talk to me about -- and us about your plans with coal. It is basically being wanted by many countries around the world, and we still have yet to figure out a clean enough use for it as you're dealing with climate change issues.\nSECRETARY PERRY: Well, I'm not sure if I agree with your observation that we haven't figured out a clean use for coal yet from the standpoint --\nQ: Is it clean enough? It's a challenge --\nSECRETARY PERRY: There's some that you can't make it clean enough, so -- and I guess that's who I'm referencing to. But when you can take 90 percent and upwards of the CO2 out of the air when you're burning coal, I don't know how high you have to raise the bar to make some people happy.\nWith that said, let me share with you some of the things that we're seeing in our national labs, for instance, being able to -- coal is the root source of rare earth minerals. And if we hadn't done this work on clean coal technology, we would not have realized that there are ways that we can extract these rare earth minerals out of coal, coal ash.\nAnd so again, I ask people to be open-minded about innovation. You all remember 15 years ago, and we were hearing this fella travel around the country giving a speech about peak oil. We had found all the oil there was. Sarah, your dad and I went to lots of Republican governors' meetings, and one of them, this guy came and gave a speech and he said, we've found all the fossil fuels, all the oil and gas has been found, it's a downward slope, that's a fact. Settled science may have been his word. I don't recall that, but he might have said that.\nThat was the point, though, that all the oil and gas had been found. Except George Mitchell didn't read the -- he didn't read that, didn't believe that. Innovation, technology drives this country. It always has. And I think we ought to be a little skeptical when somebody says, this is the end of this, this is bad. It's okay to ask those questions.\nSo my point is that with coal, there may be some uses of coal that we never even dreamed of before that can really make a big difference. Because when you think about the rare earth minerals that are controlled by countries outside of the United States, and our being able to come up with the technology to retrieve those may be a real game changer.\nSo with that, I'm --\nQ: One last question, sir.\nSECRETARY PERRY: Yes.\nQ: You're a former governor, and people are talking about states as it relates to repeal and replace of Obamacare. If you had states' rights -- so thank you.\nSECRETARY PERRY: By and large, I wasn't going to talk about anything outside of energy, but you've touched on one of my favorite subjects. (Laughter.)\nQ: Well, thank you.\nSECRETARY PERRY: And that is federalism. And I had --\nQ: Uh-oh.\nSECRETARY PERRY: Yes, here we go. (Laughter.) You asked. I mean, thank you, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.\nQ: I'm ready for it. I'm ready for it.\nSECRETARY PERRY: So I happen to believe that the states are laboratories of innovation. They're innovators just like we have at our national labs. Governors I think have within their states and their bright young people who work with them and the private sector, they will come up with ways to deliver healthcare that can put more people under coverage for less money and give options to their citizens.\nI know for a fact that Connecticut is not like Texas. They're just not. And to say that Washington, D.C. can come up with a one-size-fits-all solution to healthcare that's going to address all this and do it in an economically feasible, thoughtful way is just so much nonsense. It's just -- you know that's not true. Let the states have this Medicaid opportunity, the ones that want it. If somebody says, oh, I'd rather have Washington take care of me, then that's okay, that's their call. But the states ought to be given the opportunity.\nAnd I will suggest to you it can save substantial amounts of money, come up with options for their citizens that are substantially better for the citizens of their state, and save this country mountains of money.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, going back to the threats against the power grid, what about the threats of an EMP attack? What are the steps being taken to prevent against that, or to protect against that sort of attack?\nSECRETARY PERRY: I think our national labs are looking at all options, that being one of them.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, one quick follow-up on your comments earlier about Westinghouse -- an American company. Obviously it's been owned by Toshiba for more than a decade now, but Westinghouse is in the middle of these bankruptcy proceedings and several buyers are on the market. You sit on (inaudible). Are you saying that you would block efforts by any foreign company to purchase what remains of Westinghouse Electric?\nSECRETARY PERRY: I know the process, and that is a classified piece of information that I will not give here.\nQ: If I can follow on cybersecurity. Have you been given reports about a current cyber break-in at a number of U.S. nuclear plants? It's been confirmed by the grid monitor. The investigation, I think, is codenamed Nuclear 17. Do you have any information about that?\nSECRETARY PERRY: No, sir.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. This morning, President Macron of France called President Trump and invited him to come to Bastille Day, July 14th. Do you see this as a way that the French are taking up his suggestion for negotiating a new climate change agreement? And would you urge him to make the trip?\nSECRETARY PERRY: I would always look at an invitation to a party as a good thing. (Laughter.)\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you're very enthusiastic about nuclear power and the potential that it has. A lot of people are still scared of nuclear power because of nuclear waste and nuclear plant safety. And this has been happening since the '60s, when one television documentarian said that really it hasn't changed in terms of what we know to do with nuclear waste, which isn't much. Can you assure the American people that nuclear waste and nuclear plant safety are such that we should expand nuclear power in this country?\nSECRETARY PERRY: You know, I would reflect that -- or deflect that, if he was here, to President Macron of France, who gets 70-plus percent of their power from nuclear energy.\nNow, this is the country that wouldn't buy Texas beef for some reason, yet 76 percent of their energy comes from nuclear power. So the French, who I've always thought were a little bit different -- (laughter) -- and that's in a good way. You know, they recognized us as a state back in the 1830s, so we actually have a really close, personal relationship with the French. We like them. We had an embassy in Paris. They had one in Austin; as a matter of fact it's still there, called the French Legation. Invite all of you to come and see it.\nBut the French are a little different when it comes to some things. And one of those I would find it really interesting -- our French friends are very comfortable getting 76 percent, thereabouts, of their energy from nuclear, and I can assure you they're very fond of getting it at the rate they're getting it.\nQ: Can I ask a question about Yucca Mountain, please? A Yucca Mountain question, please? Right over here.\nSECRETARY PERRY: One last question. I'll just go back to this side. You're the last question. Yes, sir.\nQ: Thank you. Mr. Secretary, thank you. You mentioned federalism, the power of governors. Recently, as you know, the Trump administration has scrapped the Clean Power Plan, which was hampering many states. Now you've got governors, who you just said have a certain authority -- you've got governors that are saying, we're going to go ahead and institute the Clean Power Plan in our states anyway regardless of what the EPA says. Doesn't that put those states at a tremendous economic disadvantage? And what would be your message, sir, to those governors?\nSECRETARY PERRY: I think governors and their citizens need to be given that right to make those decisions. I said many times that I thought that Colorado was wrong in allowing for the use of marijuana, which they've decided to do. But that's their call. I will defend that right robustly. But that ought to be their call. If they want to put -- I mean, Jerry Brown, we were together at the -- in China, at Beijing for the clean energy ministerial. We saw each other, shook hands, walked -- as we were going by. Jerry has decided he wants his state to be involved with the Paris agreement, however that works, which is fine. That's his call. Texas will still be there to take any businesses that would like to relocate.\nAnd that's the beauty of all of this: Allow America to be competitive. Allow Americans to pick and choose where they want to live, under what types of governments, and we'll figure it out. But this idea that we're going to have one-size-fits-all out of Washington, D.C. -- one of the reasons I came to serve with President Trump was because I knew he believed in that and he believes in competition. And the future of America is brighter because we have a President who believes in American exceptionalism, American competition, and making America great again.\nThank you.\nQ: Please come back.\nQ: Come on back.\nSECRETARY PERRY: It was enjoyable.\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think anybody will question whether or not Secretary Perry is a high-energy guy, that's for sure. Great guy. Wrong football team, but that's probably for another day.\nOn top of Energy Week and everything that Secretary Perry and other Cabinet members have on the agenda for that, we've got a full schedule of events and actions from the President's Cabinet today, on everything from global human trafficking to assistance, funding for small communities.\nThis morning, Ivanka Trump joined Secretary Tillerson at a State Department event releasing the 2017 Trafficking and Persons Report. As Ivanka said this morning, human trafficking is a human rights issue that affects millions, and this report is an important tool for the administration to combat this tragic problem. The full report is available on the State Department website. I encourage you guys to take a look.\nAlso this morning, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Secretary Shulkin hosted a meeting of robotics experts for a robotics and healthcare roundtable. The VA is embarking on the largest transformation and modernization effort in recent history, and part of that will be developing a robust robotics program within the Department.\nYesterday, the Interior Department announced a record $464.6 million allocation to help small communities, further demonstrating the Trump administration's commitment to all Americans. In states like Utah, which received nearly $40 million, and Nevada, which received $26.2 million, these investments are an important part of the federal government's role as land manager and neighbor to local communities, including many of those that play a big role in feeding and powering our nation.\nMany of these small communities in states like Nevada are also being hit particularly hard as healthcare insurance premiums rise and insurers flee their Obamacare exchanges. It's because of the people who will have no choice for themselves or their families that it's so critical that the Senate votes to repeal and replace Obamacare. Every day, a new announcement is made that puts health insurance out of reach for thousands of Americans, whether insurers are hiking up rates or leaving markets entirely.\nToday, the Vice President is on the Hill to attend the Senate policy lunch and hold additional meetings. And he'll be hosting senators at dinner tonight in his residence. Both the President and the Vice President are fully engaged with the Senate and are helping to create a consensus that will push this bill over the finish line.\nAs Sean said yesterday, the President talked extensively with several Republican members over the weekend, including Senators Cruz, Paul, Capito, and Johnson. He spoke to Senator McConnell this morning, and he's invited all Republican senators to the White House later this afternoon to continue these discussions. The President is optimistic that Republicans will live up to the promise that they've been making to the American people for seven years by repealing and replacing Obamacare.\nI know you guys are probably a little bit tired since we've been here a while, so you want to skip on the questions? (Laughter.) I figured it was worth a shot. And with that, I'll take your questions.\nCharlie.\nQ: Recently, Breitbart News challenged the accuracy of a CNN story, and afterwards it was retracted, deleted and the editors responsible were fired, as well as -- the network apologized for the story. The target of this -- one of the targets of the story accepted the apology. The President went on Twitter this morning and repeated that CNN was fake news. Why isn't their response good enough for the President?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know that it's that the response isn't good enough for the President. I think it's the constant barrage of fake news directed at this President probably that has garnered a lot of his frustration.\nYou point to that report; there are multiple other instances where that outlet that you referenced has been repeatedly wrong and had to point that out or be corrected. There's a video circulating now, whether it's accurate or not I don't know, but I would encourage everybody in this room, and, frankly, everybody across the country to take a look at it. I think if it is accurate, I think it's a disgrace to all of media, to all of journalism.\nI think that we have gone to a place where if the media can't be trusted to report the news, then that's a dangerous place for America. And I think if that is the place that certain outlets are going, particularly for the purpose of spiking ratings, and if that's coming directly from the top, I think that's even more scary and certainly more disgraceful. And I hope that that's not the direction we're headed. I hope that outlets that have continued to use either unnamed sources, sometimes stories with no sources at all -- we've been going on this Russia-Trump hoax for the better part of a year now with no evidence of anything.\nThings like the success at the VA barely get covered. They may get covered for an hour at a time, but this story gets covered day in, day out. And I think America is, frankly, looking for something better. They're looking for something more. And I think they deserve something better from our news media.\nQ: Does the President actually expect --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: Does the President actually expect us not to report on stories of a foreign country trying to influence the presidential election?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think it's that it's expected that you're not to report on, again, actual news if there's something there. But again, I think that there are a lot of things happening in this world that, frankly, a lot of people would like to hear about -- whether it's job growth, whether it's deregulation, whether it's tax reform, healthcare. I think a lot of those things deserve a lot more coverage than they get.\nAnd all we're saying is I think that we should take a really good look at what we are focused on, what we are covering and making sure that it's actually accurate and it's honest. If we make the slightest mistake, the slightest word is off, it is just an absolutely tirade from a lot of people in this room. But news outlets get to go on day after day and site unnamed sources, use stories without sources, have -- you mentioned the Scaramucci story --\nQ: But, Sarah they can --\nMS. SANDERS: -- where they had to have reporters resign.\nQ: Sarah, that's -- come on. You're inflaming everybody right here and right now with those words. This administration has done that as well. Why in the name of heavens -- any one of us, right, are replaceable, and any one of us, if we don't get it right, the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or not read us. You have been elected to serve for four years at least. There's no option other than that. We're here to ask you questions, you're here to provide the answers, and what you just did is inflammatory to people all over the country who look at it and say, see, once again, the President is right and everybody else out here is fake media. And everybody in this room is only trying to do their job.\nMS. SANDERS: Well, I just -- I disagree completely. First of all, I think if anything has been inflamed it's the dishonesty that often takes place by the news media. And I think it is outrageous for you to accuse me of inflaming a story when I was simply trying to respond to his question.\nKevin.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I just -- rapid fire because I don't -- we've had a bit of a long briefing here. With the -- let me ask it this way -- how would you describe the President's mood on healthcare? Concerned, still encouraged? And what did you make of the CBO score, if you've talked to him about that? And then secondly, I want to ask you about the warning to Syria. What's the message that the administration wants to convey, not just to the world community but also to the American people who see headlines like that and they wonder are we hurtling headlong into a major situation in that part of the world.\nMS. SANDERS: I'll start with healthcare first. Obviously, we're continuing to be optimistic. The President is committed, he said, and all the members of the administration have said repeatedly, to repealing and replacing Obamacare, working with the Senate, working with the House, making sure we get the best bill. For us it's never been about the timeline but about getting the best piece of legislation that helps the most Americans. And that's what we're continuing to do day in, day out. That's the reason the President has asked members of the Senate to come here today, so that they can talk through that, so that they can figure out the best way to move the ball forward. That's the goal of the meeting this afternoon, and that's the goal of the administration.\nIn terms of the CBO score, as we said yesterday, the CBO is a budget office. And while it does very well at times predicting things on budget -- whether it's revenue or spending -- I don't think it does a great job -- and I think the administration has been clear and consistent that we don't always agree that it does a great job predicting coverage.\nI think we saw that, given their history -- they projected that Obamacare, there would be 24 million people that were part of that; there were only 11 [million], and that number is dropping every day. So I don't have a lot of confidence in that number on that part, but I do think that some of the places where they do a good job again are on the budget and the revenue side. And the CBO score that they pointed out was that it would cut deficits by $300 billion and cut taxes by $700 billion.\nI think those are good things, and I think when they focus on the budget side, that's probably a good thing. And I think you had a second part, sorry.\nQ: Syria, the warning to Syria. What's your message to the international community and also to the American people who may be concerned when they read a headline like that they're thinking, well, we may be hurtling toward a situation that involves the U.S. in that part of the world?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the message from the statement yesterday was extremely clear. I don't think it was a gray area; it was pretty black and white.\nMajor.\nQ: Can you explain -- because you went on the record this morning -- what the process was that led to that statement last night? Were members of the team at the State Department or the Defense Department taken aback by that statement, or were they fully involved? Can you give us an idea of how the process internally worked to deliberate that statement and then create the statement for public release?\nMS. SANDERS: Right. I can tell you that leadership from the State Department, DOD, DNI, the CIA, as well as members of the administration within this building were part of that process from the very beginning and fully aware.\nQ: Can you give us a timeline from the very beginning? Was that on yesterday or is it --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to walk through the detailed process of a timeline on how that was released for intelligence purposes.\nQ: And on healthcare, you just said you accept or find valid the CBO numbers on the budget side. Is that true --\nMS. SANDERS: I mean, there are budget --\nQ: In its -- assessment yesterday?\nMS. SANDERS: They're a budget office. And I think on the initial numbers that we saw, from that, -- the cutting of the deficit, the cutting of taxes -- I think that that's where historically they've been more accurate as well. It's not just my -- like I've decided that. But historically, that's where they've been --\nQ: And for the purposes of the public looking at this, would this administration accept the budget and revenue numbers that were published yesterday as, generally speaking, valid and worth taking seriously?\nMS. SANDERS: I would think so. For the most part, I think -- in large -- yes.\nJennifer.\nQ: Two things, one on Google and one on the economic forecast. So European officials have slapped Google with this $2.7 billion fine. Is the White House cool with European regulators hitting a U.S. company with a fine when our own Federal Trade Commission hasn't accused them of anti-competitive behavior?\nMS. SANDERS: At this point, I don't have anything for us to weigh in on the regulations of a private company. But if anything changes, I'll let you know.\nKristen. Oh, sorry.\nQ: Okay, and also on the International Monetary Fund. So they lowered their forecast for U.S. economic growth down to 2.1 percent, which is lower than what the President has been -- hope for. Can you share some reaction on what you think about this new IMF forecast?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had a chance to dig into that, but we'll certainly circle back with you on it.\nJim Stinson.\nQ: Sarah -- you called on me, Sarah.\nMS. SANDERS: Oh, sorry. Jim, let me take Kristen. I did call on her. I'll come back to you.\nQ: Thank you. I appreciate it. If Syria is poised to launch another chemical weapons attack, isn't that an acknowledgement that the airstrikes in April didn't work, Sarah?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think that our goal every day is to do what we can to protect life in all forms and to take steps to move the ball forward in defeating ISIS, defeating all efforts of terrorism, and I think the statement yesterday helped to do that.\nQ: Why will a paper statement work, though, when airstrikes didn't dissuade Bashar al-Assad?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know that it didn't based on what we know at this point.\nQ: And just to follow up very quickly, was there a principals' meeting, a deputies' meeting before that statement was issued by Sean Spicer last night?\nMS. SANDERS: I know that there was a routine meeting that took place yesterday. I don't believe that there was anything beyond that yesterday.\nQ: Sarah, two questions, just like NBC. Given the news about CNN's --\nMS. SANDERS: Be careful about letting NBC set your standard. (Laughter.)\nQ: Given the news about CNN's erroneous story about Anthony Scaramucci, does the White House believe there are other Russia-related stories from major outlets that have not been retracted and are just as false, including the February 14th story in The New York Times about collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, which James Comey called into question, which many believe the CNN story was based upon?\nMS. SANDERS: I would have to look back at that specific story. There have been many by The New York Times that I would probably disagree quite a bit with. I think you could take it pretty straightforward that this administration disagrees with all of the stories that claim that the President and his campaign colluded with Russia in any capacity.\nSo I think he's been extremely clear that he believes that's a hoax and certainly something that's not true and didn't take place. And any story related to that you would I think find frustration from this team here.\nQ: On the CNN retraction, does the White House now believe the news media have an obligation to review stories on the Russian-Trump issue and retract questionably sourced stories on the topic?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry? I'm not following the --\nQ: Do you believe that the media should go back and look at anonymously sourced stories on Russia and Trump and maybe start a review process and retract where necessary?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that would be a great idea. I certainly don't think that you would get arguments from us if there were retractions from outlets on fake stories. But I also think that there's a moment where we can all do better, and I certainly think that's what we strive to do every day. And hopefully that's the goal -- I know it is -- of many, and hopefully it will continue to be of not just the news media but everybody involved in the process to continue to do better, to continue to strive for excellence, and to continue to deliver the best we can for the American people.\nMara.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two healthcare questions. Okay, so you accept the budgetary calculations of the CBO, but not the projections on how many people would be insured. What about their projections on what would happen to premiums and deductibles? Is that something you accept or not accept?\nMS. SANDERS: I mean, I think they said yesterday that the premiums would go down roughly 30 percent by 2020. That seems, based on what we've done internally, pretty consistent, so --\nQ: Well, they also said that for people of certain incomes they would go way up. So you only accept them if they go down?\nMS. SANDERS: No, but I think in general and largely they predicted that they'd go down 30 percent by 2020.\nQ: Okay, and then another question. The President promised that his healthcare plan would not have cuts to Medicaid. Does he believe that a family of four making $60,000 makes too much money to qualify for Medicaid? In other words, that that's just too high an income to be getting Medicaid?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know about a specific -- like a level breakdown. And again, there's a reason he's bringing senators over here today to talk through -- we know there's going to be changes. We know there's going to be adjustments. The thing that the President was committed to was making sure that anybody that currently receives Medicare -- that's not -- Medicaid, sorry -- Medicaid that's not touched. And that is consistent with what's in the bill, and that will continue to be what he fights for.\nQ: Does he believe -- he said the House bill was too mean. Does he believe that the Senate bill is less mean, as mean, more mean? Like what does he think?\nMS. SANDERS: I honestly haven't asked him whether or not he thinks the Senate bill -- the mood of it yet but I'll check on that, Mara, and get back to you.\nThanks, guys, so much. Have a good day.\nEND 3:29 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-06-27", "title": "Press Briefing by Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders"}

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126615", "text": "\"Together, we are going to start a new energy revolution -- one that celebrates American production on American soil.\" – President Donald J. Trump\nACHIEVING AMERICAN ENERGY DOMINANCE: President Donald J. Trump has taken action in his first five months to remove unnecessary and burdensome roadblocks that would have prevented the United States from achieving energy dominance.\n* President Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord.\n* According to National Economic Research Associates (NERA), by 2040 the Paris Climate Accord would have cost the economy nearly $3 trillion and as many as 6.5 million industrial sector jobs, including 3.1 million manufacturing jobs.\n* President Trump directed the Environmental Protection Agency to rescind the Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan.\n* According to NERA, the Obama plan would have increased electricity rates by as much as 14 percent, costing American households $79 billion.\n* President Trump called for TransCanada to resubmit its application to build the Keystone XL Pipeline, and he then fast tracked its approval.\n* Construction of the Keystone pipeline is expected to support 42,100 jobs and contribute $3.4 billion to the American economy.\n* President Trump ended the Obama Administration's coal leasing moratorium on Federal land.\n* Federal land accounts for 40 percent of the nation's coal production.\n* According to the American Action Forum, the moratorium could have cost the country billions of dollars and killed coal industry jobs.\n* President Trump rescinded the Obama Administration's Stream Protection Rule.\n* The Stream Protection rule would have imposed $1.2 billion in regulatory costs and added 218,000 hours of paperwork on American businesses.\n* The National Mining Association estimated the rule would cost 280,000 jobs across the economy.\n* President Trump directed the Department of the Interior to reconsider the Obama Bureau of Land Management's Hydraulic Fracturing Rule.\n* The Hydraulic Fracturing Rule was expected to cost the industry $32 million a year, adding $11,400 to the average cost of a hydraulic fracturing well.\nCRITICAL TO AN AMERICAN ECONOMIC BOOM: The United States energy industry is critical to the economy and future economic growth.\n* The energy sector has become a leading driver in hiring American workers, currently employing 6.4 million Americans.\n* Last year, the energy sector added over 300,000 new jobs and is expected to add 198,000 new jobs this year.\n* The average annual wage of workers in the oil and gas extraction industry is over $90,000.\n* Approximately 32 percent of the 6.5 million construction industry employees work on energy or energy efficiency projects.\n* After being a net energy importer since 1953, the United States could be a net energy exporter as soon as 2020.\n* The natural gas revolution in the United States means our country will be a global player in exporting liquefied natural gas.\n* According to the American Action Forum, natural gas exports from 2016 to 2040 could bring in $1.6 trillion in trade value, increase workers earnings by $110 billion, and raise $118 billion in Federal revenue.\nENERGY POTENTIAL: While Americans have been told they would have to settle for declining energy resources, innovation and new technology have opened trillions of dollars of energy for development.\n* For too long, the country's energy policy has operated on the false assumption that the country was running out of energy.\n* In 2006, Former Vice President Al Gore claimed we are \"at or near what they call peak oil.\"\n* In 2011, Former President Obama claim \"we can't just drill our way out of the problem.\"\n* In reality, American innovation and technology have allowed the United States to access an increasing amount of resources.\n* Current estimates suggest we have 20 percent more oil than Saudi Arabia, valued at over $13 trillion, if prices average $50 a barrel.\n* The United States is on track to export an average 1 million barrels of oil a day this year, double the pace of last year.\n* Natural gas reserves are expected to be so large that they can meet domestic demand for almost a century.\n* The United States has the second largest coal reserves in the world.\nPROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: President Trump is following through on his promises to the American people.\n* On March 28, 2017, President Donald Trump said:\n* \"We will unlock job-producing natural gas, oil, and shale energy. We will produce American coal to power American industry. We will transport American energy through American pipelines, made with American steel.\"\n* \"Together, we will create millions of good American jobs -- also, so many energy jobs -- and really lead to unbelievable prosperity all throughout our country.\"\n* On June 28, 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump:\n* \"It will be American hands that remake this country, and it will be American energy -- mined from American resources -- that powers this country.\"\n* \"We are also going to fully capture America's tremendous energy capacity. This will create vast profits for our workers and begin reducing our deficit.\"", "timestamp": "2017-06-27", "title": "Press Release - President Donald J. Trump Unleashes America's Energy Potential"}

HIV has been one of the world's most significant health challenges since it was first identified 35 years ago. Greater awareness through testing is crucial in defeating HIV and AIDS. Thankfully, because of progress in testing and treatment, we have never been closer to conquering the epidemic.\nToday, there are 1.1 million people living with HIV in America, 15 percent of whom do not yet know their HIV status. Among young Americans infected by the virus, only 50 percent know they have contracted it. HIV carriers who do not know they have the virus put themselves and others at risk, missing out on life-saving treatment and possibly, inadvertently infecting others. People who are not currently receiving treatment transmit more than 90 percent of infections, as they do not benefit from treatments that dramatically reduce the amount of virus in their bodies. That is why the key to interrupting the chain of transmission is a simple, routine HIV test.\nThanks to concerted efforts to diagnose and treat more and more people, Americans living with HIV today are living longer, healthier lives than ever before. My Administration is determined to build upon these improvements and continue supporting domestic and global health programs that prioritize testing and treatment for HIV/AIDS.\nOn National HIV Testing Day, I encourage Americans to learn their HIV status.

It truly is. And before I get started, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine, a man the people of Ohio voted overwhelmingly to send to the Oval Office, the 45th President of the United States of America -- President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThe President sent me here today to say thank you. Thank you to all the good people of Ohio for your unwavering support. And I want to promise you, you got exactly what you voted for. You elected a fighter. You elected a winner, and I promise you President Donald Trump will never stop fighting for the issues that matter most to the American people -- good jobs, safe streets, and a boundless American future. (Applause.)\nAnd I'm really very touched that you all would come out today on a Wednesday afternoon. And I'm grateful to be joined today by another friend of mine, a strong partner of this administration, a leader who represents Ohio with such distinction in Washington, D.C. -- Congressman Jim Renacci is here. Jim, would mind standing up? (Applause.)\nI was for Jim Renacci before it was cool. (Laughter.) I really was. I got to know him before he was even elected to the Congress, and now he serves on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. He's been a great champion of economic growth and jobs here in Ohio, and I truly honored, truly honored that you'd be with us today, Congressman.\nAnd of course, thank you to Mike Gordon for that kind introduction and thank you to the whole team here at Tendon Manufacturing. This is a great American success story. (Applause.)\nThis business really is what America is all about. It's remarkable to think that nearly 30 years ago, Tendon got off the ground with only six employees. But you've clearly been doing something right here because today the company employs more than 75 people in good-paying jobs. You've got a state-of-the-art operation. You're living the American Dream by doing the thing most people think is impossible. You're just doing a great job every day, and your customers are responding. Give this whole team a round of applause, will you? Great job. (Applause.)\nAnd I got to tell you, President Trump knows just how important manufacturing is in this country. The truth is companies like this one are the engine of the American economy. They're the beating heart of our national life. And I'll make you a promise: President Trump is going to be the best friend American manufacturing will ever have. (Applause.)\nThe President promised to in his words to \"set the stage for a great revival\" for our factories, a new Buy American, Hire American agenda. And thanks to the President's decisive action, American manufacturing is already roaring back.\nIn the first five months of last year, American manufacturers lost 24,000 jobs. The first five months of this year, under President Donald Trump, businesses large and small have created more than 600,000 new good-paying jobs -- including 55,000 new manufacturing jobs all across America. (Applause.)\nAnd going back decades, manufacturers have invested in jobs and factories in other countries. But this year you've seen it in the newspapers, company after company are making record investment -- investing billions of dollars in America and creating American jobs instead of investing and building factories overseas. (Applause.)\nToday, American manufacturers are more optimistic than at any point in the last 20 years. Confidence is back. Manufacturing is back because since day one of this administration, President Trump has been fighting tirelessly for manufacturers and the men and women who work the factory floors just like this one.\nHere's a couple of examples. Since the outset of this administration this President has signed more laws cutting federal red tape than any President in American history. (Applause.)\nThe President's actions have already saved American business and American workers up to $18 billion per year. That's money that our companies can invest in workers and in payroll and further investment in their futures.\nAnd this President has been putting America first every single day, like the day a couple of weeks back when he withdrew the United States of America from the Paris Climate Accord. (Applause.)\nAs the President said it best -- that international agreement by some estimates would have cost 6.5 million jobs in this country in the next 25 years, put an enormous burden on our workers, on our economy while virtually letting countries like China and India get off scot-free for decades.\nYou can look at all the statistics, but the President understands his job when he said he was elected to represent Pittsburgh, not Paris -- Cleveland, not Copenhagen. And by withdrawing from that terrible deal, President Trump put America First, and he always will put America First. (Applause.)\nThis week is actually Energy Week, as well. And the President has been busy advancing American energy and American energy independence, ushering in a new era of energy dominance for this entire country.\nThe President approved the Keystone and Dakota pipelines. And Dakota pipeline is already open, building the infrastructure of this country for energy. (Applause.) He's rolled back the Clean Power Plan that's been raising electrical rates in states around the country. And under President Donald Trump, the war on coal is over. (Applause.)\nAnd the President has also not just been cutting red tape and making energy more affordable, but the President has also been focused on making sure that men and women of this country have the opportunities to get the skills education that's necessary to support their aspirations and to support a growing American future.\nThe President is working every day to make sure that the next generation has the opportunity to pursue careers in manufacturing and the skill trades. The truth of the matter is we're going to make vocational education a priority in every state and in every community in America once again. (Applause.)\nJust two weeks ago, the President signed an executive order to expand apprenticeships and vocational training across this country. And under the President's leadership, I'm confident we'll train the students of today for the jobs of tomorrow -- not here at great places like Tendon Manufacturing alone but in companies large and small all across the country.\nThe President promised to get the American economy moving again, and he's done exactly that. As I've traveled across this country on behalf of our President, coming to businesses just like this, talking to people just like you, I see the truth: President Trump has turned this country and our economy around -- and the world knows that America is back. (Applause.)\nBut as the President likes to say, what I just described to you is just a good start. The truth is we got a lot more work to do. And I came here today to assure you of one piece of work that they're going to get done. Before this summer is out, President Trump is going to work with this Congress, and we're going to keep a promise to the American people, and we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nEvery day that Obamacare survives is another day the American people struggle. I heard it from local businesses in a conversation we just had at the other end of this plant. We all remember the broken promises they made back when they passed Obamacare about seven years ago. You remember them. They said if you like your doctor you can keep them -- not true. They said if you like your health insurance you can keep it -- not true. We were told the cost of health insurance would go down -- not true at all.\nNow we know the facts. Just last month, our administration released a new study of actual numbers proving that Obamacare has made health insurance more unaffordable for millions of Americans.\nHere in Ohio, Obamacare has spiked premiums on the individual market by nearly 90 percent in just the last few years. President Obama actually promised that you'd save up to $2,500 in your annual premiums back when Obamacare was passed, but the average premium now costs nearly $2,500 more than it did in 2013.\nAnd it's only getting worse. Working families in Ohio and all over America are facing double-digit premium hikes heading into 2018. Add in the sky-high deductibles that often cost more than $10,000 or more for family plans, and it quickly becomes clear that Obamacare is not only unaffordable, but it's getting more unaffordable every day. I mean it's amazing to think 6.5 million Americans today choose to pay the fine instead of paying for insurance under Obamacare.\nI actually met with some families this week in Washington, D.C. who said in effect there was no difference between paying a fine and getting nothing or paying the same amount of money and getting health insurance that they essentially couldn't use because the deductible was so high.\nAnd while costs are skyrocketing, choices are plummeting. Right now a third of American counties, including five whole states, only have one choice of an Obamacare health insurance provider -- which basically means you have no choice at all.\nAnd come next year, tens of thousands of Americans or more may have no Obamacare coverage available because health insurers are abandoning this failed law left and right. You see the headlines every day all across this country.\nJust a few weeks ago, the last statewide health insurer announced that it would pull out of Obamacare right here in Ohio by the end of 2018. Now at least 18 counties in Ohio and 12,000 Ohio citizens or more won't have any Obamacare insurance to choose from at all.\nOhio really is a case study in Obamacare's collapse, and this failed policy is taking working families to a place where they have to struggle even more every day.\nAnd, folks, remember -- it's one of the reasons I stopped and talked to the small-business owners before I met today; it's another reason that I had families out in Washington, D.C. at the White House; and the President and I have been traveling the country talking to folks because it's one thing -- as the Congressman knows -- to talk about the numbers. And policymakers have to look at the numbers. We're talking about real people. We're talking about families that are struggling to make ends meet.\nJust a few days ago, at the White House, I met with a small group of families that are in that category, including a couple of Ohio families who have suffered tremendously under Obamacare. I met Connie Mays. She's a great woman who's lived her whole life in the same small town here in Ohio where she grew up.\nA few years ago, Connie became disabled and could no longer work. She was counting on her Obamacare coverage to get her through this difficult time. But it's not working out. Connie lost her health-insurance plan at the end of last year. Choices began to plummet on the Ohio exchange.\nShe tried to make the best of it. She told me she worked with the exchange to find a new plan, and she was told that they had found something similar to the one she had lost. But after three months of Connie paying expensive premiums, she learned that her new Obamacare plan didn't cover any of the doctors or hospitals or clinics in her county that dealt with her condition. None.\nConnie lost her plan. She lost her doctor, and she's just about lost hope that she'll ever find the health insurance that she needs to make it through.\nWell, I looked Connie in the eye and I'm looking all of you in the eye, and on behalf of President Trump, I'm here to tell you, help is on the way. We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare, and we're going to give Connie and all of you and the American people the kind of world-class healthcare you deserve. (Applause.)\nObamacare has failed and Obamacare must go. You'd have to be a politician blinded by partisanship to believe otherwise. But sadly, Congress is full of them. Regardless of what they say, the very ones who gave us Obamacare now won't lift a finger to help clean up the mess that they made seven years ago.\nIt is remarkable: The Democrats in Congress today would rather let Obamacare implode and let the country suffer, rather than admit their mistake and help Republicans rescue the American people.\nBut they won't succeed I promise you because President Donald Trump will not rest and will not relent until we repeal and replace this failed law and end the Obamacare nightmare once and for all. (Applause.)\nThe President and I are grateful for the efforts in the House of Representatives, and Congressman Renacci was a key part of the progress they made in the House. And we're personally grateful for the leadership of the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, and all the Republicans in the Senate, including Ohio's own Senator Rob Portman, who are working, who are discussing, and who are talking about how we can move this legislation forward to give the American people a healthcare system that actually works.\nI'm here to say we're making great progress every single day, and we're not going to let up. The bill being considered in the Senate repeals and replaces Obamacare, plain and simple. It sets us on a path to a new healthcare system in America built on more freedom, more choices, and more affordability.\nThe bill repeals Obamacare's mandates and taxes on the American people and American business. It restores freedom and saves jobs. The legislation being considered in the Senate expands health savings accounts, offers tax credits to help you buy the coverage that you need at a price you can afford. And the bill ensures that every American with preexisting conditions has access to the coverage and the care that they need -- no exceptions. (Applause.)\nAnd the Senate's bill reforms -- like the House bill, the Senate's bill reforms and strengthens Medicaid for the people who need it most. This legislation will give states like Ohio the freedom and flexibility that your governor and your legislature need to be able to style Medicaid here in Ohio to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in the way that works best in Ohio -- because this President believes in state-based solutions, not one-size-fits-all-Washington answers to the challenges we face. (Applause.)\nAnd I'm also pleased that the Senate bill addresses something that hits close to home right here in the Midwest and here in Ohio, and that is the scourge of opioid abuse and addiction. We saw it in Indiana, and you've seen it here in Ohio, as well.\nThis legislation actually provides new resources to address the heartbreaking opioid crisis that's ravaging towns and families.\nLet me say that Senator Rob Portman has been a true leader on this issue, and the President and I are grateful for his work. Senator Portman's heartfelt leadership was crucial to passing the CURES Act last year, which gave states like Ohio all new support to address the opioid crisis and help those in need.\nAnd with the leadership and support of Senator Rob Portman and his help, I know that President Trump and this administration will do even more to confront the scourge of opioid addiction and bring relief to families that are struggling under the weight of this terrible, terrible affliction. (Applause.)\nWe're going to work with the Senator, and we're going to work with members of Congress, and we're going to put America on a road to healing from this terrible addiction. But as I said before: President Trump and I firmly support the Senate's bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, but I promise you our administration is going to continue to work closely with members of the Congress, with Senator Portman and other members of the Senate to improve this bill, and we're going to give the American people access to the world-class healthcare that they deserve.\nAnd when we repeal and replace Obamacare, it's going to be a historic day for American health care. We're going to create a dynamic, national health insurance market when we're all done that will lower costs, improve quality, and give more choices to working families.\nWe're going to give American businesses like those that are here today the freedom to give their employees the coverage and the care that they want to give them. And after seven years of failed policies under Obamacare, we're going to put patients back in control of their own healthcare instead of bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)\nThis is the moment. Now is the time. For the past seven years, we've had a healthcare system based on the flawed premise that the federal government should order every American to buy health insurance, whether they want it or not; that bureaucrats and politicians in Washington, D.C. know better than patients and doctors; and worst of all, that the American people can't be trusted to run our own lives and make our own healthcare choices.\nMen and women of Ohio, I'm here to tell you we are on the precipice of an opportunity to restore a healthcare system in America based on the proven American principles of personal responsibility, free-market competition, state-based reform. And we have a chance to restore a healthcare system based on the ultimate American principle of freedom -- that's the American way to meet the needs of healthcare in the American economy in the next century. And we're going to fight until we get it done. (Applause.)\nWe've got our work cut out for us. The truth is we need your help to get it done. We need each one of you to let your voice be heard, let your elected representatives in Washington, D.C. hear what I heard today from so many of you about the failure of Obamacare, the burden its placed on families and your belief that we can do better, that we can turn our ship of state back in the direction of freedom, of patient-centered care, of state-based innovation and reform for our most vulnerable. But they got to hear from you, folks. So I encourage you, in this moment, reach out and speak out. It will make a difference.\nAnd let me say as soon as we repeal and replace Obamacare, next up -- working with Congressman Renacci and all the conservatives in the House and the Senate -- we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. It's next. It's coming next. (Applause.)\nWe're going to lower taxes on the American people and we're going to lower taxes on American businesses so companies in America can compete with companies around the world to create jobs here in Ohio and all across this country instead of shipping them overseas. (Applause.)\nBut this is all where you come in as I mentioned. President Trump and I are counting on all of you, all the good people of Ohio to let your voice be heard.\nIf you like what you've seen so far in the last five months, just buckle up. We're just getting started. We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. We're going to cut taxes. We're going to continue to steer the policies of this country toward American strength as we rebuild our military and stand tall in the world once again. (Applause.)\nIt's the greatest honor of my life as the father of a United States Marine to serve with a President who cares so much about the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States of America. (Applause.)\nIn the midst of everything we've done to get this economy going again, and we all know that security is the foundation of our prosperity, this President has already signed legislation supported by the Congress for the largest increase in military spending in the last 10 years. And before the year is out, we're going to pass a budget that includes the largest increase in defense spending since the days of Ronald Reagan. (Applause.)\nWe're going to rebuild our military. We're going to restore the arsenal of democracy, and we are once again going to give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and training they need to accomplish their mission, keep us safe, and come home safe to their families. (Applause.)\nSo it's a tall order, but I serve with a tall President. (Laughter.) Broad shoulders and a big heart -- and he's going to keep right on fighting.\nAnd I know we'll succeed. I know this because I have faith in this President. I see him every day when the cameras are off. I see his resilience and his determination. I see his love for his family, his love for this country, and his boundless energy to turn this country around.\nAnd I also have the other kind of faith. I always love being in Ohio where your state motto reads: With God, all things are possible. (Applause.)\nIn these times of too much division in America, of widening and unknowable threats around the world, a struggling economy, as you stand by this President and those who stand by him, I encourage you to avail yourself of that motto's wisdom.\nIf you're of a mind to bow the head and bend the knee, it would be a good time to do it, to pray for this country. But when you pray, I don't mean pray for an agenda or pray for a party. I rather like what Abraham Lincoln said in his time when he was asked if he thought God was on the side of the Union Army. President Lincoln responded, my concern is not whether God is on our side. My greatest concern is that we be on God's side.\nAnd so pray for America. Pray for this country. (Applause.) Because America matters far beyond our shores.\nAnd so with confidence in all of you, with boundless confidence in the President I have the privilege to serve, and with faith in Him who set this miracle of democracy on these wilderness shores, I can tell you I know in my heart of hearts that with your support, and with President Trump in the White House, we will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And to borrow a phrase -- we will Make America Great Again. (Applause.)\nThank you all very much. God bless you. God bless Ohio and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-06-28", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President on Healthcare at Tendon Manufacturing in Cleveland, Ohio"}

{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126579", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:36 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. First off, before we get started, I want bring up Tom Homan, the Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and John Huber, the United States Attorney from Utah, to tell you about two upcoming pieces of immigration legislation that will be voted on in the House later this week. And after they finish, as always, I will come back and take some more questions.\nThanks, guys.\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Tom Homan, and I'm the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I'm at the White House today to participate in a roundtable discussion with President Trump and other important stakeholders, including families of victims who have been killed by illegal aliens.\nICE's new Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, otherwise known as the VOICE Office, is working with families like the ones we'll be sitting with today to assist them in the aftermath of crimes that could have been prevented.\nMore than 400 calls from victims have been referred to our community relations officers and victim specialists for assistance with accessing resources, getting more information about a specific case, and how the immigration process works. Sanctuary jurisdictions pose a threat to the American public by refusing to work with ICE and allowing egregious criminal offenders back into the community to put the lives of the public at risk. Not to mention the fact, it also puts my law enforcement officers at risk because they have to go back on the street to arrest somebody they could have arrested in a county jail.\nWhen some law enforcement agencies fail to honor detainers or release serious criminal offenders, they -- it undermines ICE's ability to protect public safety and carry out its mission. Most work with us, but many don't in the largest cities, and that is where criminal aliens and criminal gangs flourish. It is safer for everyone if we take custody of an alien in a controlled environment of another law enforcement agency as opposed to visiting an alien's residence, place of work, or other public area. Arresting a criminal in the safety, security, and privacy of the jail is the right thing to do.\nBeyond the issue of sanctuary jurisdictions, the two executive orders signed by the President earlier this year have finally allowed my officers to do what they do best: uphold the integrity of our borders and our immigration system by enforcing the laws as they were written.\nICE's job is to execute a mission within framework provided us, that framework meaning laws, policies, and executive orders. Our job and our sworn duty is to enforce the laws of this country. The current numbers show that the executive orders and the policies are working. Immigration and illegal crossings on the border has significantly decreased. No one can argue that.\nWhat many people don't realize is ICE is comprised of three major law enforcement arms. I want to talk briefly about them. The Enforcement and Removal Operations referred to -- ERO, Homeland Security Investigations, known as HSI, and the third enforcement program is ICE Attorney cores, Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, OPLA.\nThe mission of ICE's ERO is to identify, arrest, and remove aliens who present a danger to national security, our public risk, public safety risk, and a risk to border security. ICE conducts targeted enforcement operations in compliance with federal law and regulation. We do not conduct sweeps, raids, roadblocks -- this is important to know. This is a targeted enforcement operation, which means we look for a specific person at a specific location based on intelligence and criminal investigative work. They're not raids. They're not sweeps.\nHowever, as Secretary Kelly has made clear, no class or category of removable aliens is exempt from enforcement. As you may know, since the President's executive orders on immigration enforcement were signed, we have arrested nearly 66,000 persons that were either known or suspected to be in the country illegally. Forty-eight thousand of those were convicted criminal aliens. Therefore, 73 percent -- 73 percent -- of everyone we have arrested were criminals, something that's been lost in the messaging on immigration enforcement.\nAs for Homeland Security Investigation, ICE special agents, officers, and attorneys enforce provisions of approximately 400 statutes. ICE is very focused on breaking up gangs and transnational smuggling organizations by identifying, arresting, and prosecuting them, along with removing those that are illegally in the United States.\nSince the beginning of January, HSI has already arrested 3,311 gang members across the country in a number of targeted operations. Project New Dawn, a recent gang surge led by HSI, netted 1,378 arrests. Operation Matador in New York recently arrested 39 MS-13 gang members.\nIn closing, as the executive orders make clear, ICE is ordered to faithfully execute the nation's immigration laws. Through a sustained commitment to enforcement, illegal immigration will come down and has come down. When people ask us not to arrest those who are not serious criminals I say this: Those who enter our country illegally violated our country's laws. It's a crime to enter this country illegally -- 8 U.S.C. 1325, illegal entry into the United States.\nThe moment law enforcement starts carving out exemptions is the moment the rule of law starts to erode. Again, ICE prioritizes those that are a threat to national security and public safety. But prioritization doesn't mean others that violated our laws are off the table and should be ignored. I personally have been enforcing immigration law for 33 years. The two pieces of legislation we'll be discussing later today are the most significant pieces of immigration enforcement legislation I've seen in my entire career.\nThis legislation will help the fine men and women of the Border Patrol and ICE to do their job in securing the border, enforcing the immigration laws within the interior of the United States, and make our nation and our communities safer as a result. America deserves that. Law enforcement is a dangerous job, we all know that. This legislation and its effects will also help protect the law enforcement officers that work at ICE and the Border Patrol. And those officers that leave their families every day to enforce the laws of this great nation deserve that.\nWith that I'll turn it over to the Department of Justice.\nMR. HUBER: Transnational gang members and criminal alien drug traffickers are a significant source of violent crime in the United States. Just last month in Utah, a federal judge issued a sentence of life in prison plus 80 years to Roberto Roman. Roberto Roman, prior to 2010, had been removed from our country no less than three times. He had served a stint in state prison for drug trafficking. And regardless, that was not enough to dissuade him from coming back to our country and selling methamphetamine to addicted persons in rural Utah.\nIt was in January of 2010 that Deputy Josie Greathouse Fox -- the first patrol deputy in the history of rural Millard County, Utah -- was working with her partners late at night to interdict drug trafficking in the wide-open spaces of Utah. She intercepted Roberto Roman's Cadillac on a lonely highway in the west desert of Utah. Roberto Roman is an amoral criminal who had no intention to follow the laws of the United States. Without warning and without remorse, he pulled up his AK-47 style semi-automatic rifle and gunned down Deputy Fox in the middle of the road. He left her to die there.\nIn a different case, in 2011, in the pristine Dixie National Forest of southern Utah, Mexican cartels had set up an illegal marijuana farm, out of sight and hopefully out of mind of law enforcement. Apparently to help with operational security, the cartel had recruited members of MS-13, three members, who were found with firearms, multiple firearms, protecting the site. In 2011, a federal judge in Utah issued 15-year sentences to each of the three defendants for their role in the crime.\nAlthough Utah has not suffered violence at the hands of MS-13 like occurs in California and here in the states of the East, their influence is creeping ever closer to Utah, where I live. Even still, if MS-13 is not the common-day problem, other transnational gangs are. Take, for example, the Surenos gangs that plague us in Utah. These transnational drug-trafficking organizations and criminal gangs have an outsized influence on the public safety in Utah.\nI am a career prosecutor and I'm at the beginning of my third year as a United States attorney, which makes me, presently, one of the longest-tenured U.S. attorneys serving. And both as a line prosecutor and as a lead prosecutor, I have dutifully served both Democrat and Republican administrations. Utah perennially leads the interior states and districts in criminal alien prosecutions. Every year, we prosecute hundreds of federal felony cases.\nNow to be clear, these are criminal aliens -- drug traffickers, gang members, domestic violence abusers, human traffickers, child exploiters. From my perspective, in Utah, where it should be a presumptively safe mountain haven, criminal aliens significantly impact our quality of life by exposing our nation to unwarranted risk of violence.\nThat is why Attorney General Sessions has directed myself and my colleagues as U.S. attorneys to prioritize these cases in our prosecutions. If it's a problem in Utah -- and it is; 40 percent of my caseload, my felony caseload in Utah are criminal alien prosecutions. If it's a problem in Utah, it's a problem for the nation. Law enforcement officers and prosecutors need more tools and unfettered coordination to address the challenge.\nSo this pending legislation -- Kate's Law on one hand and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act on the other hand -- advance the ball for law enforcement in keeping our communities safe. The laws, if passed, would give officers and prosecutors more tools to protect the public. Stiffer penalties for reentry offenders make sense. It just does.\nThe status quo is not deterring the criminals from returning. As an example, just today in Salt Lake City, my office initiated one more prosecution in what is projected to be over 300 felony prosecutions this year against a criminal alien. This defendant's record indicates that he has been convicted four times for drug trafficking. He has been convicted two times for unlawfully reentering the United States after deportation. And, well, he's back in Utah, and what do you know -- in 2017 he was arrested yet again for drug trafficking.\nKate's Law enhances our ability to stem the tide of criminals who seem to almost always return to victimize us. On the other hand, moving unnatural impediments between local and federal law enforcement will enable coordination that we need to keep our country and our neighborhoods safe. The priority for public safety overrides and wins out against what these so-called sanctuary policies promise.\nWe don't gamble with our public safety. Criminal aliens don't need encouragement to reside in our beautiful cities. Criminal aliens warrant handcuffs and removal. Law enforcement professionals are very good at what they do, and we should not impede them from their excellent work in keeping us safe.\nThank you. We can take a few questions on these topics if you'd like.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Specifically, could you tell us what you could do if these laws become passed and approved by the President that you can't do now? What would enlarge your capabilities that you don't possess now?\nMR. HUBER: Case law -- the gist of case is that it raises the maximum penalties for criminals who reenter our country. And it's a graded formula as it's presently drafted. So the more you have on your criminal record, or the more times you've been deported and reentered, the higher the penalties would be.\nNow, that is a message that is sent -- if Congress passes this, it's sent to the executive branch that these are priority cases and they're important. So as high as 25-year maximum for one of these crimes, depending on your record, sends a message to me that that's a priority for the nation. It also sends a message to the judicial branch, to the judges that the more these people commit crimes in our communities, the more often they come back, the more serious the penalties will be.\nQ: Anything else that -- you talked about tools to improve law enforcement. That's just a penalty after a crime has been committed. I'm just curious if there's anything operationally that's different or that would be different under these two laws?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: Well, under the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act law, there's just specific actions -- specific thing that changes for us. The new legislation bans any restriction on compliance and cooperation with ICE. The new legislation makes it clear that state and local law enforcement cannot be precluded from asking immigrants their status. Any jurisdiction -- a violating jurisdiction can be limited from receiving grants from the Department of Homeland Security or DOJ.\nI think this new No Sanctuary for Criminals Act will bring more law enforcement agencies to the table to accept our detainers. It also -- there's a piece of this legislation that if that jurisdiction gets sued for honoring our detainees, the government will take on that lawsuit. So we provide immunity from lawsuits for following the detainer guidance.\nThat's what my biggest concern is. For the jurisdictions that don't believe they're going to honor our detainers, we think -- DOJ and DHS thinks our detainers are legally defensible. The lawsuits that have been pending in the past few years were a different form. They didn't require probable cause, didn't accompany a warrant of arrest; the new detainer form does.\nSo this is what I'm here today to talk about because those criminals that walk out of jails without ICE's attention are going to reoffend. Recidivism rates -- if you look it up it's between 45 percent to 70 percent, depending on the crime -- they're going to reoffend. That's a public safety issue and that's an officer safety issue. For every alien that I can't arrest in a county jail, one of my officers have to knock on the door. That's unfair. It's dangerous and we can prevent this.\nI think all law enforcement wants to work together to keep our community safe.\nQ: I have a question, gentlemen. Can I ask you about the Kate Steinle circumstance? In your experience, can you sort of crystalize for us what that story, what that crime meant to you and why the American people should, frankly, rally behind this if you feel like this is something that they should be talking to their lawmakers about? That particular story seemed to captivate a great many people in our country and I just want to draw on your experience from that story and why that is also why you're here today.\nMR. HUBER: Kate Steinle and other cases like it are great motivators to us. And we can't bring her back. She's gone because of the hands of a criminal alien who was released rather than being handed over, according to lawful process, to federal law enforcement. What a tragedy that was. And if we can plug that hole through efforts like these bills try to advance, then that improves our society.\nIt's a great motivator. And to name it after her immortalizes the sacrifice that she made to bring this issue to our minds. I don't know where you stand on the political spectrum, but to have someone who should have been in jail, who had a lawful process requiring him to be in jail but is let out for some philosophical reason, and then to lose a dear family member -- it just doesn't make sense.\nQ: Was that AK-47 bought legally?\nMR. HUBER: AK-47 -- any firearm cannot be possessed legally by an illegal alien. So just him possessing him the firearm --\nQ: -- traced it back to the source?\nMR. HUBER: As soon as he took possession of a firearm, or -- any alien, whether they have a criminal record or not, cannot lawfully possesses a firearm.\nQ: But was it traced back to the source of where he got the AK-47?\nMR. HUBER: We've -- yeah, he traded that -- he traded drugs for that gun, which is a crime also. And that's part of his life-plus-80 sentence. You can't do that.\nQ: Can I get you to also respond to the Kate Steinle question, if you wouldn't mind?\nQ: Let me ask you a -- I'd like to find out more. When it comes to -- thank you. When it comes to not just enforcement of sanctuary cities but, for example, a border wall, I'm wondering, based on your expertise, do you believe that a physical border wall would have stopped, for example, the death of Kate Steinle, or other of these crimes that we're seeing victims from immigrants?\nMR. HUBER: As with many of our public safety challenges in the United States, they're multifaceted and they're complicated. Attorney General Sessions has made it clear that keeping people out in the first place is one way to solve or put off the problem. They still make it to Utah. Regardless of the security we have in place right now on the border, they make it to Utah by the hundreds and victimize us.\nQ: And my second question to you -- this is clearly a message that you think is important. You're here talking with us in the briefing room. Do you believe this would have been more effective to do on camera so you could get your message out directly to the American people?\nMR. HUBER: That's something for the White House to answer. I've not a position on that.\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: I'd like to respond to your question on the Kay Steinle thing. Kay Steinle's case kind of put this front and center, right? But this happens every day across the country.\nJust this morning I looked at the statistics. In FY12 -- compared to FY12 to FY16 with this whole detainer litigation and the sanctuary city issues, we issued 196,000 less detainers in FY16 than we did in FY12. I could sit here for the next three hours and talk about cases of aliens that we put detainers on in these sanctuary cities. I'll give you one -- I read one this morning. Someone gets arrested for domestic violence. We put a detainer on him. That's not honored. He gets out. He kills the victim of domestic violence.\nI can go on and on about the number of DUIs -- of aliens convicted of DUIs, arrested for DUIs we put detainers on. They go out and reoffend -- I read this morning killed a 12-year-old boy on a skateboard. This happens every day across this country. And that's why this is so important to us.\nOn the border wall, the border wall is one tool to help control the border. And I hear a lot of times, well, the numbers are down, why build a border wall -- why not? We're talking about securing this country, and a border wall is one tool. You're still going to need men and women on the border. You're still going to need border enforcement agents. You're still going to need a true interior enforcement strategy and enforcement of the laws in the interior. But I have homeowner's insurance, but I never used it. But it's to ensure the security of this country.\nSo that border wall I think is a necessary tool in a whole toolbox of how we control the border and protect this country.\nQ: Sir, aren't you concerned though about exacerbating fears about undocumented immigrants? You're making it sound as if undocumented immigrants commit more crimes than people who are just native-born Americans. There was a Cato Institute study put out in March of this year that says all immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans relative to their shares of the population; even illegal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans. What is your sense of the numbers on this? Are undocumented people more likely or less likely to commit crimes?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: I think you're misinterpreting what I'm saying. What I'm saying is two things. Number one, people that enter this country illegally violate the laws of this country. You can't want to be a part of this great nation and not respect its laws. So when you violate the laws of this country -- and the taxpayers in this country spend billions of dollars a year on border security, immigration court, detention. And they go through a process. They get a decision from the immigration judge -- most times will appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, then to a circuit court. When that due process is over, that final order from a federal judge needs to mean something or this whole system has no integrity.\nI don't know what other federal agency in this country is told to ignore a federal judge's order from a bench. We are simply doing our job. Did I say aliens commit more crimes than U.S. citizens? I didn't say that. I'm saying, number one, they're in the country illegally. They're in the country -- they already committed one crime by entering the country illegally. But when they commit a crime against a citizen of this country, they draw our attention.\nAs far as fear in the immigrant community, I testified a couple weeks ago and I get a lot of media saying, well, you're instilling fear in the immigrant community. My purpose is to dispel the notion that if you enter this country illegally and violate the laws of this nation, you should not be comfortable. None of us in this room would be comfortable if we go speeding down a highway. We're going to think, maybe I'll get a ticket. If you lie on your taxes you may get audited. Well, if you enter this country illegally, you should be concerned that someone is looking for you. You should be concerned because you violated the laws of this country.\nQ: And nobody wants to excuse lawbreaking, but what do you do with a family where a mother brings her children across the border, she has committed a crime in your view at that point by crossing the border illegally, she's in this country with her two young children, those children grow up, become the so-called DREAMers in this country. Do you deport the mother and separate the mother from the family? Because what you're saying -- if you look at this from a cold and clinical standpoint, what you're saying is because the mother crossed the border illegally, committed a crime, that she should be separated from her children. What do you say to that?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: Well, I got to tell you --\nQ: You're not setting policy here. You're here to talk about enforcement.\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: I'm here -- I'm here to --\nQ: But that enforcement has real impacts on people's lives.\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: U.S. citizen families get separated every day when a parent or when a parent gets arrested for a criminal charge. So those here illegally, they put themselves in that position.\nSo when it comes to separating families, when someone chooses to enter this country illegally and they're here illegally and they choose to have a child that's a U.S. citizen, they've put themselves in that position, not the U.S. government, not the ICE officers. So, again, we're enforcing the law.\nLook, if we don't have border security, if we don't enforce the laws that's written in the books, you're never going to control the border. Why do you think we got 11 million to 12 million people in this country now? Because there has been this notion that if you get by the Border Patrol, you get in the United States, you have a U.S. citizen kid, no one is looking for you. But those days are over.\nQ: So you should arrest the mothers, go after the mothers?\nQ: Sir, is that the message from this White House, you standing at this podium today that if you are an undocumented immigrant in this country right now listening to you that you should be fearful, that you should be concerned, you should be looking over your shoulder that ICE is looking for you?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: Well, you're losing the message.\nQ: No, I want to make sure that that's what the message is.\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: No, I'm saying -- let me just say it again. ICE prioritizes our enforcement efforts on national security threats, public safety threats, those who have been ordered removed by a judge and failed to depart, and those who have been ordered removed, were removed, and reentered the country -- which is -- the legislation is about -- that's a felony when you reenter the country after removal. That's what I'm saying. That's our priorities.\nHowever, what I'm saying, during the course of those operations if we find someone here illegally, we're not going to turn the other way. We're going to put them in front of a judge. They're going to have their due process and let the criminal justice system work the way it's been designed.\nAgain, we're enforcing the laws enacted by Congress and signed by the President. ICE officers, U.S. attorneys don't make these laws up. Our job is to execute the laws of the country.\nQ: Do you believe that that should apply to children who are brought here illegally, the DREAMers?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: I think the administration has been clear that the deferred action for childhood arrivals, they still have deferred action. And the only DACA people that I know have been arrested are those that violated our policy by committing crime.\nQ: Do you agree with that policy, that they should be allowed to stay?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: That's above my pay grade.\nMR. HUBER: Yes, ma'am.\nQ: Yes, okay, so a question. Several of the families that have lost loved ones to illegal alien crime are here today at the White House. And one of the things that I wanted to ask is, a lot them have issues of this alien was convicted of DUI twice and was still here and then hit my child, and then even then only served like 35 days in jail after that offense that killed her child -- Sabina Durden is that one. What about prosecutorial discretion? I hear a lot of Border Patrol agents talk about the issue of catch and release, and that these -- like drug crimes are not -- they use prosecutorial discretion and then like don't actually bring those cases?\nMR. HUBER: We are very motivated. And with the leadership in the Department of Justice from Attorney General Sessions, we are mandated to make these cases a priority. My heart goes out to the victims of these crimes. And we can't go backwards in time, but we can learn the lessons and move forward.\nIn the words of the Attorney General, the times for drug traffickers and gang members to target us need to turn. And the Department of Justice is committed to targeting them on our terms. And that is where the instruction to me comes from.\nQ: And can I just give you a follow-up? You mentioned Kate's Law, you mentioned this other sanctuary cities law. Do you think the sanctuary cities law that you talked about is strong enough? And also what about Grant's Law and Sarah's Law?\nMR. HUBER: Well, one adage in our society is don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. These bills advance the ball for law enforcement.\nAnd with your question about victims and their families, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, if passed, provides an avenue for them to hold accountable noncompliant cities or counties for their decisions that endangered them.\nQ: Sir, you have a piece in here talking about gangs. And the President has been talking about gangs since he's been here at the White House. Is there anything in Kate's Law that once you I guess handcuff the criminal repeat offender, criminal aliens -- is there a piece in Kate's Law that works also to break the backs of the gangs that you have pointed out?\nMR. HUBER: We are committed to dismantle gangs, criminal gangs. What Kate's Law does is give us one more tool that is fairly easy to use, because we're not reliant upon witnesses who may be intimidated by the gangs or victimized by the gangs. This enables us to, based on a person's status and their criminal record and their deportation record, to simply prosecute them in federal court, obtain a prison sentence, and get them out of here. That is one more tool for us to fight the gangs back.\nQ: So but does this also allow for tentacles to go in to find out more information about the gang activity? You get this one person who could be a component, who could be selling drugs with the gang. Is there any kind of tentacle or piece that will allow you to do what the President wants, to break the backs of the gang once you infiltrate and get someone who is part of a gang?\nMR. HUBER: This is one more tool in my toolbox. And the great special agents and local law enforcement officers who develop those leads and work their way up to the top of the chain so that we can dismantle these gangs organizationally, this is one more tool that will help us do that.\nQ: Director Homan, you said -- you're talking about a tool kit and you're talking about the border wall being part of the momentum of being able to deal with this issue. A lot of people on the other side have said that comprehensive immigration reform might be a way to ease some of these stresses. What do you think about comprehensive immigration reform as a tool in your tool kit?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: I think -- look, I think Congress enacts laws and they pass laws. I think there's always room for discussion. I've certainly been around a long time.\nI want to follow up on something earlier -- the gentleman mentioned \"cold,\" and people think I'm standing up here and I'm the devil. Let me make something clear: Why am I so strong about this? I've been doing 33 years. I started in the Border Patrol. I was an investigator for 20 years. I climbed the ladder. If you saw what I saw the last 33 years, I wouldn't get half the bad media that we get.\nPeople weren't with me when I found dead aliens on a trail that were abandoned by smugglers. People were not with me when I was in Phoenix, Arizona seeing these people being held hostage and their smuggling rates being doubled; the families couldn't pay them so women were raped, children were molested, or the smuggled alien was killed at the hands of these organizations. People weren't with me in Victoria, Texas when I stood in the back of a tractor trailer with 19 dead aliens, with a five-year-old that died in his father's arms because he suffocated to death. How do you think that five-year-old felt his last 10 minutes of his life looking at his father that couldn't help him, or his father looking at his child that's dying in his arms, can't help him?\nThese organizations are callous. They're transnational, criminal organizations. So the people that move these immigrants that come here for a better life are the same ones that move criminal aliens, are the same ones that moves -- they smuggle weapons, they smuggle dope, and they can smuggle people that can come to this country to do us harm.\nSo the more we endorse the non-enforcement of immigration laws, we bankroll these organizations.\nQ: But back to that question about immigration reform and a path to citizenship, this has been one of the really big issues and it cuts across party lines. Do you think that having a path to citizenship and creating sort of a more rational process, in the minds of some opponents of this policy, would be helpful from an enforcement perspective?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: I'll say this. Generally if we reward illegal behavior, why would that illegal behavior ever stop? If people think they can enter this country illegally, get by the Border Patrol, the fine men and women of the Border Patrol -- I was in the Border Patrol. They're a great organization. But if you get by the Border Patrol and you hide in the United States long enough that you get something in the end? That's just a magnet to bring more illegal immigration. I think this administration is doing the right thing.\nThey have put true consequence and deterrence on illegal, unlawful activity. And if you see the numbers on what's going on on the border, it is working. The numbers are the lowest they've been in a long, long time. And we've got to continue this pace.\nQ: I just want to nail down -- I think I heard the answer to this in one of your answers, but how many illegal immigrants do you believe are in this country?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: I see the same estimates you see -- 11 [million] to 12 million.\nQ: Do you give any credence to the notion that there's 30 million illegal immigrants in the country?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: I never heard that figure.\nQ: It's something the President Trump said on the campaign trail a lot last year. I'm just wondering if you think there's any truth to it.\nQ: President Trump uses that figure.\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: The number I have always seen is 11 [million] to 12 million.\nQ: Director, what do you say to some taxpayers who might agree with this bill on its substance but who are concerned that ultimately it's going to cost them more money? According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, it's going to balloon the federal annual prison deficit by at least $2 billion and increase the number of people who are in prison by 57,000. What do you say to those concerns?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: I'd say what cost do you put on making communities safer? What cost do you put on actually securing your border? I mean, this administration -- their policies are working. Their numbers are down on the border. We have better control of the border than we've ever had. Look at the numbers. Numbers speak for themselves.\nSo I think -- what cost do you put on national security and border safety and community safety? I think that's a question they'd have to answer.\nQ: Do you think the message you just shared with us here would be of interest to the viewing public if the viewing public was allowed to view it on-camera?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: That what, sir?\nQ: Your message was strong. We hear it. Do you think it would be of interest to the viewing public if it was allowed to be viewed by the public on cameras?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: I have no problem meeting with any congressional rep that wants to sit down and talk to me, any media person that wants to sit down and talk to me. I think the message needs to get out. I think what we're trying to do here -- and the statement I made is we need to send a clear message that if you violate the laws of this country you need to be held accountable, you need to be concerned. Because this notion that it's okay to violate laws of this country and be comfortable thinking there's going to be no enforcement activity -- that's not the America I grew up in, and that's not the America we should have.\nQ: And that's what -- want to get out to the public, but yet the cameras aren't rolling.\nQ: Director, would you support allowing victims of illegal aliens to sue the city officials of sanctuary cities?\nMS. SANDERS: We'll let this be the last question.\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: Yes.\nQ: Would you support allowing victims of criminal aliens and sanctuary cities to sue the city officials?\nDIRECTOR HOMAN: For those who make the decisions to release those alien citizens to the street, yes.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you, guys, very much. Just to be clear, I know it's been asked a couple of times about their availability to be on camera. I believe the plan is that they will go to the sticks shortly after we conclude and be happy to take a few of your questions on camera. My guess is if they had stood here, though, you probably wouldn't have covered them like they were Secretary Perry, Secretary Shulkin when they opened the briefing just a few days -- yesterday. A couple of weeks ago, multiple networks didn't cover those openings, so hopefully you guys will take the opportunity at the sticks and be sure to cover that.\nObviously this issue is something that the President spoke about very passionately on the campaign trail. And given the fact that this legislation has 80 percent approval around the country, the President looks forward to seeing Congressman Goodlatte's bills pass with bipartisan support.\nIn regards to the rest of the President's schedule for today, he continued Energy Week this morning by hosting a roundtable with tribal, state, and local leaders. As Secretary Perry told you all yesterday, the Trump administration is looking to create an energy-dominant America. An energy-dominant America will bring even more hard-working Americans into the high-skill, well-paying jobs and careers the energy sector offers. When we can export American energy to markets around the world, the President will also be able to use it as an important tool to increase our global leadership and influence, advancing our global agenda and helping to keep our citizens safe.\nBefore I take your questions, I wanted to highlight Samsung's announcement this morning that it will be investing nearly $400 million in a new plant in South Carolina that is expected to create nearly 1,000 local jobs by 2020. This is big news for the residents of Newberry County. As Secretary Ross said this morning, it's another sign that President Trump -- America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses to look and grow.\nWith that, I will take your questions. Kristen.\nQ: Sarah, thanks so much. I want to just be clear on where the administration stands right now on Syria. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said earlier today, \"I can tell you due to the President's action, we did not see an incident.\"\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, we did not see --\nQ: \"We did not see an incident.\" Is the sense that the threat from Bashar al Assad at least right now is over? That he's no longer planning an imminent chemical weapons attack?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I can't get into specific intelligence matters. I think that the action that the U.S. took was successful.\nQ: And did the President ever consider taking preemptive military action, or was that statement the only thing that was on the table this week?\nMS. SANDERS: I know that was the action decided. I'm not, of course, going to go into detailed conversations that may have taken place or may not have taken place. I know that there have been, actually, a lot of questions about the timeline regarding Syria. I know several of you in the room have asked about that.\nSo, Kristen, to be clear, I'd be happy to walk you through, step-by-step, exactly how that process unfolded. There were a lot of stories about the process not working or relevant agencies and people being out of the loop. Those are simply false.\nAt a regularly scheduled meeting, as I mentioned yesterday, the President was presented with information that indicated the Assad regime was preparing another chemical weapons attack. The President proposed issuing a statement to warn the regime of consequences. Senior administration officials, including NSA McMaster, DNI Director Coats, and DCI Pompeo were present when the statement was initially proposed. They and their teams remained in the loop throughout the drafting process. Secretaries Tillerson and Mattis remained in the loop and were consulted in-person later that day. The military chain of command was also fully aware of the statement as it was being prepared and later released. Secretary Tillerson also spoke to his Russian counterpart, and Lieutenant General Townsend engaged his Russian counterpart in Syria.\nThe White House staff secretary's office reviewed the statement and coordinated it with White House leadership. And over the next few hours, the White House staff secretary used its typical coordination process to solicit comments from all relevant departments and agencies. By the time the statement was issued, every relevant department and agency had ample opportunity to provide feedback and input.\nAs the President stated on April 6th, the use of chemical weapons threatens U.S. vital national interest, and the statement was clear and reinforces this message. We have seen indications that the Syrian regime is preparing -- was preparing a major chemical attack, and the President warned the regime of consequences should they proceed.\nQ: Just one more quick follow-up. Is the use of chemical weapons the President's only red line when it comes to Syria?\nMS. SANDERS: As we've said many times before, the President is never going to broadcast the decisions on matters like that.\nQ: But he does see that as a red line, the use of chemical weapons?\nMS. SANDERS: I think he's been clear on his position. Kevin.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I want to ask you about the Kate Steinle announcement here today. Is her father by chance going to be among the guests? I know that -- at least when we came out here -- I hadn't seen a list. And secondarily, because you know that story very well, what does it mean to you to see the administration get to this point? And I'd like to ask you a follow-up.\nMS. SANDERS: On the first part, I don't believe that they are here but I will double check and let you know. But as far I'm aware at this point, not that I know of. I think any time we can take a step in protecting Americans, it's a great step forward in the process.\nQ: And also, if I could ask you about -- yesterday you had a day to sort of look back. Did you go to the gym and hit the heavy bag? Did you laugh it off? Many of us have covered multiple administrations and you hear worse, you see worse. I'm just wondering what you were thinking and feeling a day later.\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the White House had a great day yesterday, Kevin.\nQ: Thank you. If the GOP healthcare plan fails, is the plan B really to let Obamacare implode? What's plan B for you guys?\nMS. SANDERS: We're focused on plan A, and that is repealing and replacing Obamacare. The President is fully engaged as -- along with his administration in working with House and Senate members to make sure that we repeal and replace Obamacare and put in place a healthcare reform system that is sustainable and that works and serves all Americans. And that's the focus right now, and that's the only focus.\nQ: And I know you've seen the criticisms -- and part of the criticism that's been out there is that the President has not been fully engaged on this one. Your response to that, and if you could detail his level of engagement for us.\nMS. SANDERS: Again, as I just said, the President's been very engaged in this process, as have multiple members of his administration. And he's made a lot of calls directly to members. He had roughly I think 46 members of the Senate here yesterday. They had a long and lengthy and very good and productive conversation. We're going to continue doing that, just like he was with the House. He was engaged and making sure that happened. And he's somebody -- as we've said before, I would never underestimate this President, and if he's committed to getting something done he will.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sarah. You said yesterday during the briefing that the President was optimistic about getting passage for the Senate healthcare bill. As you know, there are at least nine Republican senators that have come out opposed to the healthcare bill as it's now structured. What gives the President reason for optimism given the way it looks to most people is perhaps a reason for pessimism?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's really simple. Look, Republicans have been talking about doing this for a number of years, and they're committed to getting it done. And this is part of the process. This is one of the reasons we've never been focused on a timeline of having to get it done on a certain day, by a certain holiday or anything else. It's about getting it done right.\nAnd the President, as you know, again, sat down with a lot of those members that you're referencing yesterday. Those same people are committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare and putting something in that actually works. They're committed to doing that, and that's what we're focused on. That's what we're going to make sure happens.\nFrancesca.\nQ: During that Q&A session, that meeting with those Republican senators, did the President hear anything from those opposed to the Senate healthcare bill that leads him to believe that they will change their minds as it relates to this legislation?\nMS. SANDERS: I think he heard -- again, like I just said -- what all of Americans have been hearing all of these members talk about is that this is something that has to happen. Obamacare is simply not sustainable. Even Democrats have recognized that. And our path forward is to repeal and replace it. It's very simple.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Sarah, you mentioned the meeting yesterday with the 46 members of Congress. I believe you said also yesterday that he talked to four on the telephone. We know that Rand Paul was here. He had a meeting with GOP leaders about this. Is there anything else that the President was doing? I ask this specifically because Susan Collins had mentioned that they -- that she feels that there could have been more personal engagement before this point in time. And I'm wondering if the President could have done more, if you think the President could have done more, should have done more, and what he's going to be doing moving forward to get this across the finish line?\nQ: I mean, I think you're talking about it as if it's over, and it's certainly not. I mean, again, this is part of the process, is walking through. We've said from the beginning that there were going to be changes that would probably take place within this piece of legislation. That's where we are.\nAgain, the President has been directly engaged and will continue to be so.\nQ: Sure. On another topic, I want to ask you about an NPR and Marist poll that came out today. One of the questions they asked was about the President's tweeting. Sixty-nine percent of Americans said that they found it distracting and it wasn't helpful. I know that you guys have said repeatedly that you think that the President is the best, the most effective messenger, and that you think the tweeting helps. What do you -- where are you guys getting that from when you see polls like this that say that a majority of Americans think that it's a distraction?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't seen the poll that you're referencing but I do know that the President speaking directly to the American people is always a good thing. No matter who the President is, that's a positive no matter what.\nFor the people to hear directly from their President, no matter what format that is in -- whether it's through social media platforms, whether it's through speeches, whether it's through interviews -- that's always a positive. And I think most people agree.\nQ: The President, as we all know, is having an event tonight at his hotel. Is he running for reelection?\nMS. SANDERS: Of course he's running for reelection. I think it would be -- but right now, he's focused on his agenda, focused on the midterms. That will be the first election. He's raising money for the party. I don't think that's abnormal for any President.\nQ: We'd appreciate it if you could open that event up to coverage tonight?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll be sure to pass that on.\nMara.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. You've focused a lot on the problems in the Obamacare exchanges and said today again that this situation is unsustainable. Does the President believe that Medicaid in its current form is unsustainable?\nMS. SANDERS: I know that the plan as of right now and certainly in the most recent draft of the bill is to make sure that Medicaid is protected.\nQ: In its current form?\nMS. SANDERS: In its current form, that anybody who is currently on wouldn't lose coverage.\nQ: But what about in the future? Because this plan drastically changes Medicaid, which actually is a bigger chunk of the healthcare delivery system than the Obamacare exchanges?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think that's -- again, part of this process is working through that and figuring out the best way to provide medical care.\nQ: Does he want changes in the Medicaid portion of the bill?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of, but I would have to speak directly to him. I just don't know the answer to that directly.\nQ: Sarah, Paul Manafort, who was for a time the general chairman of the campaign, and Rick Gates who was a figure in the campaign and also the presidential inaugural committee, have registered retroactively as representatives of a foreign government to retroactively comply with a law which they were not in compliance with. Does the White House regret that they were not in compliance with the law when they were working on behalf of candidate Trump or the inaugural committee? Do you have any reaction to the fact that they're now trying to retroactively do something they should have done long, long ago?\nMS. SANDERS: I certainly can't speak for the campaign. I'm here solely as a representative of the White House, and that would be a campaign matter. And I couldn't speak to that.\nQ: Let me ask you about healthcare. Yesterday, Senator Paul after his meeting with the President didn't say directly, but he left the impression that part of their conversation was for Senator Paul to express that he didn't believe the current draft fully repeals the Affordable Care Act, and that's one of his grievances. And he left the impression that the President might agree with him on that. So I want to ask you directly: Does the President believe that one of the flaws with the current draft is that it does not go far enough to repeal the Affordable Care Act?\nMS. SANDERS: I wasn't part of that conversation. I would be happy to ask that question and follow up with you maybe.\nJordan.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. There's a lot of changes being floated out there -- changes to Medicaid, changes to U.S. coverage requirements. Is there a change that's being proposed that would be a nonstarter for President Trump that would be a deal-breaker, that if it was included he wouldn't put his signature on the bill?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sure that there are things. I mean, there's a lot of crazy things I'm sure that could be suggested that would be deal-breakers for all of the Senate. But we haven't sat down and made a list of deal-breakers. If we have, I'm not aware of it. But I can certainly ask if there is one and circle back.\nJennifer. Jennifer.\nQ: Thank you. Sarah, at the State Department, the positions of Special Envoy to Combat Anti-Semitism and the Ambassador for International Religious Freedom have -- they remain vacant. It's my understanding that the special envoy position is going to expire or be empty in a few days. This as anti-Semitism and religious persecution, of course, worldwide is on the rise. These are values the President routinely raises. Is this a missed opportunity? Does the White House or does the State Department plan to fill these positions? What's going on here?\nMS. SANDERS: I mean, I think certainly one of the biggest missed opportunities is the ability for us to staff across the board. We have seen obstruction like never before. The average time that it's taking for us to get somebody through the process and confirmed is significantly longer than any historical precedent by several weeks.\nWe have nearly a hundred people in the queue that are waiting to be pushed through. And due to the lengthy process and the obstruction by Democrats, that's held up a number of positions not just at the State Department, but across the federal government. Hopefully we can get those positions filled. And certainly I would imagine those would be on that list.\nQ: Two things -- to follow up on a question earlier. Why is the White House choosing to keep the President's remarks at the fundraiser tonight closed to the press?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that's been tradition. And as you're shaking --\nQ: Only in private homes.\nMS. SANDERS: -- that's actually not true. There were actually quite a few instances during both of the two previous administrations not to open up fundraisers. If that changes, I'll certainly --\nQ: But we go -- the pool goes in at the time.\nQ: But what is this administration's explanation for why that's necessary?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's a political event and they've chosen to keep that separate for the time being.\nQ: And then I also wanted to ask you about one of the President's tweets earlier today when he talked about The Washington Post and Amazon, referring to Amazon not paying Internet taxes, he says, which they should. What was the President referring to?\nMS. SANDERS: I'd have to check on that. I haven't had a chance to talk to him about it.\nHallie.\nQ: Thank you. I have two for you. One on healthcare, the President in the West Wing here was talking about Senator Chuck Schumer. He says that he's done a lot of bad talking and doesn't seem like a serious person. There's some discussion on the Hill that there needs to be a bipartisan solution with healthcare. So given those comments about Senator Schumer, who presumably would have to come to the table, is the President abandoning Democratic cooperation?\nMS. SANDERS: I think Democrats abandoned the ability when they said that they were unwilling to come to the table and have, frankly, refused to be part of the conversation from the beginning. And I think they set that tone and certainly set that standard by not participating, by not wanting to be part of the process.\nThanks so much, guys.\nEND 2:32 P.M.

Trump\nTAKING ACTION TO COMBAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: For too long, politicians across the country have failed to enforce the immigration laws already on the books.\n* Just months in office, President Donald J. Trump is keeping his promises to the American people and taking action to enforce our country's immigration laws.\n* President Trump's policies have already had an impact, with 64 percent fewer apprehensions and inadmissible entries at the southwest border compared to the same time last year.\n* In the first 100 days after President Trump signed Executive Orders on immigration enforcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has seen nearly 40 percent more Enforcement and Removal Operations compared to the same time last year.\n* Nearly 75 percent of these illegal aliens have been convicted criminals with offenses ranging from homicide and assault to sexual abuse and drug-related charges.\n* Arrests of convicted criminal aliens climbed by nearly 20 percent in this time compared to the same time last year.\n* In fiscal year 2017, ICE has removed 2,798 criminal gang members, compared to 2,057 criminal gang members in all of fiscal year 2016.\n* ICE has specifically targeted MS-13 criminal gang members for removal on immigration violations.\n* President Trump has acted to strengthen the country's ability to enforce the laws and stop illegal aliens at the border:\n* He has directed the hiring of 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents and 10,000 ICE agents.\n* He has ordered the construction of a wall on the southern border and prioritized funds in his budget to begin its construction.\nSUPPORTING LEGISLATION TO ENFORCE OUR LAWS: President Trump is supporting legislation in Congress that begins to address sanctuary cities and aliens who repeatedly enter our country in violation of our laws.\n* President Trump supports the passage of the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003).\n* According to a recent Harvard-Harris poll, 80 percent of Americans support ending the practice of sanctuary cities that refuse to turn over criminal illegal aliens to Federal authorities.\n* Under the bill, States and localities that refuse to follow Federal law and that prevent law enforcement officials from cooperating with Federal authorities will no longer receive certain grants from the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS).\n* Instead, States and localities that adhere to Federal law will see grants shifted towards them.\n* The Secretary of Homeland Security can refuse to transfer illegal aliens in DHS custody to authorities that refuse to cooperate with Federal immigration authorities.\n* President Trump supports the passage of Kate's Law (H.R. 3004).\n* The law is named after 32-year-old Kate Steinle, who, according to law enforcement officials, was gunned down in broad daylight allegedly by a 5-time deported criminal illegal alien with seven prior felony convictions.\n* The law would increase the mandatory penalties for illegal aliens who re-enter the United States to up to two years in Federal prison.\n* Illegal aliens who re-enter the United States are eligible to up to 25 years of Federal prison.\n* In his efforts to help the victims of these crimes, the President ordered the creation of the Department of Homeland Security's Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) office so the victims of the criminal acts of illegal aliens will no longer be ignored.\nA PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: While running for President, Donald Trump promised the American people that he would bring law and order back to our broken immigration system.\n* As a Presidential candidate on August 31, 2016, President Trump said:\n* \"We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with Federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist Federal authorities.\"\n* \"Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws.\"\n* \"Now is the time for all of us, as one country, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all Americans.", "timestamp": "2017-06-28", "title": "Press Release - President Donald J.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126606", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: First of all, thank you all. Thanks for joining us today. Thanks for taking time out of your busy lives. I want to thank Mike Gordon and everyone at Tendon Manufacturing for hosting us today. Looking forward to visiting with folks and making more formal remarks in a bit.\nBut what the President and I have tried to do as we travel around the country is listen as much as we talk. And we are very close to achieving a signature goal of this administration, which is to repeal and replace Obamacare and give the American people not only relief from those disastrous policies, but give the American people and American businesses the kind of healthcare reform that will lower the cost of health insurance and while we give states all new flexibility to provide for the most vulnerable in our communities.\nSo I'd be anxious if you'd be willing to share, and we'll invite the media to stick around. Share your experiences with Obamacare. How important would it be for us to have the Congress pass legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare? How much of a burden has Obamacare placed on your businesses and your families? But I'd really welcome you to share for a couple minutes your own experience. We'll take 15 or 20 minutes here. And again, thank you so much for being here. But who wants to speak up.\nA PARTICIPANT: I start out (inaudible).\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And share with us your name and who you're with.\nA PARTICIPANT: My name is Jack Shrom (ph). I'm with Jurgens Incorporated (ph). We're a manufacturing company here in Cleveland, Ohio, ship all over the world.\nAnd the burdens that have come in all the administrative requirements that have been dropped on top of small manufacturers and medium-sized manufacturers.\nRight now it takes over 40 hours just to do the administrative paperwork to do the form filing and the 1095cs out there. Not only that, then we have to send it out to outside accountants that have to then formalize that, and we have outside attorney, accounting fees to (inaudible) documentation.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: How many employees do you have?\nA PARTICIPANT: We have about 450 employees worldwide, here in Cleveland and Chicago. And we export throughout the world, and we're a manufacturer. We're making stuff here. And if we can get rid of some of those burdens, I know it has a direct correlation to hiring.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: So the administrative requirements that put a tremendous financial burden --\nA PARTICIPANT: And it does nothing. It does absolutely nothing other than add to our cost of doing building, which adds nothing to putting product in the box, hiring a new person, doing anything that we can to increase jobs.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Other thoughts on how impossible it would be to repeal and replace Obamacare. Share your name and who you're with.\nA PARTICIPANT: (Inaudible) in 2014, we had 37 employees. I get to work with 36 great people every day. And I had to make the decision that we were no longer going to offer health insurance. So we had meetings. I brought in our insurance person and let them meet one and one.\nAnd then somebody in the administration, I don't know who that was, said, okay, because there was no small business market, we will allow you to continue to offer a noncompliant plan. And so every year we wait and hope that they will allow us to continue offer a noncompliant plan. And every year they have.\nThese 36 people get up and go to work every day. They deserve better than that. They deserve some certainty. They deserve to know there's a market in place. And I have no problem with helping the less fortunate. Neither does our people. But these people need some consideration, as well.\nAbout a third -- a small business study. About a third of small businesses are not hiring due to Obamacare. About half of small businesses have delayed pay raises due to Obamacare.\nNow we wonder what's happened to our middle class. They've been left behind because this legislation was about expanding coverage and not anything to do with retaining cost. And the reality is we need something to bring the cost of coverage down.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And have you seen your premiums rise? You've had --\nA PARTICIPANT: We saw even with a noncompliant plan --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: You've gotten those one-year waivers --\nA PARTICIPANT: Well, with the noncompliant plan in 2015, our average cost for employee went up 24.1 percent.\nA PARTICIPANT: Your health insurance did?\nA PARTICIPANT: Yes.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: 2015 it went up 24 percent?\nA PARTICIPANT: Yes. It then went up 7 percent and 7 percent the last two years -- primarily because our average tenure was 22 years, and we have employees that are now retiring.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Let me ask you -- you make a great point. I don't know. You said that you believe that third of businesses are putting off hiring -- a third of small businesses are putting off hiring.\nA PARTICIPANT: Yes, there was a study -- a small business study was done.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: By whom?\nA PARTICIPANT: The National Small Business Association.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay, and a half of those small businesses in that study have delayed pay raises because of the cost of health insurance in the wake of Obamacare. I literally hear this everywhere I go is the administrative burden, rising premiums, and frankly the quality of the coverage going down.\nI was with a group of families in Washington this week, came in from around the country, a few from Ohio, talked to me about the fact that they were paying $4,000 a year for a policy that had a $12,000 deductible, so it was essentially meaningless.\nSeveral people at the table faced with the same choice simply decided -- as 6.5 million Americans have -- to simply pay the fine because they concluded that whatever insurance they'd be paying for would effectively not give them coverage.\nYour thoughts.\nA PARTICIPANT: Well, Mr. Vice President, my husband and I we own a wonderful restaurant in Rocky River.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: How many employees in your restaurant?\nA PARTICIPANT: Well, originally we had 58. A lot of them were full-time because we had move from one building to another. Because of Obamacare, we felt so bad because a lot of these people were with us for like -- almost 25 years. They were with us (inaudible). And we just couldn't afford to keep them.\nSo our biggest thing we had to lay off a lot of wonderful people because they wanted full-time, and we couldn't afford it. So we had to go into the part-time.\nSo today the 58 have turned into 72 employees because of part-time.\nA PARTICIPANT: Is everybody part-time?\nA PARTICIPANT: A lot of them are, but I had to stay under 50 so I couldn't -- that was basically what we did -- 29 and 49. Everybody told us --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: So you went from 58 full-time employees.\nA PARTICIPANT: They were all -- a lot them were. I had almost 50 full-time.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Almost 50 full-time, but then to avoid Obamacare you said I have to take my payroll --\nA PARTICIPANT: I have to take my full-timers and go down. Otherwise we wouldn't stay in business, Mr. Vice President. It was just the end. Our profit margin is so low, we just couldn't.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. But do you want to provide health insurance to your employees at the restaurant?\nA PARTICIPANT: No, Mr. Vice President, we have tried in the past. And I offered it to the employees where they would pay 50 percent, we would pay 50 percent. They didn't want it. They said, please give us the money. They'd rather take the money.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, sure.\nPARTICIPANT: So I would love to. You know, they're wonderful -- employees aren't employees. They become like your family.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: You'd love to offer coverage.\nPARTICIPANT: I would love to offer coverage.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And then people can decide whether they want to have it.\nPARTICIPANT: If they want it or not.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, one of the provisions of the Republican legislation that's advancing is called association health plans which, in the case of the restaurant association -- see, a major corporation that does business nationwide can have a nationwide insurance pool for their employees. But a local entrepreneur owning a restaurant or a local manufacturer --\nPARTICIPANT: We can't.\nPARTICIPANT: We can't do it.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: But association health plans would permit you, because the President's great conviction about healthcare is that, if you give people the ability to buy health insurance across state lines or in associations or however they'd like to buy it -- and if you allow states to reform Medicaid so that it meets the unique needs of the people of Cleveland and the people of Ohio, the people of Indiana, in my state, that that goes a long way toward the kind of healthcare reform and results that the American people long for.\nBut it would give you and your company choices, and your employees choices that they just don't have today. But it's literally cost full-time jobs.\nClaudia.\nA PARTICIPANT: I'm Claudia Kovach (ph), City Machine Technologies (ph) in Youngstown. Healthcare is our biggest single expense. I spend $1,700 every day before I even turn on the lights on healthcare. For the last eight years, we're not getting any more for our money, prices are increasing, and the healthcare benefits are decreasing. I have higher copays. I have higher prescription drug costs. I have higher deductibles, higher premiums for our employees, and our employees are struggling to pay those.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: How many employees do you have, about?\nA PARTICIPANT: Sixty-five employees, and with insurance, CMT pays 80 percent of the premium, and our employees pay 20 percent. And our deductibles are great. We've always had a PPO, and then the last three years, we started with an HSA and a health savings account. And I really support the health savings accounts because I feel that you're a better healthcare consumer. But I have an HSA and we have a $2,600 deductible, and out of pocket is $3,500. We've had people with cancer and heavy medical issues, and if you're on the HSA, all you pay is $3,500 for your cancer treatment.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: When I was governor of the state of Indiana, we introduced health savings accounts into Medicaid. We already had health savings accounts for almost all of our 30,000 state employees. And all the great progress that you see in wellness and in the lowering the cost of healthcare around the country is --\nPARTICIPANT: It makes you think.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: -- consumer-directed healthcare. When you put people in charge of their own healthcare choices --\nPARTICIPANT: You make better choices and cheaper choices. You're more cost-effective.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: You make better choices and more cost-effective. Well said, I appreciate it very much.\nBut prices going up, benefits going down, that is the unbroken record of Obamacare -- premiums going up, benefits going down, which is the exact opposite of what we were promised.\nKaren, please.\nA PARTICIPANT: Well, I would like to ask if you are still going to have the Cadillac tax because that really doesn't make sense to me that the government should be penalizing somebody for offering the healthcare benefit that they want to. So we would have to pay the Cadillac tax.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Tell me about your company.\nA PARTICIPANT: So we have about 1,400 full-time employees.\nA PARTICIPANT: How many?\nA PARTICIPANT: Fourteen hundred. And it's a manufacturing company -- so our healthcare insurance is very expensive, and we also offer wellness care and so on. And we charge our employees very little because we consider it part of their employment package.\nBut because the costs have gone up so significantly over the last eight, 10 years, that's less in your pocket and more that just has to go toward this ever-escalating cost.\nAnd I was talking to my (inaudible) today, and he was telling me that one of the significant things about the way the system works is that all of the providers do this high-pressure thing to -- where they say, well, you can pay now. You can pay now. How much are you going to pay? Are you going to pay me now?\nAnd so in effect, they're getting your money, then they're going to give you a credit later on? Then that's not right. The entire system is so opaque because nobody knows what anything costs. They think it costs $20 to go to the doctor because that's their copay. But in reality, it costs $100. And I would like to see there be two things: one, insurance which is like car insurance, you have healthcare insurance. I like healthcare savings account. It's a great idea, and the association thing. That's the other one.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Association healthcare.\nA PARTICIPANT: Excellent idea. And then wellness, which is the healthcare benefits like dentist, vision, doctor checkups, all of those things -- there should be a separate item from insurance because insurance should be for catastrophic or out-of-the-ordinary. And healthcare benefits should be a (inaudible) but we're not separating those out.\nA PARTICIPANT: It used to be called hospitalization back in the day. (Inaudible) but now it's all one big mess.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: So how important to repeal Obamacare --\nA PARTICIPANT: Absolutely essential. It's absolutely essentially. It's such a (inaudible) to the system. No one knows what it costs. No one knows how to work. It's completely opaque, and it's extremely expensive. So I don't think you could find anybody that would say (inaudible) or that it made costs go down.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And they did call it the Affordable Care Act. (Laughter.)\nA PARTICIPANT: Right, I think (inaudible) the name.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I think that's what -- it would be funny if it didn't play such a hardship on the American people.\nA PARTICIPANT: Today we had a cookout, and all the management team makes hamburgers and hot dogs for all of our workforce. And I asked the one question that was the most concerning for them today. And it's their healthcare under what's going to happen. It's an anxiety that's (inaudible) through every single employees' eyes, I could see -- we had probably 150 at lunch today. And every person's eyes were scared for their children, their grandchildren, for everybody in regards because it's so uncertain. We need to get this thing fixed. Fix it right.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And don't you think, Jack and Karen (ph), I think the American people know that Obamacare has failed.\nA PARTICIPANT: Yes.\nA PARTICIPANT: They do. That's the uncertainty that you see in their eyes -- what's going to happen to my children and grandchildren.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, that it's collapsing, and that political class in Washington, D.C. and many in the national media continue to want to gloss over what -- virtually every day there's another insurance company that falls out of these exchanges.\nOhio has had its news in recent days, leaving many people in the state without effectively any choice in health insurance. That's why we're working so hard to get this done.\nA PARTICIPANT: Yes, you got to this done. But you know all the press (inaudible) -- and every hospital has to raise money, has to account for that. They have as a big part of their budget.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: It's called charity care.\nA PARTICIPANT: Yes, exactly. And so it's not true to say that all of these people will now die because they can't get healthcare. They will get healthcare.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: But we truly believe that you can make health insurance affordable by giving the American people more choices in health insurance, and by inviting greater competition. Your point about transparency is a great one.\nA PARTICIPANT: So you can shop.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Allowing people with health savings accounts and other innovative methods to be able to become consumers of healthcare, have information to make better choices in in their healthcare.\nAnd with regard to Medicaid, I will tell you before I had this job I was governor of your neighbor to the west. And in the state of Indiana, we also expanded Medicaid. But we did it with what was the most significant waiver in the history of Medicaid. We actually had people be able to have health savings accounts in Medicaid, and people took advantage of it. We're already seeing in Indiana people moving from using their emergency room to use primary care. We're getting. They're going to the doctor on an annual basis, engaging in wellness. It's actually very exciting when you empower people (inaudible) the ability to make their own healthcare choices.\nAnd when people lead healthier lives, they lead more productive lives. And it's a wonderful things, but this one-size-fits-all-Washington (inaudible) solution --\nA PARTICIPANT: Doesn't work (inaudible) --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: -- is literally collapsing in terms of the individual marketplace. And with regard to Medicaid, my heart broke this week. I had the mother of a special needs child who is kind of a miracle boy. He looked to be about 21 years old. She was from Illinois, and she said Illinois expanded Medicaid and the net result was that Illinois Medicaid reduced the coverage of her special needs child. Because once you expand your Medicaid program in the way that it's been expanded in many states, there's still scarce resources.\nAnd it was just heartbreaking because Medicaid was literally established to provide what we've American would want to see provided for the aged, the blind, the disabled, the vulnerable -- children, and yet now --\nA PARTICIPANT: (Inaudible) statistic -- whether it was in the papers, it said 49 percent of all live births are (inaudible) Medicaid.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: There are jurisdictions around the country, states around the country where that's actually true. And that's fine. That's fine.\nA PARTICIPANT: That's an incredible statistic.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, the American people -- I truly do -- the President and I truly do believe that it's enormously impossible to be there for people with a vulnerable need.\nBut we believe by giving states like Ohio the ability to reform Medicaid so it can better focus -- it can provide better services and then better focus on the most needy in the communities, it's possible.\nI talked to a woman from here in Ohio this week. I may mention here in my speech where literally I had tears in our eyes at forum just like this in which she said she paid the $4,000 a year for an Obamacare card. It's in her pocket. No doctor, no hospital, no clinic in her county here in Ohio takes the insurance that she was required to buy.\nA PARTICIPANT: Twenty counties just pulled out in Ohio.\nA PARTICIPANT: I went on the website. I'm 36. I'm healthy. The premiums for a catastrophic plan -- $10,000 deductible -- were more than my mortgage.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. I heard that from another person.\nA PARTICIPANT: I'm lucky to have employer-sponsored healthcare, but I'm just curious.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: You just went and you looked. I'm 36. I'm healthy. The premium on the policy -- if you didn't have it through your employer, you would be required to purchase.\nA PARTICIPANT: Yes, it was more than my mortgage payment.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: It was more than your mortgage. Obamacare.\nA PARTICIPANT: I'm Michael Canty (ph). I have a manufacturing company (inaudible) about 130 employees. After a lot of what you've just heard, higher administration costs, both outsourced -- because we don't have the expertise -- and insourced --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: How much is that costing you in the outsource without compromising your --\nA PARTICIPANT: We spend probably $12,000 to $20,000 a year just to outsource. That doesn't include the soft costs, the hourly costs for the various people in in-house who would have to track that, fill out the forms, the extra fees we pay on a per-head basis.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: So what would that be, your internal HR?\nA PARTICIPANT: We probably spend another $10,000 -- $12,000 for a small company.\nAnd the key to that along with some of the other costs we spend is that it takes capacity away from the manufacturer, away from the company. That's money they don't spend hiring people, buying equipment, building value which benefits everyone.\nOur overall costs for healthcare insurance, we provide that, plus dental, plus eyes, have almost doubled. Tom and I were comparing earlier his healthcare in 2015 went up 24 percent. Our quote for 2014 was 46 percent. We negotiated it down to 24 percent, then it went to 8 percent. And this year it was 16 percent. We negotiated it down with only the promise that we would renegotiate next year, and we pay 9.5 percent guaranteed next year for the same plan irrespective of what took place.\nAnd those costs are not just by the association -- or by the companies. Our employees, like many, cover 30 percent. And we just keep that percentage.\nSo they not only have that cost going up, but the deductibles. We used to have $500 and $1000 deductibles six years. We now have $6,000 -- or $3,000 and $6,000 deductible. So as you've already heard some people can't use it even if they had it, and they get a double hit with what's taking place.\nAnd the younger people won't do it. Only about a third of our company, which are mostly young, won't take insurance at all because they don't want to pay for it or they don't think they need some of the benefits that are mandated. They just want a catastrophic plan. And so they go without.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) It's really helpful. Thank you.\nPARTICIPANT: We really need to pass this through the Senate. It needs to get done. And I know you're working -- you and the President are working hard on that.\n(Inaudible.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes. It's in the bill.\nPARTICIPANT: (Inaudible.) The more local it is, the more state it is --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Look, every state has unique challenges. In Indiana and Ohio, you know, the scourge of opioid abuse is very real. You know, it affects communities large and small. There are states in this country where there are different challenges, different health challenges. And you're absolutely right. I -- of course, I bring the bias of having been a governor. But it is a centerpiece of this reform that states gain all-new flexibility. I mean, giving your governor here in Ohio the ability, in your legislature to redesign Medicaid in ways that will best meet the needs of people in Ohio. That's part of the President's vision for healthcare reform by creating a marketplace where we lower the cost of healthcare, which was part of one of the broken promises of Obamacare. They said it would lower premiums by several thousand dollars. And now premiums have gone up by more than $3,000 a year last I had checked.\nHow about -- why don't you give us one word, and then we'll run off to this next thing.\nA PARTICIPANT: So I'm Vince Costello (ph) with Diversified Mold and Casting (ph). We're a small manufacturer here in Warrensville Heights. We have 48 employees currently, and (inaudible.)\nWhen the ACA was passed, we did see costs go up significantly. Administrative costs, (inaudible) mention, we not only at the time spent, but the minimum 5 percent for costs just in administrative fees. We still (inaudible.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Did the premiums go up?\nA PARTICIPANT: Absolutely -- 23 percent annually.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Twenty-three percent annually since Obamacare was passed.\nA PARTICIPANT: (Inaudible) negotiated those down at times, as Michael mentioned. We've also gone through (inaudible) 60 percent out of our employees' out-of-pocket expenses. That's the only way I can get it affordable for them. They've (inaudible) premiums, and they obviously (inaudible) for a reason. (Inaudible.)\nIt's huge. People don't know what's coming. They didn't know it was coming with Obamacare. It happened. And those people still don't truly understand it.\nPARTICIPANT: Mr. Vice President, if I could just ask one question --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I'm sorry.\nPARTICIPANT: -- as it relates to the healthcare plan. Because one of the things that always concerns me, and I think it's something that all these manufacturers at the table think about -- you know, when we produce a product, we look at labor, we look at the material, we add our profit margin, and that's what we charge the customer. But healthcare delivery, they pick a number, and then, depending on which insurance you have, there's a discount off that number. The plain, simple fact is, I believe, that, unless we start driving down the cost of the healthcare, it doesn't matter whether -- what insurance is going to pay. I always make the analogy that if you bump out your headlight, and it costs $5,000 to fix it, guess what your car insurance is going to cost?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Right.\nPARTICIPANT: So that's the biggest question I have as it relates to the driving down of the healthcare costs. I mean, we just had the baby -- told me the bills were between 25 and 30,000 dollars. I mean, not that my daughter is not worth it. (Laughter.) I just want to make that clear. But, you know, it seems kind of excessive. When Katie was born it was (inaudible) you know? So, he alone would take up two months of our premiums.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. I was in the Congress at the time Obamacare passed and fought against it. By the way, I didn't introduce him but Congressman Jim Renacci is here who is a terrific representative of Ohio in Washington, D.C. -- he's going to be joining me.\nAll the debate was about how do we lower cost.\nA PARTICPANT: The cost of the healthcare.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: With the Democrat majorities, it changed to how do we add universal coverage. And so, frankly, when you see the individual mandate and you see fines against Americans who -- there are 6.5 million Americans who pay a fine instead of paying for insurance. That should tell you something about what the marketplace and insurance offers people in the individual marketplace. There's people saying I'd rather pay a fine than get healthcare -- than pay for the insurance (inaudible) research for yourself.\nPresident Trump is committed to shifting the debate back to lowering the cost of health insurance, giving states greater freedom and flexibility to reform Medicaid to meet the needs of the most vulnerable. But I'll tell all of you, thank you for sharing your stories. I want to thank members of the media for being here. And this is what I hear all over the country -- what the American people are experiencing with Obamacare and it's why's we're working so hard to get the job done. And I just promise you help is on the way. Okay?\nPARTICIPANTS: Thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: We're going to get this thing done.\nA PARTICPANT: Our sales aren't increasing at the rate healthcare is increasing. And we need help.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, we're coming.\nA PARTICIPANT: (Inaudible.) We belong to the same association -- all four of us manufacturers would be a national number of an association plan --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And why shouldn't your local manufacturers like Tendon, like yourself be able to buy insurance the way a major corporation, a major national corporation can buy health insurance for its employees? These are the changes that can come -- free market competition will work, lower costs, improve benefits, as it always has throughout our history. And with your help and with our Senate' help, we're going to get it done. Thank you.

Peter Ricketts of Nebraska; and Gov. William M. Walker of Alaska.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126564", "text": "The President. Thank you all for being here. Mr. Secretary, formerly Mr. Governor.\nSecretary of Energy J. Richard Perry. Energy waste, sir.\nThe President. How's it going? Everything good?\nSecretary Perry. Yes, sir.\nThe President. That's great. Thank you all for being here. Very much appreciated. We welcome you to the White House. Have you all been to the White House before? Have you been here before?\nSouthern Ute Tribe Council Member Kevin Frost. Yes.\nThe President. That's good. Well, you guys have been—most people say no. I'm very impressed with that, Kim.\nI'm thrilled to be joined by Governor Paul LePage, Kim Reynolds, Pete Ricketts, and Bill Walker, along with State and Tribal leaders from around our great country. I'd also like to thank Secretary Perry and EPA Administrator Pruitt—both here also—for their work to help the United States achieve true energy dominance. And that's what's happening. We've made so much progress with respect to energy just in the last 4 months. It's been an incredible journey, I will tell you. We've learned a lot and we've made a lot—we're here to talk about how we can create new prosperity for our citizens by unlocking vast treasures of energy reserves, which we have a great deal—far more than anyone understood.\nI'm proud to have such a large gathering of Tribal leaders here at the White House. I look forward to more government-to-government consultations with Tribal leaders about the issues important to Indian Country. We love Indian Country, right?\nMany of your lands have rich, natural resources that stand to benefit your people immensely. These untapped resources of wealth can help you build new schools, fix roads, improve your communities, and create jobs, jobs like you've never seen before. All you want is the freedom to use them, and that's been the problem. It's been very difficult, hasn't it? It will be a lot easier now under the Trump administration.\nFor too long, the Federal Government has put up restrictions and regulations that put this energy wealth out of reach. It's just totally out of reach. It's been really restricted, the development itself has been restricted, and vast amounts of deposits of coal and other resources have, in a way, been taken out of your hands. And we're going to have that changed. We're going to put it back in your hands.\nThese infringements on Tribal sovereignty are deeply unfair to Native Americans and Native American communities who are being denied access to the energy and wealth that they have on their own lands. Many of our States have also been denied access to the abundant energy resources on their lands that could bring greater wealth to the people and benefit to our whole Nation. We're becoming more and more energy dominant. I don't want to be energy free; we want to be energy dominant in terms of the world. From my first day in office, we've taken swift action to lift the crushing restrictions on American energy. Scott Pruitt has done an amazing job, an incredible job, in a very short period of time, and most people love him. There are a couple that don't, but that's okay, right? [Laughter] We're also putting our people back to work by doing this.\nToday's conversation is a chance for these State, local, and Tribal leaders to discuss how we can cooperate and support them even more in unleashing these domestic energy reserves. They're tremendous reserves that we never appreciated, we never understood, but now we understand them very well.\nI'm confident that working together, we can usher in a golden age of American energy dominance and the extraordinary financial and security benefits that it brings to our citizens, not only the Native Americans, but all over the country. And we're seeing it more and more, and it's happening more and more.\nI just also want to tell you that, yesterday we had a tremendous meeting with the Republican Senators, met on health care. And the meeting went really well. We're talking about a great, great form of health care. Obamacare is dying. It's essentially dead. If you don't give it the subsidy, it would die within 24 hours. It's been a headache for everybody. It's been a nightmare for many.\nAnd we are looking at a health care that would be a fantastic tribute to our country, a health care that will take care of people, finally, for the right reasons and also at the right cost. It would be a tremendous reduction in costs from what Obamacare is. Yesterday, in Alaska, a great State, they had a 216—it was announced a 216-percent increase.\nSo we have a plan that, if we get it approved—it's very tough. Every State is different; every Senator is different. But I have to tell you, the Republican Senators had a really impressive meeting yesterday at the White House. We had close to 50 of them. We have 52; we need almost all of them. That's never easy. But we had, essentially, 50 show up to the meeting, and the other two are on our side. I think we're going to get at least very close, and I think we're going to get it over the line. There was a great, great feeling in that room yesterday.\nAnd what also came out is the fact that this health care would be so good, would be far better than Obamacare, and would be much less expensive for the people and actually much less expensive, also, for the country. So those are a lot of good factors.\nSo we'll see what happens. We're working very hard. We've given ourselves a little bit more time to make it perfect. That's what we want to do. I think this has a chance to be a great health care at a reasonable cost. People can save a lot of money. We get rid of the mandates, we get rid of so much—got rid of a lot of the taxes. All of the bad parts of Obamacare are gone. Essentially, it's a repeal and replace. And I look forward to working with the Republican Senators over a short period of time. I know Rick is very excited about the health care that we're talking about.\nSecretary Perry. Actually, having these Governors sitting around the table is a great example of it. And one of the things that—I know Kim and Paul, they'd like to be able to put health care into place that they helped——\nGovernor Kimberly K. Reynolds of Iowa. Write.\nSecretary Perry. ——write and their citizens help write because I know these—I don't know Bill that well, but my bet is, he's the same. You give him the authority to take care of their citizens, they can have more people covered and do it at less cost.\nGov. Reynolds. Yes.\nSecretary Perry. I am quite confident—— The President. Well, we're sending a lot of it back to the States where it belongs. And this will be something really special if we can get it done. Always tough.\nGov. Reynolds. Always tough.\nThe President. It's probably the toughest subject from the standpoint of approval because every State is different. Every State has different needs. We have a tremendous opioid problem, and some States are more affected by that than others. But overall, I have to tell you, this will be a tremendous plan. It will really—you're going to have a lot of very, very happy people in this country if we can get it done.\nSo we're working very hard on health care, and I think we're going to have a great answer. And hopefully, we're going to have it soon. And we will keep you informed. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\nHealth Care Reform Legislation\nQ. Mr. President, are you concerned about the Medicaid cuts in the health care bill?\nThe President. It's going to great. This will be great for everybody.\nQ. Mr. President, why do you say \"if\"? Do you still have hope that this will get across the finish line?\nThe President. I always say \"if.\" I always say \"if.\"\nQ. Mr. President, yesterday Governor Perry said that he doesn't know if you still believe in climate change or you think it is a hoax. Are you ever going to answer that?\nThe President.

Good to have you all. Hello, Chairman. Great man, right here. Might be another one right there. We have some good ones. We had a wonderful meeting on health care yesterday you probably know about, and so we're moving along. Hello, Thomas.\nThank you very much for being here to discuss two crucial votes taking place in Congress tomorrow on vital safety and national security legislation.\nWe're joined by the chairman of the House Judiciary, Bob Goodlatte, a friend of mine for a long time. Bob is one of the most skilled legislators in Congress—and you didn't even tell me to say that, Bob, right—[laughter]—and he's worked with law enforcement to write a series of critical immigration bills that will close the dangerous loopholes exploited by criminals, gang members, drug dealers, killers, terrorists.\nMS-13 is a prime target. They are bad people. And we've gotten many of them out already. You know, we're pretty much at the 50-percent mark. We're getting them out as fast as we can get them out, and we're freeing up towns. We're actually liberating towns, if you can believe that we have to do that in the United States of America. But we're doing it, and we're doing it fast.\nAlso with us today are Congressman Peter King, another friend. Lou Barletta, where's Lou? Lou, another friend. So you're running for Governor, Lou? Huh? Look behind you, Lou. You can make a big announcement today. [Laughter] Lou Barletta, an early supporter. Thank you, Lou. And David Young.\nTomorrow the House will vote on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. It's been in the works for a long time. People have wanted it, Bob, for a long time. But we were able to get this process going, and I hope you're going to be successful. You'll be successful tomorrow with the vote?\nRepresentative Robert W. Goodlatte. We will.\nThe President. Good—which will cut Federal grant money to cities that shield dangerous criminal aliens from being turned over to Federal law enforcement.\nThe House will also vote on Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant and who's been deported five times. This law will enhance criminal penalties for those who repeatedly reenter the country illegally.\nCountless innocent Americans, including the loved ones of many families in the room—and many of these families are friends of mine—great friends of mine that I got to know over the campaign trail because they fought so hard for this. And they are with us. They've had members of their family killed by illegal immigrants and, really, people with multiple—in some cases, multiple deportations.\nI'm especially honored to be here with so many courageous families whom I did get to know so well over the past period of time. And here's one right over here: Jamiel, a great, great man with a great son. Great son, great family.\nYou lost the people that you love because our Government refused to enforce our Nation's immigration laws. And that's even the existing immigration laws, without new laws. That's existing immigration laws. For years, the pundits, journalists, politicians in Washington refused to hear your voices, but on election day, 2016, your voices were heard all across the entire world. Right? You'd better believe it. Nobody died in vain, I can tell you.\nChairman Goodlatte has produced a package of truly key immigration enforcement bills. We've been waiting for these for a long time, and I want to thank you, Chairman, for doing that. Great job. And it's just perfect.\nThis package includes the Davis-Oliver Act, whose passage I called for nearly a year ago at my Inauguration speech and immigration speech—both—the immigration speech taking place in Phoenix, Arizona. The Davis-Oliver Act was named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, who were gunned down in the line of duty by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. And everybody knew this person was big, big trouble, and they begged law enforcement to get him out. And they were unable to do that.\nTheir incredibly brave widows honored—and they're here with us, by the way—and we're honoring them today. And it's honored—where are you please? The widow—where is—they're here someplace. In the back of the room? Thank you. Thank you.\nWe're privileged to be joined by Melissa. Melissa——\nFair Oaks, CA, resident Melissa Oliver-Storz. Right here.\nThe President. That's what I thought. Hello, Melissa. [Laughter] Melissa Oliver. And I just want to say that your father was a true hero—and you know that—and a great gentleman, and we miss him. You miss him. We miss him.\nWe're calling on all Members of Congress to honor grieving American families by passing these lifesaving measures in the House, in the Senate, and then sending them to my desk for a very rapid signature. I promise you, it will be done quickly. You don't have to wait the mandatory period. It will be very quick, Melissa, in honor of your father and others, okay? And in honor of Jamiel.\nLos Angeles, CA, resident Jamiel Shaw, Sr. Thank you.\nThe President. It's time to support our police, to protect our families, and to save American lives. And also to start getting smart.\nSo with that, I'd like to ask each of the families invited and some of the folks that I know that—and some I've gotten to know so well. I'd like to start with Jamiel, to tell just a quick story about how great your son was, perhaps what happened, so that other people can learn by it. And your son was an incredible young man, incredible student and athlete. Tell us about your son Jamiel.\n[At this point, the participants introduced themselves and made brief remarks, but no transcript was provided.", "timestamp": "2017-06-28", "title": "Remarks During a Meeting With Victims of Crimes Committed by Immigrants"}

I would like to invite Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin up to speak first with all of you and take a few questions regarding a recent announcement on sanctions. And, as always, I will be back after to answer your questions.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you. Today, the Trump administration is continuing its efforts against the government of North Korea. Despite multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions imposing international sanctions, the government of North Korea continues its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nToday, Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has found the Bank of Dandong to be a foreign financial institution of primary money laundering concern under Section 311 of the U.S.A Patriot Act. This bank has served as a gateway for North Korea to access the U.S. and international financial systems, facilitating millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nThe United States will not stand for such action. This will require U.S. banks to ensure that the Bank of Dandong does not access the U.S. financial system directly or indirectly through other foreign banks. This action reaffirms the Treasury Department's commitment to ensure that North Korea is cut off from the U.S. financial system.\nIn addition, the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control has sanctioned two individuals and one entity for their continued support of North Korea's activities.\nWhile today's actions are directed at Chinese individuals and entities, we look forward to continuing working closely with the government of China to stop illicit financing involving North Korea. We are in no way targeting China with these actions. We will be meeting with China and other countries at the G20 next week to further our efforts to cut off North Korea's illicit activities.\nNorth Korea's provocative, destabilizing, and inhumane behavior will not be tolerated. We are committed to targeting North Korea's external enablers in maximizing economic pressure on the regime until it ceases its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nAnd with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions.\nQ: Thank you very much. On North Korea, recently, a congressman introduced about North Korea travel bans, but do you -- I mean, do Treasury Department have any guideline for the North Korea travel ban act?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I have no comments on that today, although I will say we will continue to look at a range of options as we are very serious about them stopping their activity.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, can you quantify the financial activity that you're trying to stop today and the access, direct and indirect, this particular bank had to U.S. financial markets?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: This is very significant, since this is the first bank that we've cut off under this, and that we will continue to look at these actions and continue to roll out sanctions. As I said, in this case it's millions of dollars, but we are committed to cutting off all illegal funds going to North Korea.\nQ: Can you explain how it works? Can you explain how it works, Mr. Secretary?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes. So when we put sanctions --\nQ: What they're doing now and what you're trying to stop.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: This bank will not be able to access the U.S. financial system, either directly or indirectly. So it's a very significant action.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, you've made clear that this was not a punishment against China, but obviously the White House wants to be putting pressure on Beijing to take action on North Korea. Are you satisfied that China will see it that way and with what China is doing currently against North Korea?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, I think, as you know, President Trump and President Xi have had very productive conversations about North Korea, and we appreciate their work and hope they will continue to work with us. Notwithstanding that, we are taking these actions to show the seriousness in which we are going to deal with this.\nIn the back.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Can you talk more about the link between this specific bank and the government of North Korea? We're trying to get a better picture of what exactly they were funding in North Korea.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I'm not going to go into the specifics of that because it does involve certain intelligence. But again, I can tell you we have very specific intelligence. And again, we will follow the money and cut off the money.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, would you be able to explain to us -- I know you did the research -- the actual economic impact this is going to have on the North Koreans and how that economic impact negatively may cause them a change in their position?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, I think, as you know, in Iran, these sanctions were very effective, and that's what brought Iran to the table. And we will continue to work with our allies and we will continue to speak to people at the G20. We are firmly committed to work with other nations to cut off illicit financing.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, was China given a heads-up in any way about the action that you're announcing today? And you used a term in your statement. Is China an enabler as it relates to North Korea?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, I'm not going to comment specifically on our behind-the-scenes conversations. We've obviously had very productive conversations with them.\nAgain, as I said, this is not directed at China, this is directed at a bank as well as individuals and entities in China. And again, whether they're in China or anyone else, we will continue with sanctions.\nQ: Can North Korea simply move their assets from this particular bank to another bank in China? Are they permissible to do that?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, if we find other activity, we will sanction other entities. Nobody is off limits.\nQ: Quick follow-up on China. Can you just characterize whether you think China is doing enough? Because last week, the President tweeted, \"While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi of China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried.\" It sounds like he was giving up on China. Has he?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I don't think the President is giving up in any sense. I think we will continue to work with China and everyone else. The President is firmly committed that we will cut the money off to North Korea until they behave properly.\nQ: Any asks of the South Korean leader today?\nQ: Let me ask you a few here, if you don't mind. Two different topics. One, how much do you feel that China has actually moved the needle on North Korea? Two, in terms of tax reform, you say you've got 100 folks over there, roughly, at the Treasury Department dealing with that issue. Are there any contingency plans in place in case healthcare doesn't get done? And thirdly, Janet Yellen, how much is the administration -- is the administration seriously considering her to remain on as Fed chair?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, that's an awful lot of questions, so let me work backwards. Again, no decisions have been made in regard to the Fed chair. Gary Cohn and I will at some point make recommendations to the President, but no decisions have been made on that.\nIn regards to tax reform, I think, as you've heard Gary and I say, we are very committed to get tax reform done this year. It is one of the President's top priorities for economic growth. I think the people of America understand that, that we need economic growth and we're committed to doing that. I expect that healthcare hopefully will get done, but regardless, we are committed to getting tax reform done.\nAnd you had so many questions I forgot your first one.\nQ: And then how much -- well, let me actually follow up with you on tax reform, if you don't mind. Paul Ryan had said today that things are on track. Why should the American public believe that things are actually on track with what we see what's going on with healthcare reform and it seems like the timeline keeps getting pushed?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Why shouldn't the American public believe it? Of course they should believe it. We've said that, Speaker Ryan has said that, Chairman Hatch has said it. We are all 100 percent committed to getting tax reform done this year.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, in February you received a letter from lawmakers suggesting the Treasury Department should consider sanctioning the Bank of China. My question to you is, have you reconsidered that idea? Do you think that idea is on the table? And then the second question I had is about the debt ceiling. My understanding is that the debt ceiling, drop-dead time for you all is October. Does that give Congress additional time in your mind, or would you still like them to act earlier?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I haven't given any specifics in regards to the drop-dead date. What I have said is that I hope that Congress acts before they leave, yet we do have contingency plans if they don't so that the market shouldn't be concerned. But again, I think for the benefit of everybody, the sooner that they do this, the better. And as it relates to banks, again, I think as you've seen, we've taken very significant action today. We will continue to take very significant action rolling out additional sanctions on North Korea until they stop their behavior.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, one question on indirect access to the banking system. Are you aware of other banks that are providing similar access to the North Koreans -- to the international financial system? And what other banks are you prepared to take steps against going forward?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, let me just say we have a team of people both in Treasury and working with the intelligence agencies. And as we see other banks or individuals or entities, you can expect we will continue to rollout additional sanctions. This is something we take very seriously. We will be having discussions with our counterparties at the G20. This is a big priority of ours.\nQ: This is not about targeting China but this is aimed at a Chinese bank. Does it speak to a message that you're trying to send to China in any way, specifically right before the G20? Or is this really an indication of how limited your options are in terms of just dealing with North Korea directly?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, first of all, I wouldn't say in any way it's limited in what our options are. Quite the contrary -- we are committed and we will work with everybody, and nothing is off the table. Where we see illicit financing, we will stop it.\nAnd there's no message before the G20. The message to everybody at the G20 is this is a serious issue, we're going to work with everybody. But if there is illicit financing going on, we will cut it off from the U.S. financial system, which has significant impacts.\nQ: Just to follow up, you're saying in no way this is a message aimed at China?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I specifically said in my comments this wasn't aimed at China. We continue to work with them. Again, this is about North Korea, and this is about how serious we're taking this. And, kind of, whether it's China or anybody else, we will take this seriously.\nQ: Will this help with the release of the three Americans still detained?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I'm not going to make any comments about that.\nQ: At the end of Kristen's question here, you say, \"The President is firmly committed that we will cut the money off to North Korea until they behave properly.\" How are you defining success with that? In other words, what are you exactly looking for --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I think you'll know success when you see it.\nQ: Well, no, I'm asking how do you and the administration feel.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, I think everybody will know success. Their behavior is unacceptable and it will be very clear, kind of, we want them to stop doing tests of the ballistic missile programs and others. It's very clear.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, I want to ask you something that a lot of people don't understand and you're uniquely qualified to explain. The administration and Congress are saying there will be $321 billion in savings from the healthcare bills that are out there. But isn't that because people and benefits are being taken away? So isn't this really just a takeaway?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Not at all, okay? And one of the flaws of the scoring on the CBO -- on this, when you look at the number of people -- is that, again, there's a lot of people, when given the option, will decide not to elect to take this healthcare because it's a bad deal. That doesn't mean people are losing healthcare. I think everybody knows Obamacare was just a giant tax hike on the economy. It slowed down the economy. It's another reason why we've continued to have sub-two percent growth for the last eight years. And this administration is 100 percent focused on creating economic growth, creating jobs, creating proper wages, and getting this economy back to 3 percent or higher.\nYes, right here in the front.\nQ: First of all, congratulations.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you very much.\nQ: I've got a couple dorky finance questions. Could you talk about -- just if push came to shove, would you advise for prioritizing debt payments or not? And do you believe that CFIUS review of Chinese investments into the U.S. should be more careful or more involved?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, again, let me just make the comment on CFIUS. I do chair CFIUS. I take it very seriously, and I can tell you the reviews are very careful and very involved no matter who's on the other side. It's very important for national security, and we will use that to the maximum powers.\nAnd in regards to prioritization, again, I think that Congress should act quickly, raise the debt ceiling, and we should pay our debts on time.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. And I was going to say congratulations too. (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you.\nQ: Two questions. First, you were a participant, along with Madam Lagarde, at the last IMF-World Bank meeting and you certainly know there was some concern about what the future of U.S. policy is toward involvement with the International Monetary Fund. What is the U.S. policy toward that and toward involvement in financial relief in the Eurozone?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: So let me just say I've had the pleasure of meeting with Christine at least a dozen times. I think the IMF plays a very important role in looking at currency and world economies. The IMF was very helpful in regards to stabilizing the Greece situation and working with Europe. I think that could have been a major problem this summer that would have had significant concerns to the markets and the economy, and I think she was a very important part of those negotiations.\nQ: My second question was, how do you feel about maintaining the U.S. level of support at the IMF at the current level and, specifically, as a part of the relief for Greece? Because the U.S. role is through the IMF in relief of the Greek financial crisis.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yeah, well let me just comment. The IMF commitment to Greece was quite small. I'm not even sure that Greece is necessarily going to use that, so I think the significance was really more of a stamp of approval. And, again, there's no direct cost to the U.S. or the taxpayers. And we're supportive of the IMF, although we'll look at our contributions to the IMF like we look at all contributions very carefully and making sure we're spending the taxpayers' money properly.\nIn the back, yes.\nQ: Can you clarify which entities are being sanctioned? Because the paperwork that OFAC sent out also includes Dalian Global Unity Shipping -- two Chinese individuals -- and does not mention the Bank of Dandong in that paperwork. So is it four total entities and then these two individuals?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: So there's two different actions. There was a FINCEN action against the Bank of Dandong, and then there are the three OFAC sanctions, as you've pointed out.\nQ: So we should see a release from which part of Treasury? You said FINCEN?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: You will see. FINCEN. There will also be released on the bank.\nQ: And did you communicate this in advance to Beijing that this was going to happen?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, I'm not making any comments on our behind-the-scenes -- how we can communicate.\nQ: In regards to tax reform, you're a mathematical man. What are the chances that we get a 15 percent corporate tax rate or a 25 percent corporate tax rate in the final bill?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Let me just comment. Tax reform is a pass/fail exercise, okay? And we're going to get this passed for a plan that's good for the American public. So we are working closely with the House and the Senate, and we're going to get a bill that's passed that's going to be great for this economy, great for Americans, putting people back to work.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, how is it possible for reducing the funding source for the healthcare to lead to lower premiums and expanded coverage?\nMR. MNUCHIN: Again, I'm here primarily to talk about sanctions and tax reform, but I will comment again on healthcare, although it's not my primary area. The healthcare that's been in place is a bad deal for the American public, and that's why a lot of people aren't using it. It was a giant tax hike to the American economy, and premiums have been going up a ton. So we're looking at making the system more competitive so people can actually afford it.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, we heard for your counterpart at the Department of Homeland Security that airports all over the world have to step up aviation security because there's this threat. This is the product of a month's-long discussion within the interagency process that resulted in yesterday's decision. I'm wondering if you are convinced that the potential security risk -- are you satisfied that the security risk outweighs any potential economic risk if, for example, certain airlines are cut off or certain airports are cut off if they don't comply?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me just say, I can think of nobody better than General Kelly to protect our country in this position. Again, I've had the opportunity to discuss these issues with him at the National Security Council. I'm not going to comment specifically, but let me make it clear: The safety of the American public is our utmost concern, and we will never, ever put economic issues, where we would risk the lives of the American public.\nQ: On tax reform, are you going to be revenue neutral? And if the CBO and JCT say you don't get the growth or the revenue, what are you going to do?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, let me just first say there will be complete transparency when we come out with the plan. We are in the process of listening sessions. We've literally met with hundreds and hundreds of CEOs, think-tanks, various different groups. I was over at the House twice today, talking to people at the House of Representatives in groups. We've been at the Senate. We're listening. And as we develop this plan, we've said we're going to have a responsible plan that is paid for, and we do believe in dynamic scoring and we're going to take that into account.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, the GDP for the first quarter came out today at 1.4 percent -- slightly better than economists anticipated. But during the campaign, the President repeatedly promised to have growth rates between 3 and 4 percent. Two questions. First, how much of that 1.4 percent is attributable to the actions of this administration, or inactions? And secondly, when are we going to start seeing the 3 to 4 percent growth rate that the President promised?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: So again, I think I've been very clear on what our projections are for growth and that we believe that we can get to 3 percent or higher GDP. We've been very clear that that's not this year, that's not next year. It will take some time to scale in. Our projection over the 10-year period is actually 2.9 percent, which I think is quite conservative, scaling up to 3 and staying there, which I think both the President and I believe we can do better than 3 percent. So our projections in the budget are quite conservative.\nI think that to the extent we can get healthcare passed, to the extent we can get tax reform passed, to the extent we can roll back regulatory issues, which we're working on very carefully, both in financial and in energy and in other areas, we are very comfortable that we will hit these growth projections.\nI'm going to take two more questions, and then I'm going to have to turn it over to the superstar over here.\nQ: Thank you. The President said before that if China is not going to help solve the North Korea problem, then the U.S. will. He's made it clear that he doesn't think that China is currently doing enough. So where does he stand on the U.S. taking unilateral action? And is there a deadline, such as the G20 meeting ultimatum, or a deadline for which the U.S. need to -- sorry, that China would need to do more?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I think the President has made it very clear that if there are deadlines, he is not going to advertise those deadlines. So I am not going to make any specific comments as to whether he has a deadline, or, if he has a deadline, when it is. That would make absolutely no sense. I can assure you we will have conversations with our G20 counterparts about this next week, and we've been having these conversations and we will continue to do more on this.\nOne more question. Right here.\nQ: There was a little bit of a legislative snafu, but it does appear that the House and Senate will pass sanctions legislation related to Russia. It includes a broad range of sanctions. I don't think we've gotten a straight answer from the White House on whether the President would support that. Does the administration support that? Is Treasury prepared to implement those sanctions?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me just be clear -- again, not only the sanctions that we have on North Korea today. We have sanctions on Iran already. We will continue to put more sanctions on Iran around their ballistic missile and other programs. You've seen we've used sanctions in other areas. We will continue to use these.\nSo, notwithstanding anything Congress passes, I can assure you this administration and the Treasury Department will use sanctions to the maximum amount available by law. We don't need Congress to tell us to put on more. We're going to do more whether they tell us or not. But anyway, we look --\nQ: Are those called for --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: -- the Russia sanctions, we got plenty of those on, as well.\nSo again, thank you, everybody. A pleasure to be here.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. At the top of yesterday's briefing, you heard from Tom Homan and John Huber about how important the two immigration bills the House will be voting on today are in our efforts to secure the border and protect our communities.\nThis morning, Secretary Kelly spoke about Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act on the Hill -- important legislation that is supported by 80 percent of Americans.\nYesterday, the President heard the tragic stories of the innocent American lives that were ended by a violent individual who should never have been allowed into our country or our communities. [Jamiel Shaw], a star high school athlete from Los Angeles, who was killed by a member of the 18th Street gang, while his mother was serving her second tour of duty in Iraq. And Joshua Wilkerson, who was brutally beaten and tortured to death by his classmate in Texas who then set his body on fire. Christy Pina, a 14-year-old girl who was raped and murdered by a man who had multiple warrants out for other crimes involving kidnapping and rape. Twenty-five years later, he was finally located in his native Mexico, where he fled after murdering Christy in 1990.\nThe President also heard from federal immigration officials and local sheriffs who are on the front lines of this fight to protect innocent American lives. These laws will help to empower the federal government -- in partnership with local authorities -- to more easily locate and remove these violent individuals and prevent so-called sanctuary cities from receiving benefits from the very agency whose rules they are refusing to enforce.\nThe President looks forward to seeing these commonsense proposals pass the House today so we can be one step closer to helping fulfill his campaign promise to help stop these horrific crimes.\nYesterday, we were disappointed to see that people living in 14 out of Nevada's 18 counties will be left without a single choice on the state's Obamacare exchanges, specifically citing difficulties due to a \"shrinking and deteriorating market.\" And to add insult to injury, the thousands of people living in Nevada without access to health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges will then be taxed for not having insurance that isn't even available to them.\nThis is yet another reminder that Obamacare is continuing to collapse, leaving millions of people around the country suffering, and the consequences of this failed law.\nThe Vice President is back on the Hill this afternoon for one-on-one meetings on healthcare. As work continues this week towards repealing and replacing Obamacare, we are keeping these American families, business owners, and individuals at the front of our minds. They've been paying ever-increasing premiums and still losing their plans and their doctors, and it's time for Republicans in the Senate to fulfill their promise to the American people and come together around a consensus plan to fix this broken system.\nIn terms of the schedule for today, this afternoon the President will make a big speech on the importance of American energy dominance at the Department of Energy. The United States has been reliant on other countries for our energy for decades, but with new innovations and advances, particularly in liquid natural gas, we have had the opportunity to not only become energy independent, but to use our abundant resources as an important tool in advancing our global interests.\nI'm going to let the President get into more details on how we're going to do that later this afternoon. Hopefully you'll all tune in.\nThere have been a few questions asked this week, and Sean and I both said that we would get back to you on. I want to address a couple of those now.\nOn Monday, Sean was asked about how we knew that the Supreme Court's ruling on the President's travel executive order was 9-0 when the case was -- when the decision was announced. In fact, the decision, which stayed the lower court's injunction on the President's executive order for all affected individuals without a bona fide connection to a person or entity in the United States, was unanimous on the point that the stay should be granted at least to that extent. Three justices would have gone further and stayed the injunctions in full. No justice dissented on the point that the stay should be granted in part, and no justice indicated that he or she did not participate in the decision.\nJennifer Jacobs from Bloomberg also asked about the IMF's projection about U.S. growth. This morning, the Commerce Department revised First Quarter GDP upward. But both the IMF and the Commerce Department's figures show we still have more work to do. The President has spoken out clearly about the need for faster and more sustainable economic growth that will create jobs and raise incomes for Americans. The IMF has expressed support for a lot of the President's policies, including more infrastructure spending, reforming our tax code, boosting educational outcomes, and adopting family-friendly policies. President is also working to end job-killing government regulations and negotiate good trade policies that help workers.\nLastly, Jordan Fabian from the Hill asked what deal-breakers exist in Senate negotiations on the healthcare bill. The President isn't going to negotiate in public, but he has laid out his priorities to repeal and replace Obamacare with a system that provides greater choices and better coverage at lower cost. I can tell you that Obamacare is failing and new policy is around the corner.\nFrom our ongoing negotiations, we're confident that any amendments the Senate agrees to will make the bill stronger. The other bill out there that's gained the support of a majority of House Democrats is the Bernie Sanders single-payer plan that would cost the government $32 trillion over the next decades. 113 House Democrats, including the DNC vice chair, have signed on to this approach.\nThe President believes that it's completely unaffordable and creates a one-size-fits-all government approach to healthcare. That bill and others like it on the other side that have been proposed are clearly deal-breakers.\nNow that I've answered a couple of the questions from earlier this week, be happy to take a few now.\nJohn Roberts.\nQ: Sarah, in reference to the President's tweets this morning that have been a matter of some discussion today, you said earlier on Fox News that the President has a right to defend himself when he is attacked and it's no secret that this particular program has been very critical of him. However, the nature of the tweets this morning has drawn condemnation from people on Capitol Hill, including the Speaker of the House, Senator Graham, Senator Susan Collins -- all of whom are allies of the President. Did the President go too far with his tweet in its deeply personal nature?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think so. I mean, I think that the President has been attacked mercilessly on personal accounts by members on that program, and I think he's been very clear that when he gets attacked he's going to hit back.\nI think the American people elected somebody who's tough, who's smart, and who's a fighter. And that's Donald Trump. And I don't think that it's a surprise to anybody that he fights fire with fire. The things that this show has called him -- and not just him but numerous members of his staff, including myself and many others -- are very deeply personal.\nSo to then turn and pretend like this approach is -- I guess it's kind of like we're living in the twilight zone. They do this day after day after day, and then the President responds and defends himself and everybody is appalled and blown away.\nFrankly, if this had happened in the previous administration, the type of attacks launched on this program, the things they say, utterly stupid, personality disorder, mentally ill, constant personal attacks calling multiple members liars, liars to their faces while they're sitting on their programs -- the rest of the media would have said, guys, no way, hold on. But nobody does that.\nBut the President, he's not going to step back. He's showed that, and that's exactly what he did today.\nQ: If I could just follow on that, Sarah, if I could just follow on that. A couple of the criticisms from supporters of the President have been that this particular tweet was beneath the dignity of the office. Where does the President draw that line, on the dignity of the office?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think that he shows that every day in the decisions that he's making, the focus and the priorities he's laid out in his agenda. But he's not going to sit back and be attacked by the liberal media, Hollywood elites. And when they hit him, he's going to hit back.\nMajor.\nQ: I have a healthcare question, but on this, just one other aspect of it. Some have suggested in their tweet response or public announcements today that the President misconstrued one of the messages that should have been gathered from the shooting that involved Steve Scalise and others, the hostility of the verbal environment can create an atmosphere of violence. I'm not saying that, but members of Congress have said that about this particular tweet. I know that episode affected the President and those here at the White House personally, very importantly and deeply. Do you have any reaction to that sentiment, that conversations like this create an atmosphere that is either dangerous or one we need to avoid?\nMS. SANDERS: The President in no way form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence. If anything, quite the contrary. And he was simply pushing back and defending himself.\nQ: Sarah, I just had a healthcare question. So you talked about the President's overall priorities. Last night, late last night, as part of the amendment and evolution on the Senate draft, $45 million was put on the table for opioid treatment and health savings accounts can be used, according to this new draft, to pay premiums in the future. Does the President support those two initiatives, and why does he believe they make the bill better, specifically does he believe that opioid allocation will be sufficient, as many people do not, to address that problem?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to negotiate the details -- the back-and-forth in public, but I can tell you the President has obviously made fighting the opioid crisis a priority for him, and I would imagine he would be supportive of pushing resources towards that.\nQ: How about on health savings accounts? Does he have any particular approach --\nMS. SANDERS: I think we're always looking for ways to add additional flexibilities -- and something certainly to be considered.\nQ: Sarah, what about the Republicans who are criticizing the President?\nQ: Sarah, thank you. I want to go back to the shooting and remember what President Trump said then. He said, \"Our country will perhaps become closer, more unified, so important.\" Does his tweet this morning, his series of tweets help to unify the country?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, Kristen, I think I've asked and -- this question has been asked and I've answered it several times.\nQ: But do his tweets help to unify the country, to do what he said he wanted to see happen in the wake of that shooting?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, again, I think that the President is pushing back against people who attack him day after day after day. Where is the outrage on that? You guys are constantly coming and asking, like, is this okay -- he does it one time -- this is day after day after day. And it's not just the President --\nQ: He's the President of the United States, Sarah.\nMS. SANDERS: The only person that I see a war on is this President and everybody that works for him.\nQ: Sarah, two questions, to follow up on that. One is that I understand your point, but he's the President of the United States, they are cable news anchors. So he has to stand to a higher standard, one. And two, you talk about criticism, he said that former President Obama wasn't born in this country, right? So he clearly was a part of criticizing the past President, who was not immune to criticism himself. So I wonder how you make that argument.\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I think I've been pretty clear that when the President gets hit, he's going to hit back harder, which is what he did here today.\nQ: Doesn't he have to meet a higher standard than cable news anchors, Sarah? Doesn't he have to meet a higher standard than cable news anchors?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I don't think you can expect someone to be personally attacked day after day, minute by minute, and sit back. Look, the American people elected a fighter. They didn't elect somebody to sit back and do nothing. That's -- they knew what they were getting when they voted for Donald Trump, and he won overwhelmingly.\nQ: Sarah, how is insulting a woman on Twitter being a fighter?\nQ: What about the impact of statements like this on his effectiveness? There was a Maris poll this week that said 68 percent of registered voters say the President's tweets are reckless and distracting. Only 22 percent say that they're effective and informative. And Republicans on this question are split down the middle -- half of Republicans say that they're reckless and distracting. So how can you argue that this is something the President must do?\nMS. SANDERS: I answered this question yesterday in regards to the poll. I think any time the President has a chance to speak directly to the American people, it's a good thing.\nQ: Sarah, as a woman, how do you feel about the President attacking another woman specifically for her looks? And what does that show as an example to how men should be treating other women?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, everybody wants to make this an attack on a woman and a -- what about the constant attacks that he receives or the rest of us -- I'm a woman, and I've been attacked by this show multiple times. But I don't cry foul because of it. I think that you want to create this false narrative -- one hand it's like, let's treat everybody equally and on the other hand they attack, attack, attack, and he responds and apparently that's wrong.\nI'm sorry, guys, I've answered this question --\nQ: He's the President, Sarah.\nMS. SANDERS: Hallie.\nQ: Why can't he take the heat?\nQ: I just have a follow-up, Sarah, and then I have a separate question too. And this kind of gets to the point that's been made, and --\nMS. SANDERS: Exactly, this is the point that's been made so I'm not sure why we're continuing to answer the same question.\nQ: You've been talking about the idea that the President is a fighter. I just want to put it in -- because you talk about being personally affected by all of this as well, and that nothing is wrong with the President fighting fire with fire, is the argument that you're making. So I would ask this to you sort of on a personal level. You have stood here and talked about your family from this podium. Are you going to tell your kids this behavior is okay?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I've been asked before when it comes to role models -- as a person of faith, I think we all have one perfect role model. And when I'm asked that question I point to God, I point to my faith, and that's where I would tell my kids to look. None of us are perfect, and certainly there's only one that is, and that's where I would -- point that direction.\nQ: I want to ask you my follow-up, Sarah -- a follow-up question just on more policy points, with the G20 coming up next week.\nMS. SANDERS: That would be a change in tone, policy.\nQ: I disagree with that. I think we talk about policy a lot here.\nQ: I just did one about five minutes ago, Sarah.\nQ: But I want to ask about his meeting with President Putin that is coming up next week that has just been confirmed by Gary Cohn and H.R. McMaster, and a definitive answer from you on whether the President will bring up election interference. It is clearly the biggest topic between the U.S. and Russia right now, the fact that Moscow meddled in the election. Is the President going to press Putin on that?\nMS. SANDERS: Obviously I'm not going to get ahead of the President's conversation. As we typically do, I would imagine we'll have a readout after that conversation takes place.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks.\nMS. SANDERS: I'll come to you next.\nQ: Okay, thanks a lot, Sarah. The President's tweet today, does it help his legislative agenda? Does it help him win the votes of those nine senators who have come out against that Senate bill? Senator Collins, Senator Murkowski, for instance? What's your view on that?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I think we're just looking for new ways to rephrase this question. The President was attacked, he responded. There's nothing more I have to add than that.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: But as it relates to his legislative agenda -- I'm not asking about the tweet itself, I'm asking about whether or not this helps his legislative agenda.\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President would love for us all to focus on the legislative agenda a whole lot more. You look at the coverage over the last month of the extended period between May and June, all of the major networks, if you look at their coverage and what they're talking about, they spent one minute in the evening newscast talking about tax reform; three minutes on infrastructure; five minutes on the economy and jobs; 17 minutes on healthcare; and 353 minutes -- 353 minutes -- attacking the President and pushing a false narrative on Russia.\nI mean, look at that in comparison. If you guys want to talk about legislative agenda and focus on policy and priorities, you guys get to help set that table. And 353 minutes of attacks against the President and driving a false narrative, and one minute on tax reform -- that's over the course of a month. That's -- the numbers -- guys, the numbers don't lie. The media's focus on priorities, they don't line up with the rest of America.\nRight now we've got our economy is growing. The stock market is up. Unemployment is down. Jobs are back. And ISIS is on the run. America is winning, and that's what we like to talk about. But you guys constantly ignore that narrative.\nGo ahead, John.\nQ: All those points that you make, Sarah, about the --\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, John.\nQ: -- the positive elements of the President's agenda are certainly true. All of those things are true.\nBut the President today put out this tweet which takes away from all of that, and do you expect us here in this room to simply ignore that? Now, I think that's the valid question that should be asked of you right now. Should we just ignore this entirely?\nMS. SANDERS: I think he's put out a number of tweets on healthcare, on the immigration bills that will be in the House today, but that's not being talked about. That's not being asked about. But the discrepancy -- again, 353 minutes. You can't say that you want to talk about policy and then you look at the numbers, and they just don't lie. You can't expect for that amount of attack and intensity to come on a President and him to never respond.\nJohn Gizzi. I said I was going to John Gizzi next.\nQ: Two questions for you, Sarah. First, did the U.S., did the administration send a representative to the funeral mass for Chancellor Kohl? Or will they send anyone to the official funeral service July 1st?\nMS. SANDERS: I do believe that there is an official delegation. I'll have to get details back to you on that.\nQ: My other question is this: You've had people turn down nominations to be deputy secretary of the Treasury. The President is on his third appointee, I believe, for Secretary of the Army. And the ambassador to Ireland has declined the nomination, and there's no candidates for ambassador to Germany or France -- both major allies -- or Greece, for that matter, an important country. Is the President having trouble recruiting people to fill some of the key slots that remain unfilled after six months?\nMS. SANDERS: No, John. Actually, the trouble isn't in the recruitment, it's in the vetting and getting them through the process.\nLike I mentioned yesterday, there are over, I believe, a hundred candidates in the queue waiting to be pushed through. But due to the historic obstruction, it's taking much longer than normal to get a lot of those nominees through. And frankly, a lot of the people that are part of that process -- one of the number-one reasons we've had people take a step back is because that process is so lengthy.\nAnd, hold on, I've got a Skype question from Chris Berg in North Dakota, and we'll go to that.\nQ: Hey, Sarah. Thank you so much. I don't want to talk about any tweets. I want to talk about making America great again, and part of that energy dominance in Energy Week.\nHere's the thing: During the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, we had some pretty scary times in North Dakota. Just a couple weeks ago, a judge (inaudible) suggesting that the Army Corps of Engineers had prematurely issued some permits. This creates more uncertainty for people. My question is this: What specifically is the administration going to do to give these companies more certainty, more clarity as they make these multi-billion-dollar infrastructure investments to improve our energy? At the same point in time, our tribal leaders and tribal nations (inaudible) feeling honored and respected about this entire permitting process.\nMS. SANDERS: It was a little difficult to hear, but I believe the question was focused on energy production specific to Dakota Access, and I think we've been talking consistently about this. The President is dedicated to increasing energy production in the United States, and we're doing -- part of the review of the Dakota Access Pipeline is the administration working with those tribal leaders and stakeholders throughout that process to make it as successful as possible.\nA lot of the tribal leaders also want to expand energy production and development in their area, and we're going to work continuously with them to try to make that as successful as possible.\nJordan.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I want to ask you again about this Russia sanctions legislations in Congress. If, as Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said, the administration wants to go to the upper limits of the law in keeping those sanctions on Russia, then why not support this legislation that basically keeps what has been slapped down in place?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we're continuing to review that process until there's final legislation there.\nI've got another Skype question from Greg Meriwether in Louisiana. Hopefully we'll be able to hear him a little better.\nQ: Sarah, our question is on healthcare. Specifically, our governor put out a number that perhaps hundreds of thousands of people in Louisiana will lose their healthcare if this bill goes through. If you add up the other states, that kind of puts it into the (inaudible). Is there an acceptable number (inaudible) behind the scenes of people losing coverage to get the great bill through?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm having a little difficulty hearing. But as best I could understand, you're looking at how Obamacare repeal and replace would affect the state of Louisiana. And, I mean, frankly, Louisiana has been one of the hardest hit states in the country by Obamacare. Their insurance premiums have gone up over 125 percent. The goal here is to give people in the country choices. No one who currently has Medicaid will have their benefits cut. We're looking across the board the healthcare plans that will lower taxes, reduce premiums, and offer more choices for people in Louisiana and across the country. And hopefully that somewhat addressed your question as best I could.\nMargaret.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. I had a two-parter. The President had let us know that he had planned on having an ISIS news conference to update people on the situation within the next couple weeks, which is now-ish. But we're coming up on departure --\nMS. SANDERS: Is now-ish an official word?\nQ: Now-ish. I'm wondering, do you expect that we would get that update, whether it's a news conference or just kind of remarks before the upcoming foreign trip, or whether we need to wait?\nAnd I also wanted to ask you -- it looked like there might be some coverage of remarks at the fundraiser yesterday. It didn't work out. But beyond yesterday, are you guys looking at beginning to do that now for fundraisers of a certain size to have some transparency and the ability to hear what he's telling donors?\nMS. SANDERS: Yesterday it was a logistical issue trying to make that and accommodate at the last minute. It was going to be a little bit complicated. Certainly on the table for future events.\nAs for the first question, we'll keep you posted when we have an announcement on that.\nAs you guys know, the President is getting ready to depart for the Department of Energy and will be speaking on that soon.\nThanks so much.\nEND 2:51 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126597", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:31 P.M. EDT\nAIDE: Hi. Just want to restate the ground rules. Today's briefing is off camera, on the record, and the audio is not for broadcast. It is embargoed until the end of the briefing.\nAnd with that, I will turn the podium over to --\nQ: Can you make this on -- can you make the audio available? Because it puts radio at a disadvantage.\nAIDE: It is off camera, not for broadcast. Those are the ground rules.\nAnd now I'm going to turn it over to General H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn. Thank you.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Good afternoon, everybody. Next Wednesday, President Trump will depart on the second foreign trip of his administration. He will travel first to Warsaw, Poland to meet that country's leaders and speak to the Polish people. He will continue on to Hamburg, Germany for the G20 and for meetings with many world leaders.\nWhile this trip is short, the agenda is packed. I'll run through the objectives and the schedule, and then turn it over to Gary, who will walk you through the President's agenda for the G20.\nFirst of all, the primary objectives are three: To promote American prosperity, to protect American interests, and to provide American leadership. These three objectives tie together every engagement President Trump has with foreign leaders, whether here in the White House, as you saw with the strengthening of our strategic partnership with India during Prime Minister Modi's visit on Monday and we'll see tonight and tomorrow with the strengthening of our alliance with South Korea during President Moon's visit.\nAdditional objectives for the trip include, first, to strengthen American alliances. America First, as Gary and I have stressed in the past, does not mean America alone. President Trump has demonstrated a commitment to American alliances because strong alliances further American security and American interests.\nWhile there are no official NATO meetings on this trip, the President will meet with many NATO leaders, and he will reiterate both America's commitment to NATO's common defense and his expectation that all countries share responsibilities and burdens for that defense. We've seen countries strengthen their defense budgets in response to the President's call. When we all do more, our alliance becomes stronger and our countries are all more secure.\nSecond is to reassert who we are. Traveling to Europe, especially to Central Europe, which had its identity forcibly submerged for so long, is a great way to demonstrate what binds us together not just as an alliance, but as people. America has been influenced by many nations, but we share Europe's commitment to liberty and rule of law in particular.\nThird is to continue to forge a common understanding of threats. We saw the President make great progress in Saudi Arabia on denying terrorists safe havens, cutting off their funding, and discrediting their perverted ideology. He'll continue to build on that work while also addressing other threats, including attempts by revisionist powers to subvert the global order that undergirds our common security and economic prosperity.\nThe fourth is to develop a common approach to Russia. As the President has made clear, he'd like the United States and the entire West to develop a more constructive relationship with Russia. But he's also made clear that we will do what is necessary to confront Russia's destabilizing behavior.\nFifth is to expand economic opportunity for Americans. Did I skip -- I think I skipped -- no, okay. Again, I'll let Gary cover most of this, but from a foreign policy perspective the President's goal will be to make clear, even to our allies, that America cannot tolerate unfair trade and economic practices that disadvantage our workers and our industries. We're prepared to act where necessary, but we hope to resolve our differences in ways that benefit all sides and are based on really a drive toward reciprocal trade and economic relationships.\nThe sixth is energy. We want to create robust, open and fair markets that drive economic growth and leave no countries hostage to energy-market manipulation. We are committed to the energy security of our allies and partners, and to the diversification of energy sources, supplies and routes. The President's America First energy plan will help us achieve all of these objectives.\nThe seventh is environment and climate, which Gary will cover as well.\nNow, just a brief look at the schedule. In Poland, the President will meet with President Duda, the leader of a staunch NATO ally and of a nation that remains one of America's closest friends. He will speak to 12 Central European, Baltic, and Western Balkan leaders at the Three Seas Conference. His remarks will focus on infrastructure development and energy security, highlighting, for instance, the first shipments of American LNG into Poland earlier this month. He will also meet with Croatian President Grabar-Kitarovi? who is the co-host of the Three Seas Conference.\nThen he will give a major speech to the Polish people at Krasi?ski Square, epicenter of the 1944 Warsaw uprising against the brutal Nazi occupation. He will praise Polish courage throughout history's darkest hour, and celebrate Poland's emergence as a European Power. And he will call on all nations to take inspiration from the spirit of the Poles as we confront today's challenges. He will lay out a vision, not only for America's future relationship with Europe, but the future of our transatlantic alliance and what that means for American security and American prosperity.\nI'll let Gary cover the details of the G20. I'll just note that while in Hamburg, the President will meet with many world leaders, including Chancellor Merkel of Germany, the host of the G20, Prime Minister May of the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, President Moon of South Korea, President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, President Peсa Nieto of Mexico, President Jokowi of Indonesia, and Prime Minister Lee of Singapore, among others.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Gary.\nMR.COHN: Thank you. Thank you, H.R.\nLet me go through the G20 quickly, because there's a lot of overlap with what H.R. just talked about. I won't go through the individual meetings but I'll touch on the major broad themes here.\nThe President's primary objectives of these meetings is to work with our partners to jumpstart the world economy. Economic growth around the world has been far too weak for far too long. It's important that leading economies of the G7 take steps in their own countries to strengthen economic growth, but also to work together to address economic challenges that cross all of our borders.\nHere at home, the President has embarked on a strong pro-growth agenda featuring deregulation, tax reform, and infrastructure investment. On the trip, he will support G20 countries continuing to proactively use all the tools at their disposal -- monetary, fiscal, and structural -- to strengthen growth in their countries. Importantly, the G20 also needs to do more to address global imbalances, especially from overcapacity in industrial sectors.\nWhich brings me to trade, and I'll repeat something H.R. said: On trade, no less than on alliances, America First does not mean America alone. The goal of U.S. trade policy is to expand trade in a way that are free and fair. Insisting on fair trade is the best way to ensure the long-term strength of the international trading system. We look forward to engaging in free and fair trade with the G20 economies. The United States stands firm against all unfair trading practices, including massive distortions in the global steel market and other non-market practices that harm U.S. workers. We ask the G20 economies to join us in this effort and to take concrete actions to solve these problems. But let us be clear: We will act to ensure a level playing field for all.\nOn energy, the President remains committed to working with world leaders and private sectors on sound environmental policies and on innovative technologies. We have been mindful of the fact that, while renewables have a role to play, we cannot achieve the growth or anti-poverty agenda we want without strong contributions from clean fossil fuel technologies which, in the United States, is a global leader.\nOn climate, the President looks forward to discussing his decision to leave the Paris Agreement with the other G20 leaders. He'll make clear that he has decided to leave the agreement because it was a bad deal for the United States, but that he is open to reengaging in the agreement or a new agreement if it makes sense for the American people.\nAnother focus of the G20 will be famine and other global crises. We are focused on the crisis in South Sudan, Nigeria, Yemen, and Somalia, and recently announced that the United States would provide more than $329 million in additional humanitarian assistance in this crisis -- bringing the total U.S. humanitarian assistance here to nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2017. The United States is one of the largest donors of humanitarian assistance here. The assistance we provide represents the best of Americans' generosity and goodwill. It will also improve our national security by helping to stabilize insecure regions while building strong relations with nations and people around the world.\nFinally, the United States is pleased that the G20 will have a focus on women's economic empowerment. We believe that gender equality and women's empowerment is vital in today's labor market. We are advocating for more equality and equal access to the workplace, financial services, and the labor market with quality employment for women and men all throughout the world.\nWith that, General H.R. McMaster and myself are happy to take your questions.\nWell, that was quick. (Laughter.)\nQ: Hey, Gary. A couple of questions for both of you. One on Russia and one on climate. Can you talk about the meeting with President Putin? What are the President's objectives in that meeting? And will he bring up Russia's interference in the 2016 election? Either of you.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Well, there's no specific agenda. It's really going to be whatever the President wants to talk about. And that's -- and he will talk with many other leaders during the conference as well.\nQ: And does he want to talk about election interference? Is that something he plans to bring up?\nMR. COHN: We don't have an agenda set up for these meetings right now. As you know, these meetings are a week away. We're still finalizing schedules. So agendas for meetings have not been set up at this point.\nQ: Just on climate, I want to get you on that. Because Angela Merkel is now saying that she is not going to overlook tensions with the U.S. when it comes to the Paris Agreement. You noted just now, and the President has noted, he wants to renegotiate this Paris climate deal. In what concrete ways does he expect to do that, given what it took to get the deal in the first place?\nMR. COHN: Well, look the President has been very clear on climate and on Paris. He cares very much about the climate. He cares about the environment. But he has to enter into a deal that's fair for the American people, the American workers. He's done everything he's done based on job creation, economic growth in the United States.\nQ: Then what will he ask for?\nMR. COHN: He's going to ask for a fair and level playing field. We cannot be in a position where the United States is cutting and cutting emissions while other countries continue to grow until 2030. That doesn't seem like it's a fair and level playing field. We want a level playing field, just like everything else. We're looking for fairness across the board in the agreement.\nQ: Can I ask you about the Russia meeting a little bit, to follow up on that? Do you see that as a full-fledged meeting, as a bilateral, like we've been reading that the President wants? Or is it just a pull-aside? What's the format of the meeting?\nMR. COHN: Well, look, in the G20 meetings as a whole, the world leaders are gathered. We will have pull-asides, we'll have bilaterals. As I said, the schedule is being formalized right now. We would imagine that the countries that H.R. talked about, we would be planning on bilateral meetings. But they're during the G20 meetings. So these are not long, long meetings. These are bilateral pull-asides during the G20.\nQ: I want to follow up. Gary, in that sense -- because Merkel, May, Abe, Moon -- they all fall into a category where the President has had meetings with them before. I would assume you would have a formal agenda. Putin is different from that. Is the Putin one going to be a separate bilateral -- 10, 20, 30 minutes -- not just something that is a chance encounter in the context of the G20? That's what we're trying to drive at, that it doesn't fit into this other category. You have to --\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Indonesia is in that.\nMR. COHN: Indonesia is in it. Singapore is in there. There's countries at the G20 that, yes, we have met with before, some we'll meet with tonight for the first time, and there's other that we will have a second or third meeting with, and they're the countries that are important to us because of economic relationship, military relationship, a lot of different reasons for us having meetings with them. There will be a more formal schedule as we get closer. But I think you should assume that most of these countries we're going to have sort of bilateral meetings set up in advance -- probably not a formal agenda of what's on the schedule, but a formal agenda of what time these meetings will happen in a bilateral situation.\nQ: -- for Russia, as well?\nMR. COHN: Yes, yes.\nQ: So the President has laid out to NATO countries some of the things they need to do vis-а-vis meeting their 2 percent GDP investment in defense. Does he have a similar set of things to ask Moscow, to ask Putin -- to say, we need to see you do these trust-building measures before we can normalize relations?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Well, our relationship with Russia is not different from any other country in terms of us communicating to them, really, what our concerns are, where we see problems in the relationship, but also opportunities. Secretary Tillerson, obviously as he does with all countries in the world, has the lead for that and has been engaged in a broad, wide-ranging discussion about irritants, problems in the relationship, but also to explore opportunities -- where we can work together in areas of common interest.\nSo it won't be different from our discussions with any other country, really.\nQ: Given the assaults on press freedom by the ruling party in Poland, the Law and Justice Party, is the President concerned about assaults on a free press, and former communist countries backsliding as it were? And do you think that making this the first -- making Warsaw the first stop on the President's trip to Europe might send the wrong message, that he endorses such assaults on a free press?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: I don't think there's a danger of that at all. I think Poland is a clear choice for a number of reasons. First of all, it's one of our staunchest allies. It is a NATO ally that will meet and exceed its pledge to go over 2 percent from the Wales conference. It is in many ways a front-line NATO nation in connection with threats on the Eastern flank. It is a country that has partnered with us and had been a great ally during combat missions in Afghanistan and in Iraq, as well. And so this will be -- the President will emphasize themes about the past, what Poland has gone through as a nation, what they've achieved to fight to be part of Europe. He'll talk about what Poland is doing now and how our relationship can be strengthened in that context.\nBut what he's really going to talk about I think is also the future -- the future of America's relationship with Poland, with Europe, the importance of transatlantic relationships generally. In the economic context, what Gary has talked about, which is free and fair trade, access to energy.\nAnd so there are a lot of important things for us to emphasize in connection with the future of our relationship with Poland and with Europe.\nQ: Does any of that have to do with attacks on free press and free expression in Poland?\nMR. COHN: So let me just answer the question in G20 terms as well, because it's interesting -- in the G7 as well as the G20, we go through these arduous communiquй writings. And we as Americans have fought very vigorously to protect intellectual property rights and to protect freedom of speech in Internet. And we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to defend that. We did it in the G7 communiquй; we're going to do it in the G20 communiquй.\nSo that's just where we stand.\nYou back -- the young lady. Yeah, you.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. COHN: No, behind you. The young lady.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about this -- the comments you made about steel. As you know, they were expecting an omnibus trade deficit report by the end of the week, and there's also this ongoing 232 investigation by Commerce and Treasury. That seems to tee you up perfectly for a conversation with China and Japan about trade deficits. Do you plan on releasing that information ahead of the G20 and presenting it there?\nAnd then, secondly, on LNG, if you could just talk about -- will the President be offering or brokering any additional deals to backstop European needs in that respect to get them independent from Russia and a reliance on Russian energy?\nMR. COHN: So I'm not sure when the Commerce Department is going to release their final report on the steel industry and what's been going on there. They have been working on it for quite some period of time, so it's in draft or final drafting forms. They will be delivering it to the White House at some point.\nBut the premise of that report will -- we will use that as an opportunity to talk with many of our trading partners around the world. What's going on in steel -- I mentioned steel in my remarks specifically, because if you look at the G7 communiquй, there has been consensus among our G7 allies that there is overcapacity and there's dumping in steel. So I think there's uniformed consensus among all of our G7 allies that we do need to deal with the steel problem specifically.\nOn LNG, what the President is committed to do is the President is committed to have a deregulated environment here in the United States where LNG facilities can get licensed, we can license more pipeline systems so we can be in the business of exporting LNG. It's not the President's job to broker LNG supply contracts. It's the President's job to make sure that the U.S. authorizes facilities to be built in the United States because they need federal approval. And then once those facilities are built, hopefully those facilities enter into long-term supply contracts around the world. Because, uniquely, the rest of the world needs something we have, which is our huge supply of LNG.\nEamon, in the back.\nQ: Thanks, Gary. If you could, could you give us your sense of the state of the relationship between the United States and Germany right now? We've had a couple of smallish flash points recently. We see reports that Chancellor Merkel might be preparing to press the U.S. on Paris. We see this moment where Secretary Ross was cut off in mid-speech. How do you see the relationship right now between the United States and Germany?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Okay, the relationship with Germany is as strong as ever. And, of course, there are going to be differences in relations with any country, and we'll talk frankly about those differences. The President enjoys those conversations.\nBut what we should remember about a relationship with Germany and other allies is that we agree on 95 -- at least -- percent of the key issues, and we're cooperating every day on those issues. That cooperation, I think, is stronger than ever, and really our common concerns in security in economic development -- in our relationships economically.\nSo I think that -- to answer your question, the relationship is as strong as ever.\nQ: Do you see that as a snub of Secretary Ross?\nQ: Yes. In terms of --\nMR. COHN: We'll get you next.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: We'll get you next. Go ahead, sir.\nMR. COHN: Go ahead.\nQ: So in terms of the North Korean question, what more do you think that the President and this administration can do to pressure China? It seems like you have come to the point where you're realizing that China is not going to do more without more coercion, so what more can you do on that front?\nAnd then a second question, with regards to Russia: Do you feel like the President is taking seriously the question of Russian meddling in the 2016 election? And do you think -- and what has he done to actually address that issue, which a number of senior U.S. officials have raised as a threat on U.S. democracy?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: So, first of all, on North Korea and China's relationship with us and with others and working on the North Korea problem -- there are really three key things that came out of the Mar-a-Lago summit that I think are critical for us to build on.\nIt shouldn't really be about pressuring China, it should be about working with China in our common interests. The first big thing that came out of Mar-a-Lago was a recognition that a nuclear-armed North Korea with long-range missile capabilities is a threat not only to the United States, not only to South Korea and Japan, but also to China. And there was clear acknowledgement by both parties, the United States and in China on that.\nThe second is a recognition that while China's political influence with the regime might be limited, that they have tremendous coercive power in connection with the economic relationship and the trade relationships with North Korea. So China acknowledged that there is a lot that they can do in connection with convincing the North Korean regime that it's in their interest to denuclearize.\nAnd the third is critical -- is that we agreed on a joint objective of denuclearization of the Peninsula. That's a solid basis to work together on. There's a lot more to be done, however. The President has told all of us -- he has said that he will not tolerate a North Korean regime that can target the United States, that can reach the United States with a nuclear weapon. He just won't tolerate it.\nSo what we have is a commitment to deliver to him a broad range of options and to do our best to work with everyone, including China, on this. So it's not a question of pressuring China. It's a question of working with China to do more about this problem so it doesn't get to everybody wants to avoid.\nQ: Are we doing enough?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Well, I mean, none of us are doing enough. I don't think China is doing enough now because the problem is not resolved. So the question is, how much more must we do together to address this, short of a military solution. So that's the kind of discussions that we'll continue to have with Chinese leadership as we work together with them -- not pressuring them -- but working with them.\nOn the second point on Russia. The President has asked us to work together across all departments and agencies to do, really, three things: to confront Russia's destabilizing behavior -- whether it's cyber threats, whether it's political subversion here in Europe and elsewhere -- in the Balkans now. So confront Russia's destabilizing behavior and to come up with a strategy to do that.\nThe second is to deter Russia, right? Because the worse thing -- nobody wants a major power war, right? And so what is it that we have to put in place to be able to deter conflict.\nAnd then the third thing is to foster areas of cooperation. What are the areas that we can identify in which we can work together with Russia, which is clearly in both of our interests? And there are a lot of problems in the world that fall into that category. North Korea, for example, is one of them; the fight against transnational terrorist organizations is another. So the need to deescalate the Syrian civil war, to defeat ISIS there, and to end that humanitarian catastrophe.\nAnd so these are areas of discussion, again being led extremely well by Secretary of State Tillerson, and that will continue to be the focus of our Russia policy and strategy.\nQ: Okay, thank you, sir. You mentioned that the President will be speaking with the President of Poland. Will he also meet with other leaders of Polish political scene? And this speech in Warsaw is really highly anticipated. So what is the main message the President wants to deliver to the people of Poland?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Yeah, the main message is that America is with you, America understands that its interests align with the interests of the Polish people, and we are determined to do our best to work together on our common priorities and our common interests.\nAcross the three areas -- the three main themes that I mentioned at the beginning -- which is, first, to protect our security -- this is Polish security, American security, our common security; to promote prosperity in terms of economic growth and development, and economic growth and development in a way that protects the environment, that advances our interests in the economic energy realm. And the third is to provide American leadership -- American leadership to help connect Poland broadly, to keep Poland connected to what they fought for for so long, which is to be part of Europe. And for American leadership to be associated with the Polish-American relationship, the American-European relationship, and transatlantic relations generally.\nMR. COHN: And, yes, he's speaking to other Polish leaders. I've got to run to Energy Week. I'm on a panel at 2:00. I can take one last question.\nRight there.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Cohn.\nMR. COHN: You're welcome, sir.\nQ: Very quickly, is the IMF going to come up at all when the meeting is held? During the IMF World Bank meeting earlier this year there was considerable discussion that there's been nothing said from the administration about the IMF and whether the U.S. would continue the same policy which directly connects us to the bailout in Greece.\nMR. COHN: Look, I don't think the IMF directly will come up during the G20. The IMF will be there. They're one of the participants at the G20. That said, I'm having discussions with IMF leadership, and we've got very amicable discussions with IMF going on.\nQ: Madam Lagarde?\nMR. COHN: Yes. Okay, thank you, everyone.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Thanks, everybody.\nEND 1:48 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-06-29", "title": "Press Briefing by National Security Advisor General H.R.

In his remarks, he referred to Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, who is accused in the murder of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco, CA, on July 1, 2015; Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly; and Robert E. Murray, president and chief executive officer, Murray Energy Corp.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126551", "text": "The President. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. How are you?\nWell, I want to thank everybody on stage. They are really a terrific team. We have some of the real winners in the audience too, that I can tell you, some great, great people.\nI want to thank Vice President Pence. As always, he's right there, and he is—really been a help to this administration. And we have some big things happening today, and we have some very big things happening over the next month and, I guess, probably I can say over the next 8 years. I suspect I can say that.\nIt's wonderful to be here with so many pioneers and visionaries from America's energy industry. Great industry. I want to thank the leaders of our great energy companies for joining us today and for supporting our efforts to bring true wealth and prosperity to our people. I also—[applause]—that's true. Come on, give yourself a hand. You deserve it. You deserve it. You've gone through 8 years of hell, and actually, I could say even a little bit more than that. You deserve it.\nI also want to express our sincere gratitude to the labor union leaders and members who have joined us today. Thank you, fellas. Thank you, thank you. Your workers embody the skill, grit, and courage that has always been the true source of American strength. They are great people. They break through rock walls, mine the depths of the earth, and reach through the ocean floor to bring every ounce of energy into our homes and commerce and into our lives. Our Nation salutes you. You're brave and you are great workers. Thank you very much. Thank you, fellas.\nBefore turning to the topic at hand, I want to provide a brief update on two crucial votes taking place this afternoon on the House floor. Very important. These bills are vital to public safety and national security, and I want to thank Chairman Bob Goodlatte for his efforts. Bob has been working very hard and really for a long time, but we got it going.\nFirst, the House will be voting on Kate's Law, legislation named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant with five prior deportations and lots of bad things on his record.\nThe second is the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which blocks Federal grants to cities that release dangerous criminal aliens back into the streets, including the vicious and disgusting and horrible MS-13 gang members. And we're getting them out. We are getting them out. They're going fast.\nGeneral Kelly and his whole group, they've gotten rid of 6,000 so far. We're about 50 percent there, and we're actually liberating towns. Like on Long Island, where I grew up—we're liberating towns. Those people are so happy to see our guys, and our guys are a lot tougher than the MS-13 characters. That I can tell you. Liberation.\nAnd I'm calling on all lawmakers to put the safety of American families first. And let's pass these bills through the House, through the Senate, and send them to my desk. I will give you the fastest approval, the fastest signature that you have ever seen. Right, Mike? We will get that signed so fast. And—so when we get back, the first thing I'm going to do is how did we do on the vote? I expect good things; otherwise, I probably wouldn't be talking about it right now to be honest with you. I'd just sort of low-key it a little bit. [Laughter] I don't like losing. I don't like losing. [Laughter] Neither do you folks. Every Member of Congress should vote to save American lives. Many great Members of Congress are here with us this afternoon, some great people, some great, great people. Thank you very much. Not only are they working with us on border security, but they share our desire to unleash American energy.\nI especially want to thank Secretary Perry for his tremendous leadership in this department. He has really done a terrific job, and he's also a cheerleader; he's really a cheerleader. I watched that in Texas. The thing I loved about him, he was always saying how great Texas was. And if you don't say it, I don't know. You've got to say it, right?\nSecretary of Energy J. Richard Perry. Sure.\nThe President. And you're doing it right now with energy.\nSecretary Perry. Ain't bragging if you can do it.\nThe President. That's true.\nAlong with Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. And we've been through our battles, Scott. Not with each other, with the world. And now the world is starting to say I think they're right. [Laughter] They'll find out. We have no doubt. But all three of them strongly believe in putting America first, which is what I believe in, which is why I got elected. It's called \"make America great again.\" That's what we're doing. Make America great again.\nWe're here today to usher in a new American energy policy, one that unlocks million and millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in wealth. For over 40 years, America was vulnerable to foreign regimes that used energy as an economic weapon. Americans' quality of life was diminished by the idea that energy resources were too scarce to support our people. We always thought that, and actually, at the time, it was right to think. We didn't think we had this tremendous wealth under our feet. Many of us remember the long gas lines and the constant claims that the world was running out of oil and natural gas.\nAmericans were told that our Nation could only solve this energy crisis by imposing draconian restrictions on energy production. But we now know that was all a big, beautiful myth. It was fake. Don't we love that term, \"fake\"? What we've learned about fake over the last little while—fake news. [Laughter] CNN—fake. [Laughter] Whoops, their camera just went off. [Laughter] Okay, you can come back. I won't say—I promise I won't say anything more about you. I see that red light go off, I say, whoa. The truth is that we have near-limitless supplies of energy in our country. Powered by new innovation and technology, we are now on the cusp of a true energy revolution.\nOur country is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance, which we didn't know of even 5 years ago and certainly 10 years ago. We have nearly 100 years' worth of natural gas and more than 250 years' worth of clean, beautiful coal. We are a top producer of petroleum and the number-one producer of natural gas. We have so much more than we ever thought possible. We are really in the driving seat. And you know what? We don't want to let other countries take away our sovereignty and tell us what to do and how to do it. That's not going to happen. With these incredible resources, my administration will seek not only the American energy independence that we've been looking for so long, but American energy dominance.\nAnd we're going to be an exporter—exporter. We will be dominant. We will export American energy all over the world, all around the globe. These energy exports will create countless jobs for our people and provide true energy security to our friends, partners, and allies all across the globe.\nBut this full potential can only be realized when Government promotes energy development—that's this guy right here, and he'll do it better than anybody—instead of obstructing it like the Democrats. They obstructed. But we get through it. We cannot have obstruction. We have to get out and do our job better and faster than anybody in the world, certainly when it comes to one of our great assets: energy. This vast energy wealth does not belong to the Government. It belongs to the people of the United States of America. Yet, for the past 8 years, the Federal Government imposed massive job-killing barriers to American energy development.\nSince my very first day in office, I have been moving at record pace to cancel these regulations and to eliminate the barriers to domestic energy production like never before. Job-killing regulations are being removed and vital infrastructure projects are being approved at a level that they've never seen before. As you all know, I approved the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline in my first week. Thousands of jobs, tremendous things are happening. And by the way, I thought I'd take a lot of heat. I didn't take any heat. I approved them, and that was it. I figured we'd have all sorts of protests. We didn't have anything.\nBut I have to do—whether it's protesting or not—I have to do what's right. But people celebrate those two transactions, as opposed to protesting. But sometimes, you have to go out and just do it, and you find out. Whatever happens, happens. But you have to be right for the American people. [Applause] Thank you.\nI'm dramatically reducing restrictions on the development of natural gas. I canceled the moratorium on a new coal leasing—and you know what was happening—the new coal leasing on Federal lands, it was being so terribly restricted. And now with Ryan and with a group, it's going to be open, and the land will be left in better shape than it is right now. Is that right? Better shape.\nWe have finally ended the war on coal. And I am proud to report that Corsa Coal, here with us today, just opened a brandnew coal mine in the State of Pennsylvania, the first one in many, many, many years. Corsa, stand up. Come on. Congratulations. Congratulations. Employing a lot of people, and we are putting the coal miners back to work just like I promised—just like I promised when I went through Ohio and West Virginia, Wyoming, and all of the different places. And I see Bob back there. Congratulations, Bob. He's in great shape, right? You in good shape, Bob? Right from the beginning. Good. You just take care of yourself, all right?\nWe're ending the intrusive EPA regulations that kill jobs, hurt family farmers and ranchers, and raise the price of energy so quickly and so substantially. In order to protect American jobs, companies, and workers, we've withdrawn the United States from the one-sided Paris climate accord. And I won't get into it, but believe me, that really put this country at a disadvantage. Number one, we weren't playing on the same field. It kicked in for us, and it doesn't kick in for others. The money that we had to pay was enormous. It was not even close. And maybe we'll be back into it someday, but it will be on better terms. It will be on fair terms, not on terms where we're the people that don't know what we're doing.\nSo we'll see what happens. But I will tell you, we're very proud of it. And when I go around, there are so many people that say thank you. You saved the sovereignty of our country. You saved our wealth, because we would have a hard time getting to this newfound wealth. And that's not going to happen with our country.\nToday I am proudly announcing six brandnew initiatives to propel this new era of American energy dominance. First, we will begin to revive and expand our nuclear energy sector—which I'm so happy about—which produces clean, renewable, and emissions-free energy. A complete review of U.S. nuclear energy policy will help us find new ways to revitalize this crucial energy resource. And I know you're very excited about that, Rick.\nSecond, the Department of the Treasury will address barriers to the financing of highly efficient, overseas coal energy plants. Ukraine already tells us they need millions and millions of metric tons right now. And there are many other places that need it too. And we want to sell it to them and to everyone else all over the globe who need it.\nThird, my administration has just approved the construction of a new petroleum pipeline to Mexico, which will further boost American energy exports, and that will go right under the wall, right? It's going under, right? [Laughter] We'll have it go down a little deeper in that one section, you know, a little like this. Right under the wall.\nFourth, just today, a major U.S. company, Sempra Energy, signed an agreement to begin negotiations for the sale of more American natural gas to South Korea. And as you know, the leaders of South Korea are coming to the White House today, and we've got a lot of discussion to do. But we will also be talking about them buying energy from the United States of America, and I'm sure they'll like to do it. They need it. Thank you.\nFifth, the United States Department of Energy is announcing today that it will approve two long-term applications to export additional natural gas from the Lake Charles LNG terminal in Louisiana. It's going to be a big deal. It's a great announcement.\nFinally, in order to unlock more energy from the 94 percent of offshore land closed to development—under the previous administration, so much of our land was closed to development—we're opening it up, the right areas, but we're opening it up—we're creating a new offshore oil and gas leasing program. America will be allowed to access the vast energy wealth located right off our shores. And this is all just the beginning, believe me.\nThe golden era of American energy is now underway. And I'll go a step further: The golden era of America is now underway. Believe me. And you're all going to be a part of it in creating this exciting new future. We will bring new opportunity to the heartland, new prosperity to our inner cities, and new infrastructure all across our Nation. When it comes to the future of America's energy needs, we will find it, we will dream it, and we will build it.\nAmerican energy will power our ships, our planes, and our cities. American hands will bend the steel and pour the concrete that brings this energy into our homes and that exports this incredible, newfound energy all around the world. And American grit will ensure that what we dream and what we build will truly be second to none. We will be number one again all the way. We're going to make America great again.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-06-29", "title": "Remarks on Efforts To Promote Domestic Energy Production"}

Today I applaud the House for passing two crucial measures to save and protect American lives. These were bills I campaigned on and that are vital to our public safety and national security. The first bill, Kate's Law, increases criminal penalties for illegal immigrants who repeatedly reenter the country illegally. The bill is named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times. Every year, countless Americans are victimized, assaulted, and killed by illegal immigrants who have been deported multiple times. It is time for these tragedies to end.\nThe second bill, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, restricts taxpayer grant money to cities that prevent their police from turning over dangerous criminal aliens to Federal authorities. Sanctuary cities are releasing violent criminals, including members of the bloodthirsty MS-13 gang, back onto our streets every single day. Innocent Americans are suffering unthinkable violence as a result of these cities' reckless actions. The House bill also includes what is known as Grant's Law and Sarah's Law. These provisions, which prevent the release of dangerous criminals awaiting removal proceedings, are named for two slain Americans whoseparents I spent time with during the campaign.\nThe implementation of these policies will make our communities safer. Opposing these bills, and allowing dangerous criminals back into our communities, our schools, and the neighborhoods where our children play, puts all of us at risk.\nNow that the House has acted, I urged the Senate to take up these bills, pass them, and send them to my desk.

Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the \"1974 Act\") (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2463(a)(1)(A)), the President may, after receiving the advice of the United States International Trade Commission (the \"Commission\"), designate certain articles as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) when they are imported from designated beneficiary developing countries.\n2. Pursuant to sections 501, 503(a)(1)(A), and 503(b)(5) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(b)(5)), and having received advice from the Commission in accordance with section 503(e) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), I have determined to designate certain articles as eligible articles when they are imported from beneficiary developing countries.\n3. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(1)), the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit application of the duty-free treatment accorded to specified articles under the GSP when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries.\n4. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)), I have determined to withdraw the application of duty-free treatment accorded to a certain article.\n5. Section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)) subjects beneficiary developing countries, except those designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries or beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries as provided in section 503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(D)), to competitive need limitations on the preferential treatment afforded to eligible articles under the GSP.\n6. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that in 2016 certain beneficiary developing countries exported eligible articles in quantities exceeding the applicable competitive need limitations. I hereby terminate the duty-free treatment for such articles from such beneficiary developing countries.\n7. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) provides that the President may disregard the competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of the imports of any such article into the United States during the preceding calendar year does not exceed the amount set forth in section 503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).\n8.

Section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(1)) provides that the President may waive the application of the competitive need limitations in section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if certain conditions are met.\n10. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have received the advice of the Commission on whether any industry in the United States is likely to be adversely affected by such waivers of the competitive need limitations provided in section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act. I have determined, based on that advice and the considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, and having given great weight to the considerations in section 503(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(2)), that such waivers are in the national economic interest of the United States. Accordingly, I have determined that the competitive need limitations of section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act should be waived with respect to a certain eligible article from a certain beneficiary developing country.\n11. Presidential Proclamation 8997 of June 27, 2013, suspended Bangladesh's designation as a beneficiary developing country for the purposes of the GSP. Presidential Proclamation 9333 of September 30, 2015, terminated Venezuela's designation as a beneficiary developing country for the purposes of the GSP. These proclamations made corresponding modifications to general note 4 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Those modifications included technical errors, and I have determined that modifications to the HTS are necessary to correct them.\n12. Presidential Proclamation 9466 of June 30, 2016, implemented the World Trade Organization Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products (the \"Declaration\") and, pursuant to section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)), modified the HTS to include the schedule of duty reductions necessary to carry out the Declaration. Those modifications included technical errors, and I have determined that modifications to the HTS are necessary to correct them.\n13. Presidential Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006, implemented modifications to the HTS, pursuant to section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the \"1988 Act\") (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)), to include changes to the schedule considered necessary or appropriate by the Commission to accomplish the purposes of section 1205(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005(a)). Those modifications to the HTS were set out in Publication 3898 of the Commission, entitled \"Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States under Section 1206 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988,\" which was incorporated by reference into Presidential Proclamation 8097. Annex I to that publication included a technical error, and I have determined that a modification to the HTS is necessary to correct it.\n14. Presidential Proclamation 9549 of December 1, 2016, implemented modifications to the HTS, pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, to include changes to the schedule considered necessary or appropriate by the Commission to accomplish the purposes of section 1205(a) of the 1988 Act. Those modifications to the HTS were set out in Publication 4653 of the Commission, entitled \"Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States under Section 1206 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 and for Other Purposes,\" which was incorporated by reference into Presidential Proclamation 9549. Annex I to that publication included technical errors, and I have determined that modifications to the HTS are necessary to correct them.\n15. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that:\n(1) In order to designate certain articles as eligible articles when imported from a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for the corresponding HTS subheadings is modified as set forth in section A of Annex I to this proclamation.\n(2) In order to provide that one or more countries should no longer be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to one or more eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for the corresponding HTS subheadings and general note 4(d) to the HTS are modified as set forth in sections B, C, and D of Annex I to this proclamation.\n(3) The competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act is disregarded with respect to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and to the beneficiary developing countries listed in Annex II to this proclamation, effective July 1, 2017.\n(4) A waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act shall apply to the article in the HTS subheading and to the beneficiary developing country set forth in Annex III to this proclamation, effective July 1, 2017.\n(5) In order to make technical corrections necessary to reflect the suspension of benefits under the GSP with respect to Bangladesh and the termination of benefits under the GSP with respect to Venezuela, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex IV to this proclamation.\n(6) In order to make technical corrections necessary to provide the intended tariff treatment to goods covered by the Declaration in accordance with Presidential Proclamation 9466 of June 30, 2016, and to certain goods as recommended in Publications 3898 and 4653 of the Commission, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex V.\n(7) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annexes I, IV, and V to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates set forth in the relevant sections of Annexes I, IV, and V.\n(8) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nDONALD J.

{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126588", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:30 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Happy Friday. I have just a couple things I want to highlight here at the top before we get into questions. We had another bad Obamacare news piece come out today out of Ohio. Premier Health Plan is withdrawing from the state's exchange, leaving 20 more counties with no insurance plans on the Obamacare exchange. That's on top of the 14 bare counties in Nevada we talked about yesterday.\nFor the thousands of Americans now left with no choice when it comes to health insurance, these announcements are more than just words and numbers -- it means that they will have to make tough choices when it comes to medical care for themselves and their families.\nThe President is determined to give these families a better option. News like this is why it's so important we repeal this failed law before it collapses completely.\nEarlier today, Agriculture Secretary Perry -- I'm sorry, Perdue sliced a Nebraska prime rib at a ceremony in China, formally marking the return of American beef to the $2.5 billion Chinese market after a 13-year hiatus. I strongly encourage you all to take a look at the pictures of the Secretary and representatives from the American and Chinese industries standing around a pretty tasty-looking piece of prime rib, particularly going into this holiday weekend. This is great news for American ranchers who now have access to the $2.5 billion Chinese beef market.\nAlso this morning, the Department of Health and Human Services announced approximately $15 million that will be going to women, infants, and their families who have had or are at risk for lead exposure in Flint, Michigan.\nPresident Trump promised during the campaign that he would address Flint's water crisis quickly and effectively, and his Cabinet is hard at work keeping that promise to the people of Flint.\nIn the VA, Secretary Shulkin was in New York to unveil the LUKE bionic arm, the world's most advanced commercial prosthetic that was made possible by VA research. The LUKE arm is the product of nearly eight years of testing and research, and represents the amazing advances in technology that are possible when the government works in partnership with the private sector to care for our nation's heroes.\nThe LUKE arm has the potential to significantly benefit the lives of veterans and others with upper extremity amputations, and the Trump administration was proud to be part of its rollout today.\nFinally, yesterday John Gizzi asked if the United States was sending a delegation to the funeral service of the former German chancellor on the 1st of July, and I wanted to give an update, as I said I would get back. We are sending an official delegation, which will be headed by the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, who is the former United States Ambassador to Germany.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions. And, folks, in honor of the Fourth of July, let's try to save all our fireworks for Tuesday. (Laughter.)\nJohn Roberts.\nQ: Sarah, the President tweeted this morning about healthcare.\nMS. SANDERS: He did.\nQ: In which he said that if the senators can't get a bill on repeal and replace together, then maybe the best idea would be -- as Ben Sasse and Rand Paul have suggested -- split them up into a repeal and then a replacement later. This really runs counter to what the President has been promoting all through the campaign and earlier this year where he insisted that the two things had to be done, if not simultaneously, at least very close to each other. What is the basis for his change in thinking on this particular point?\nMS. SANDERS: The President hasn't changed his thinking at all. I mean, he's campaigned on, talked about since he was elected repealing and replacing Obamacare. We're still fully committed to pushing through with the Senate at this point. But we're looking at every possible option of repealing and replacing Obamacare. We are focused on doing that.\nAs I said earlier, there is another large amount of counties that now have no Obamacare provider, and so we're continuing to work hard to repeal and replace Obamacare, and that hasn't changed.\nQ: So how does it square this idea with repeal it now, replace it later with what you had said on repeated occasions before that these things needed to be done very close to each other in order to maintain continuity of coverage for many Americans?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we're still focused on trying to push through where are, and we're going to continue moving forward and making progress on that front and looking at repealing and replacing Obamacare. The bottom line is, we're focused on the end product here, and that is to repeal and replace Obamacare with healthcare that works for all Americans.\nGlenn.\nQ: Sarah, in terms of putting some more specifics on the replacement part, one of the issues that they're having is you got 11 or 12 senators now who are not happy with what's going on with Medicaid -- they can deal with some of the repeal elements. Can you give us the most specific -- you were asked about this a couple of days ago -- the most specific articulation of what you want to see in terms of Medicaid? And do you agree with some of these senators who think what's in the Senate bill, in terms of Medicaid phasing out, is, to point a phrase, too mean?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President, again, is very focused on protecting those who are currently in the program. That's certainly a big priority for him, is making sure those people are protected and also adding additional resources. That's part of the Senate bill as it currently stands. That's something we would be most likely supportive of doing.\nQ: How about sort of the specifics outlined in the CBO about the potential for, you know, 18 million -- what is it -- 23 million total, 15 million by next year. Is that just too steep a drop-off for the President?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: In terms of the CBO articulation analysis of what would happen under Medicaid over the next three or four years, is that too steep a drop off in terms of Medicaid? Does the President have any objection to what was in the Senate bill with regards to Medicaid?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had a direct conversation about a specific number. Again, the priority is to protect everyone as best as possible and certainly those that are currently on the plan, and making sure that no one that is currently on that program gets taken off.\nQ: I'd like to follow up with that first. Where did the President actually get the idea of separating them? Was it through conversations with Senator Paul, or was it something that Senator Ben Sasse had said on the television program?\nMS. SANDERS: I know people have been talking about this for quite some time. I don't know where, specifically, it may have come from. But again, I've heard people talking about it for months. I don't think it's new.\nBlake.\nQ: And then I wanted to ask about the Election Commission. Does the President have any thoughts on the fact that so many governors and other state officials have said they're not going to comply with this request for public information for the Election Integrity Commission?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that that's mostly a political stunt. We're asking -- this is a commission that's asking for publicly available data. And the fact that these governors wouldn't be willing to turn that over -- this is something that's been part of the Commission's discussion, which has bipartisan support, and none of the members raised any concern whatsoever.\nBlake.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Let me expand upon the tweet that John had brought up. You just answered his question in part by saying we're still focused on trying to push through where we are; the bottom line is we're focused on the end product here. Is this potential splitting up of the bill, is that plan B at this point?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, again, as I've said before earlier this week. We're not focused on plan B, we're focused on the overall process of repealing and replacing Obamacare. And the end result right now -- we're still very much focused on the direction we're on.\nQ: And Ben Sasse said in his letter, and on television had mentioned, the first Monday coming back -- which is either -- I believe it's July 10th -- as to the date as to when they should do it. Does the White House ascribe to that date?\nMS. SANDERS: No. As we've said before, we're less focused on the timeline and, again, focused on making sure we get the best deal and healthcare plan possible.\nJustin.\nQ: I wanted to ask about two separate policy things. The first one is steel. The President said today that he had secured some assurances from the Koreans on that. I'm wondering if those were actual changes that we might see to KORUS or other trade agreements, or if it's more \"we'll look at it and get back to you\" type of assurance. And then, broadly, if the report in -- this morning was correct in that the President has determined he's going to impose tariffs on steel.\nMS. SANDERS: No, at this point the President has not made a final decision in regards to the tariffs issue.\nQ: And on Korea?\nMS. SANDERS: On Korea, look, the President has been clear throughout the campaign and again during now, he's looking for the best deal possible for American workers, specifically focused on reciprocal trade. And that is the primary focus of the conversations that he's had.\nQ: And then I have one on food aid.\nMS. SANDERS: Sorry, on what?\nQ: Food aid.\nMS. SANDERS: Okay.\nQ: The President is moving to require all food aid to be sent on U.S. flag carriers, but it's a policy that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have actually been moving away towards. AEI, which is not a liberal group, said that it would make food aid costs 46 percent more, it may take 14 weeks longer to reach people, unlikely to create new U.S. jobs. We heard yesterday from senior administration officials about the President sees foreign aid as an important part of diplomacy and wants to cut costs here. So I'm just trying to figure out how this is not just kind of a bumper sticker strategy, but why this is actually a good idea for the United States.\nMS. SANDER: I'm sorry, what was the last part?\nQ: Why this isn't just a bumper sticker strategy of, you know, we're putting it on U.S. ships, but why this actually makes sense from a policy standpoint.\nMS. SANDERS: That's something, honestly, I haven't had a chance to dive into much, Justin. But I'd be happy to circle back with you later today.\nMajor.\nQ: Sarah, just to be clear, the preference of the White House is to go forward with the drafting of a repeal and replace in the Senate and see if that can pass. That's the correct position of the White House, right?\nMS. SANDERS: Correct, yes.\nQ: And so this idea of separating the two is only a backup, as an emergency, if this other process fails, correct?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think we want --\nQ: The reason I ask --\nMS. SANDERS: No, I understand.\nQ: Is because if you take -- if you separate them, as you know, one is reconciliation and the other one isn't, which makes it much more difficult, and for people as you've identified in Nevada and Ohio, repeal only takes care of one of their problems. It doesn't deal with them being able to find new carriers or alternative plans as the replacement would. So I'm just trying to figure out how much of an idea this really is that we should be focusing on, or should this attention still be on repeal and replace as the primary White House focus.\nMS. SANDERS: As I said earlier, the primary focus is repeal and replace through the current Senate legislation that is being discussed.\nQ: If you did separate them, it would complicate things. Not only legislatively --\nMS. SANDERS: I didn't say that that's true.\nQ: What is -- I'm asking.\nMS. SANDERS: I think that's something we would have to review if we went that direction. But at this point, again, we're focused on the piece of legislation that does exist.\nQ: What does the President think about the idea of the cancellation of recess in August to focus on healthcare and other legislative ideas and agenda items? That's something 10 Republican senators suggested today.\nMS. SANDERS: Not cancelling the August recess?\nQ: Cancelling the recess, staying in town, and working on healthcare and the sort of issues -- the debt ceiling, tax cuts. Would the President endorse that?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had a chance to have a conversation whether or not he wants to push Congress to cancel their recess. I think that the timeline and that is really something that's up to Congress, not the White House.\nQ: On Chicago, with the ATF permanent taskforce there, is that a suggestion or a recognition that at least part of the problem in Chicago is a gun control problem or a firearms access control problem?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the problem there is pretty clear that it's a crime problem. I think crime is probably driven more by morality than anything else. So I think that this is a law enforcement issue, and our focus is trying to add additional support.\nWe've talked to people on a local level and asked for their input on how we best can be helpful, and that's exactly what we're trying to do. That's something the President talked about pretty extensively, and he's focused on trying to help the people in Chicago.\nAlex.\nQ: At his recent rally in Cedar Rapids, President Trump said the situation in the Middle East is worse than it was 16 years ago. Is he concerned about how long the war in Afghanistan is dragging on for?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think he, as well as others, are always concerned about any war taking place. He is deferring as much as possible to the generals that he put in place, his national security team to do everything we can to limit those types of things, but at the same time protect Americans and certainly our national security.\nQ: Does he want to see Americans in a combat role there by, say, 2020?\nMS. SANDERS: As we've said many times before, the President is never going to broadcast what plans he has or doesn't have.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. With all the furor and tumult in yesterday's press conference -- or press briefing, some have suggested that maybe it is time for the President to have another news conference and perhaps answer these questions himself, rather than subject spokespeople such as you and Sean to questions about recent controversy. Does he plan an actual news conference in the near future?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure if there's one on the schedule. But if there is, I guarantee you this room will be the first group to be notified. (Laughter.)\nQ: The other thing is -- my other question is: Has the President today read The New York Magazine article by Gabriel Sherman about the White House and its involvement with Joe Scarborough at all?\nMS. SANDERS: I have no idea if he's read that piece. Sorry, John, can't answer that.\nNoah.\nQ: Back to the question of trade, the President said today that he was negotiating with South Korea on the agreement. Has the KORUS agreement been reopened? And if it has been reopened, what's the mechanism for that? And how much concern, if any, is there about impacting other relationships, security relationships with South Korea?\nMS. SANDERS: At the direction of the President, Ambassador Lighthizer is calling a special joint committee meeting to start the process of renegotiating and amending the deal. And as always, and as we've said many times before, the President is committed to making sure he gets the best deal and a better deal if possible when it comes to trade. And that's the current status of where they are.\nQ: Any impact on the cooperation over North Korean aggression with South Korea?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: What concern is there about an impact on the cooperation with South Korea on the military issues and security issues with North Korea?\nMS. SANDERS: Are you asking if we're concerned about an impact?\nQ: Yes. Yes, yes.\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President laid out pretty clearly where he is on that in his statement earlier today.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sarah. I wanted to ask you about the travel ban. It's the first full day that it's gone into effect, and it's scheduled to last for 90 days. And my question has to do with what are the next steps. If it lasts for 90 days, that takes you up to the end of September. Are there plans to extend the travel ban before this issue reaches the U.S. Supreme Court?\nMS. SANDERS: As of right now, for any specifics about the implementation process and anything beyond that, I would encourage you to contact the Department of Homeland Security, as they'll be doing the review and recommendation on that process.\nAnd, guys, I'm sorry, I know I was running late, and I hate to end early, but I was notified by note here just --\nQ: Just two quick questions here.\nMS. SANDERS: Hold on a second, I'm trying to finish a sentence -- that the President is actually going to sign an executive order, and he's going to do that in the next few minutes. And so I'm going to step away.\nWe will be available this afternoon to answer more questions.\nQ: On what?\nMS. SANDERS: On the Space Council. And we'll send out more details about that here in the next few minutes.\nThanks, guys.\nEND 2:46 P.M.

Many of these illegal immigrants had extensive criminal records and had been repeatedly deported. Every single one of these deaths was preventable.\nThese beautiful American lives were stolen because our Government refused to do its job. If the Government had simply enforced our immigration laws, these Americans would still be alive today. That's why, since the day I took the oath of office, I have been restoring the enforcement of our immigration laws and the protection and defense of our borders.\nThese courageous Americans joined me at the White House to call on Congress to pass two bills that I campaigned on during the election. If enacted, these bills will save countless Americans lives. The first bill, Kate's Law, is named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times. This law will enhance criminal penalties for those who repeatedly reenter our country illegally. The second bill, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, will block Federal grants to jurisdictions that shield dangerous criminal aliens from being turned over to Federal law enforcement.\nOn Thursday, I am glad to report, these two bills passed the House of Representatives. This represents a crucial step toward ensuring our public safety and national security. I want to thank Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte for his dedicated work on these critical bills, as well as other crucial legislation that will soon be considered as well. I also thank leadership for advancing these lifesaving measures.\nI now call on the Senate to take up these bills and send them back to my desk for signature as soon as possible. We need security. We need safety in our country. And I call on all members of both parties to stand united with victims to stop these terrible and senseless crimes from ever happening in the first place.\nThis legislation presents a simple choice: either vote to save and protect American lives or vote to shield and comfort criminal aliens who threaten innocent lives. And they've been shielded too long.\nAs we head towards the Fourth of July, we remember now more than ever to cherish our freedom. The foundation of freedom is the rule of law. It forms the bedrock of our Constitution and the cornerstone of our way of life.\nSo this Independence Day, while we're enjoying treasured time with our friends and loved ones, let us not forget the families who have an empty seat at the table this year. And let us pledge that from now on, we will protect, defend, and save American lives.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2017-06-30", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

I want to thank the President of South Korea, President Moon, for being here. We had a great afternoon yesterday. We had fantastic dinner at the White House, accomplished a lot, having to do with our thoughts on North Korea and, very much, our thoughts on trade.\nWe are renegotiating a trade deal right now as we speak with South Korea, and hopefully, it will be an equitable deal, it will be a fair deal to both parties. It's been a rough deal for the United States, but I think that it will be much different and it will be good for both parties. So we're in the process of doing that.\nWe're also in the process of discussing our, frankly, many options—and we have many options—with respect to North Korea.\nThank you very much. President.\n[At this point, an interpreter spoke briefly to President Trump.]\nYes.\n[The interpreter translated President's Trump's remarks for President Moon, while many reporters asked questions and cameras clicked. President Trump then spoke as follows.]\nThe President will speak.\nPresident Moon. I would like to thank President Trump once again for inviting me to the White House and for his warm welcome. When I was inaugurated—when I won the election last month, President Trump was the first among all foreign leaders to call me to congratulate me. I believe that was to reconfirm the strength of the Korea-U.S. alliance and also President Trump's warm message to the Korean people who had been suffering through political turmoil.\nLast night, at the dinner with President Trump, we discussed various issues through a diverse scope and very honest discussions on issues to include the North Korean nuclear issue and other issues of mutual interest. It was a great opportunity for us to further our—the trust and friendship between me and President Trump. It was also an opportunity for us to reconfirm the fact that the United States and Korea are walking together on the same path towards a great alliance.\nSo I hope that through this summit meeting today, I hope that our relationship can further develop into a more meaningful and fruitful relationship.\nThank you very much.\nPresident Trump. What many people don't know is that South Korea is a major trading partner with the United States, and we want something that's going to be good for the American worker. And I think we'll be able to do that today, and I think we'll be able to do many other things. So the relationship is very, very strong, and our personal relationship with President Moon—our personal relationship is very, very good.\nThank you very much, everybody.

Pence; Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson; and Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126591", "text": "President Trump. Okay, thank you very much. We have many of our great members, our Vice President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense. We have our—some of our really wonderful leaders here. And you have your leaders with you and your representatives.\nAnd we're going to be discussing two things mostly, and number one would be North Korea, and we pretty much discussed that last night at length. I think we have a very, very strong, solid plan. And number two is going to be, of course, trade, because the trade deal is up, and we want to make a deal that's fair for the United States and fair for South Korea. So we'll start doing that.\nGary Cohn is here. Wilbur Ross is here. And I think that's a very important thing. And, Wilbur, perhaps you'd like to say a few things about trade right now, and we can probably leave the media—because trade is very important—for a little while. But perhaps you'd say a few words about trade and what we're looking to do.\nSecretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. Yes, sir. The trade imbalance with South Korea has doubled since the KORUS treaty was put into effect, and the largest single component of that is automotive trade. That's an absolute majority of it. There are a lot of nontariff trade barriers to U.S. exports. Only 25,000 cars per Big Three manufacturer are allowed in based on U.S. standards. Anything above that needs to be on Korean standards. So that kind of rulemaking affects quite a few industries and really restricts the access that U.S. companies have to the Korean market.\nWe have a separate problem with oilfield tubular goods and other steel products. There is no domestic market for oilfield tubular goods in Korea. So everything they make is for export, and we've had recent trade cases demonstrating that a lot of that is dumped Chinese steel coming as hot-rolled coil and then coming back to the U.S. as oilfield tubular goods.\nSo there are a lot of very specific problems, and I think the way to address it is to deal product by product with what we can do to change the export side and what we can do to reduce the bad import side.\nPresident Trump. All right, thank you very much. You can stay for this also. Perhaps Gary Cohn could say a few words also about trade.\nNational Economic Council Director Gary D. Cohn. Yes, thank you, Mr. President. As you know, much of our biggest problem on trade has to do with our economic relationship with China, and we have maintained a very large trade deficit with China, and it continues to grow.\nAs Wilbur said, China has many predatory practices involved—in the way they deal with us, with intellectual property and trade barriers for us. We're forced to transfer technology into China, forced to have joint ventures in China. We have tariffs and nontariff barriers; unable to own companies in China as well. And we're dealing with all of their policies.\nAt some point, we'd be interested to hear how you're dealing with the Chinese policies and how you can help us in dealing with Chinese policies. President Trump. Thank you very much. The fact is that the United States has trade deficits with many, many countries, and we cannot allow that to continue. And we'll start with South Korea right now. But we cannot allow that to continue. This is really a statement that I make about all trade. For many, many years, the United States has suffered through massive trade deficits. That's why we have $20 trillion in debt. So we'll be changing that.\nThe good news is, we make the great —products. And I appreciate very much, they're giving—South Korea is giving very, very big orders to the United States for, as you know, for military. They're buying many F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed; they're buying other military equipment at a level that they've never reached before. So that's good.\nAlso, I understand you're dealing with Alaska—great State—on natural gas and other parts of the United States. We have a lot of natural gas, so we love that you're going to do that.\nAnd things like that will bring down the trade deficit substantially. That's what we like, and we appreciate it very much.\nMr. President, would you like to say something before the media leaves?\n[At this point, President Moon spoke in Korean, and no translation was provided.]\nPresident Trump. Okay, we can do that. And I'm sure that everybody understood that answer. [Laughter] I hope. But it was a very good answer.\nThank you all very much.", "timestamp": "2017-06-30", "title": "Remarks During an Expanded Bilateral Meeting With President Moon Jae-in of South Korea"}

Trump", "note": "An original was not available for verification of the content of this joint statement.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126541", "text": "President Donald J. Trump hosted President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea (ROK) at the White House on June 29 and 30 in order to advance the comprehensive strategic Alliance between the United States and the ROK and to deepen the two countries' friendship. Since its founding, the Alliance has served as a linchpin for security, stability, and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula, in the Asia Pacific region, and increasingly around the world. As we mark the 67th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, the commitment of the United States to the ROK's defense remains ironclad. President Trump reaffirmed that the United States will defend the ROK against any attack and both presidents remain committed to jointly addressing the threat posed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Built on mutual trust and shared values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, the United States-ROK partnership has never been stronger, and the two leaders pledged to build an even greater Alliance going forward.\nStrengthening the United States-ROK Alliance\nThe two leaders affirmed the Alliance's fundamental mission to defend the ROK through a robust combined defense posture and the enhancement of mutual security based on the United States-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty. President Trump reiterated the United States commitment to provide extended deterrence to the ROK, drawing on the full range of United States military capabilities, both conventional and nuclear. Regular dialogue channels, such as the Security Consultative Meeting and the Military Committee Meeting, are instrumental in deepening our Alliance. The two leaders decided to continue the Alliance's work to expeditiously enable the conditions-based transfer of wartime operational control of ROK forces. The ROK will continue to acquire the critical military capabilities necessary to lead the combined defense, and detect, disrupt, destroy, and defend against the DPRK's nuclear and missile threats, including through interoperable Kill-Chain, Korean Air and Missile Defense (KAMD), and other Alliance systems.\nThe two leaders reaffirmed the Alliance's commitment to counter the growing threat to peace and security posed by the DPRK's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. To increase coordination on Alliance issues, the leaders committed the foreign affairs and defense agencies of the two countries to regularize a \"2+2\" ministerial meeting, as well as a high-level Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group to employ all elements of national power to strengthen extended deterrence.\nMaintaining Lock-Step Coordination on our Policy regarding the DPRK\nPresident Trump and President Moon pledged to continue to coordinate closely to achieve our shared goal of complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner. The two leaders called on the DPRK to refrain from provocative, destabilizing actions and rhetoric, and to make the strategic choice to fulfill its international obligations and commitments. The two leaders affirmed that the DPRK's nuclear tests and unprecedented number of ballistic missile tests constitute direct violations of multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) and highlight the accelerating threat the DPRK's missile programs pose to international peace and security. They affirmed their commitment to fully implement existing sanctions and impose new measures designed to apply maximum pressure on the DPRK and compel Pyongyang to cease its provocative actions and return to sincere and constructive talks. The two leaders also urged all UN member states to swiftly and fully implement UNSCR obligations and took note, with appreciation, of constructive actions by some countries around the world to exert diplomatic and economic pressure on the DPRK to return to credible negotiations on denuclearization. They noted the important role China could play to this end. In addition, the two sides committed to enhance cooperation to combat the DPRK's dangerous and destabilizing malicious cyber activity.\nNoting that sanctions are a tool of diplomacy, the two leaders emphasized that the door to dialogue with the DPRK remains open under the right circumstances. In reaffirming that resolution of the nuclear issue is a top priority for both countries, the two leaders emphasized that the United States and the ROK do not maintain a hostile policy toward the DPRK and, together with the rest of the international community, stand ready to work toward a brighter future for the DPRK, if it chooses the right path. The two sides will closely coordinate on a joint the DPRK policy, including efforts to create conditions necessary for denuclearization talks, through a high-level strategic consultation mechanism.\nPresident Trump supported the ROK's leading role in fostering an environment for peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula.\nThe two leaders expressed deep concern about the well-being of the DPRK's people, particularly in light of the egregious human rights violations and abuses committed against them by the government, and noted their intention to ensure sanctions have minimal impact on the DPRK's vulnerable populations. President Trump expressed support for President Moon's aspiration to restart inter-Korean dialogue on certain issues, including humanitarian affairs. The two leaders reaffirmed the importance of cooperating with the international community to hold the DPRK accountable for substantial progress on the deplorable human rights situation in that country.\nThe two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to promote regional relations and enhance United States-ROK-Japan trilateral cooperation. The two leaders affirmed that trilateral security and defense cooperation contributes to enhanced deterrence and defense against the DPRK threat. They decided to further develop this cooperation, using established bilateral and trilateral mechanisms. They also underscored the importance of leveraging the United States-ROK-Japan trilateral relationship to address global challenges such as cancer research, energy security, women's empowerment, and cybersecurity. President Trump and President Moon decided to discuss further ways to enhance trilateral cooperation together with Prime Minister Abe of Japan at the upcoming United States-ROK-Japan Trilateral Summit on the margins of the G20 in July.\nAdvancing Fair Trade to Promote Economic Growth\nPresident Trump and President Moon committed to foster expanded and balanced trade while creating reciprocal benefits and fair treatment between the two countries. In that regard, the two sides further committed to fostering a truly fair and level playing field, including working together to reduce the global overcapacity of such basic materials as steel and non-tariff barriers to trade. Both sides pledged to work together, as part of the process of the Commercial Dialogue, to promote investment, support entrepreneurs, and facilitate cooperation between the United States and the ROK to boost economic growth and job creation in both countries.\nEnhancing Bilateral Cooperation on Other Economic Opportunities\nBoth sides also committed to work together through the Senior Economic Dialogue to promote and expand cooperation on other economic issues and to explore the enhancement of economic opportunities through a joint public-private forum. Given the roles of science, technology, and innovation in driving economic growth, the two countries will enhance cooperation in cybersecurity, information and communication technology, and civil space technology. Highlighting the important economic role women play in their societies, the two sides pledged to launch a bilateral partnership to advance women's economic empowerment.\nActively Collaborating as Global Partners\nPresident Trump and President Moon affirmed that United States-ROK cooperation on global issues is an indispensable and expanding aspect of the Alliance. With respect to global health security collaboration, the two leaders affirmed their support in helping partner countries prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. The two leaders condemned the grave human suffering and violence in Iraq and Syria caused by ISIS, and reaffirmed the strong United States-ROK partnership in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. President Trump welcomed the ROK's commitment to increase humanitarian assistance to countries most affected by terrorism and violent extremism, including its pledge to provide 10 million United States dollars for Iraq this year. The two sides underscored the importance of joint efforts by the international community, including the United States and the ROK, to rebuild peace and stability in Afghanistan, and pledged to continue to work together to support the Afghan people and government.\nFuture of the Alliance\nThe two leaders shared the view that strong and dynamic ties between our two countries are the foundation of the United States-ROK Alliance. They decided to advance future-oriented cooperation through high-level consultations in the areas of economy and trade, renewable and nuclear energy, science and technology, space, environment, health, and defense technology. President Trump and President Moon affirmed that the United States and the ROK will work together to support and uphold the rules-based order in the Asia-Pacific region. The two leaders affirmed that the strength of the United States-ROK Alliance serves as testament to the power of freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, and acknowledged that the future of the two countries is linked through people-to-people ties, with more than 1.7 million Korean Americans in the United States, hundreds of thousands of Americans visiting and working in the ROK each year, and close ties created through cultural programs and student and professional exchanges. President Trump and President Moon heralded the exemplary nature of the United States-ROK Alliance, from strengthening our security by deterring and defending against the DPRK threat, enhancing strong regional relations, and advancing our economic relationship and expanding our global partnership. Both leaders expressed their expectation that the friendship and partnership between the two countries will continue to strengthen and grow for many decades to come.\nPresident Moon invited President Trump to visit the ROK in 2017; President Trump gladly accepted the invitation. The two leaders will continue to discuss issues of mutual interests on various occasions, including during international multilateral conferences.", "timestamp": "2017-06-30", "title": "Joint Statement by President Trump and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea"}

Thank you very much. You don't mind if I do that, right?\n[At this point, the President removed a binder from the podium and dropped it to the floor.]\nGet rid of that. [Laughter]\nThank you very much to our great Vice President and also for the fantastic job that Mike has been doing.\nThe future of American space leadership—we're going to lead again. It's been a long time. It's over 25 years, and we're opening up, and we are going to be leading again like we've never led before.\nWe're a nation of pioneers, and the next great American frontier is space. And we never completed—we started, but we never completed. We stopped. But now we start again. And we have tremendous spirit, and we're going to have tremendous spirit from the private sector, maybe in particular from the private sector.\nI'd like to extend a special welcome to an American hero who've I've known actually for a long time, Buzz Aldrin, who is with us today. Known him a long time. Thank you also to astronauts Benjamin Drew and David Wolf and former NASA Flight Director Gene Kranz for being with us and for working with us on exactly what we're doing today. Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\nWe're also joined by our great Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, who spent the morning negotiating trade deals with South Korea. And as you know, that trade deal is coming due, and it actually came due a couple of weeks ago. And I think we're going to make a good deal, right?\nSecretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. We've made some progress.\nThe President. I think so. That's what the word is. And good for both countries.\nAlso distinguished Members of Congress are with us and leaders of several of America's great aerospace companies.\nToday we're taking a crucial step to secure America's future in space by reviving the National Space Council after it was—has been dormant almost 25 years if you can believe it.\nDuring the campaign, Vice President Pence promised that our administration—because Mike's very much into space—would revive the National Space Council, and with this Executive order, we're keeping that promise. I feel very strongly about it. I've felt strongly about it for a long time. I used to say before doing what I did—I used to say, what happened? Why aren't we moving forward?\nToday's announcement sends a clear signal to the world that we are restoring America's proud legacy of leadership in space. Our Vice President cares very deeply about space policy and for good reason: Space exploration is not only essential to our character as a nation, but also our economy and our great nation's security.\nOur travels beyond the Earth propel scientific discoveries that improve our lives in countless ways here, right here, at home: powering vast new industry, spurring incredible new technology, and providing the space security we need to protect the American people. And security is going to be a very big factor with respect to space and space exploration. At some point in the future, we're going to look back and say how did we do it without space?\nThe Vice President will serve as the Council's chair. Several representatives of my administration will join him including the Secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce, Transportation, and Homeland Security; the Chairman of the great—I'll tell you, he's doing a fantastic job, always working, always fighting, and winning—winning big against ISIS, that I can tell you, seeing what's happening there—the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Adviser, NASA, and the Director of National Intelligence.\nThe Council will also draw the expertise of other White House offices as well as insights from scientists, innovators, and business leaders from across the country. We have many business leaders that want to be a big part of this. I think private—the privatization of certain aspects is going to be very—is going to play a very crucial role, don't you think? They are truly into it. This coordination will be accomplished through an Advisory Group that is being convened by today's Executive order, which I'll be signing in a minute.\nThe National Space Council will be a central hub guiding space policy within the administration. And I will draw on it for advice and information and recommendations for action. And the Vice President, myself, and a few others are going to pick some private people to be on the Board. I will say that's not easy because everybody wants to be on this Board. People that you wouldn't have believed loved what we're doing so much they want to—some of the most successful people in the world want to be on this Board.\nThe human soul yearns for discovery. By unlocking the mysteries of the universe, we unlock truths within ourselves. That's true. Our journey into space will not only make us stronger and more prosperous, but will unite us behind grand ambitions and bring us all closer together. Wouldn't that be nice? Can you believe that space is going to do that? I thought politics would do that. [Laughter] Well, we'll have to rely on space instead.\nEvery launch into the skies is another step forward toward a future where our differences seem small against the vast expanse of our common humanity. Sometimes, you have to view things from a distance in order to see the real truth. It is America's destiny to be at the forefront of humanity's eternal quest for knowledge and to be the leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown. And I could say the great and very beautiful unknown. Nothing more beautiful.\nWith the actions we are launching today, America will think big once again. Important words: think big. We haven't been thinking so big for a long time, but we're thinking big again as a country. We will inspire millions of children to carry on this proud tradition of American space leadership—and they're excited—and to never stop wondering, hoping, and dreaming about what lies beyond the stars.\nSo I just want to tell you that we are now going to sign an Executive order, and this is going to launch a whole new chapter for our great country. And people are very excited about it, and I can tell you, I'm very excited about it. Thank you all very much. All right. You know what this is: space. That's all it has to say is space. There's a lot of room out there, right?\nApollo 11 crewmember Edwin E. \"Buzz\" Aldrin, Jr. Infinity and beyond. [Laughter]\nThe President. This is infinity here. It could be infinity. We don't really don't know. But it could be. There's got to be something, but it could be infinity, right?\n[The President signed the Executive order.]\nOkay.
