SCHULTZ: Welcome aboard Air Force One, everybody, en route to Atlanta, where the President will address the 95th Convention of Disabled American Veterans. This will mark his final major address to our nation's veterans. So the President is looking forward to speaking with these brave men and women today.\nThe President will make two important announcements -- first, that since 2010, we have reduced veterans' homelessness by nearly half, and by 17 percent since just last year. And second, as part of the President's precision medicine initiative, 500,000 veterans have voluntarily donated their health data to the future of science and medicine through the VA's Million Veteran Program, marking a critical halfway point to the goal of signing up 1 million veterans.\nThe President will talk this afternoon about some of the veterans whose stories have deeply moved him over the past eight years. He'll also discuss the necessary transformation underway at the Veterans Administration, the progress we've made and the work still to be done.\nThis afternoon, the President will make the case that politicians and policymakers must do more than just pay lip service to caring for our veterans. He will point to some proposals in Washington that gut funding for veterans' care or to privatize the Veterans Administration. The President believes this is a misguided approach and that, as the greatest nation on Earth, we should not leave veterans to fend for themselves.\nSo I hope you all look forward to the President's remarks this afternoon. I'm happy to take questions on that or anything else on your minds.\nQ: -- that the President will touch upon politicians' rhetoric when it comes to our veterans. Gold Star families have been an important part of this administration and other presidencies, as well. Over the weekend, Donald Trump made some pretty offensive comments to the Khan family who spoke at the DNC. Is rhetoric like that appropriate in the Oval Office? And will President Obama specifically mention those comments in his remarks today?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Stacey, thank you for the question. I don't have any additional preview of the President's remarks beyond what I was just able to discuss. For any response on the campaign trail I'd refer you to -- for any response to back-and-forth on the campaign trail, I would refer you to the campaigns.\nI can say, generally speaking, since you mentioned the President's longstanding support for Gold Star families, I'm happy to tell you about our approach. As you mentioned, this is something that the President believes should rise above politics; that the sacred covenant we have with the brave men and women who serve our country and those who perform the ultimate sacrifice should be one that we honor every single day. The President believes that nobody has given more for our country's security, for our country's safety, for our country's freedom than Gold Star families.\nThis is something, as you point out, he's expressed in public, but it's also something he's expressed in private when meeting with families, when grieving with families. You'll note that just last week, Sharon Belkofer introduced the President at the Democratic National Convention. She, herself, is a Gold Star mom who lost her son in a Taliban attack in Afghanistan a few years ago. The President was deeply moved by her introduction and took enormous pride in her remarks that evening. So the President believes that Sharon's family and families all across this country who've made the ultimate sacrifice deserve nothing but honor and gratitude for their sacrifice.\nThe President has expressed that before. But in terms of what his remarks will say today, I'd encourage you to tune in.\nQ: Separate from the ongoing campaign and any specific person who may or may not have said anything, would President Obama, as he is leaving office, support or stand by these types of comments being made by someone who could take his place next year?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, I do believe the President's views on this are well-known, which is families who made the ultimate sacrifice for this country's freedom and this country's safety deserve nothing but our country's honor and gratitude and deepest respect.\nQ: How do you respond, or how does the administration respond to critics who say that the problems at the VA got worse, not better, during the President's first term, and that the efforts that he's making now essentially amount to tinkering around the edges and not the complete overhaul that they say the place requires, including more privatization, seeing private doctors, et cetera?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Mike, I'm glad you asked that question, because this President has made it a priority to transform the Veterans Administration. That began many years ago, and an important milestone for that was bringing in Secretary Bob McDonald, who has an esteemed record in the private sector in terms of making sure organizations and businesses and large bureaucracies run better. That was the mandate given to Secretary McDonald when he took the oath of office to run the Veterans Administration. That's something the Secretary has made enormous progress on.\nBut if you're suggesting that there's more work to be done, the answer to that is absolutely. But I do reject the notion that we're just tinkering around the edges. To the contrary. At the President's direction, Secretary McDonald has initiated a transformation at the VA that begins with how they deploy their care and services, but also includes how they track service and care, how they hold themselves accountable, how they protect whistleblowers instead of shunning them.\nSo the President and Secretary McDonald have both been very clear, they want as much transparency and accountability at the VA as possible. Again, we've made remarkable success. The idea that we could cut veterans' homelessness in half was an idea I think many people would say is far-fetched. This has been a problem in this country for decades, what some called intractable years ago. The President is proud of the progress we've made on that.\nBut like you said, we're not done. We've got a lot of work to go. I think the President is going to speak to this exact challenge this afternoon.\nQ: Can you confirm, as the Libyan government announced today, that the U.S. has begun airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Libya?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Darlene, I think the Department of Defense -- we might have lifted off by this point -- but the Department of Defense did confirm that at the request of the Libyan Government Of National Accord, the U.S. military conducted precision airstrikes against ISIL targets in Sert, Libya to support the GNA-affiliated forces seeking to defeat ISIL in its primary stronghold inside Libya.\nI can tell you that these strikes were authorized by the President at the recommendation of Defense Secretary Carter and is consistent with our overall approach of combatting ISIL, which is principally to work with capable and motivated local forces.\nWe've seen GNA-affiliated forces on the ground in Libya recapture territory from ISIL recently, and these strikes were intended to help support those forces as they continue to make progress.\nBroadly speaking, these strikes are consistent with our overall approach -- as you've seen, we've had significant impact on going after ISIL in Iraq and Syria. I believe the latest statistics from the Department of Defense include that we've recaptured -- the coalition forces have recaptured about 50 percent of ISIL's territory in Iraq and about 25 percent of ISIL's territory in Syria. But we've always been clear that the threat posed by ISIL extends beyond those two countries. The President has been clear that he will deny any safe haven to groups like ISIL or terrorists who wish to do us harm, and that's why the strikes you've seen are consistent with that approach.\nQ: Are the strikes sort of a one-and-done kind of thing or will there be more?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I don't want to preview any additional military action for you, but these types of precision strikes were approved by the President earlier at the request of the Defense Secretary. I will say that U.S. assistance will be limited to strikes and information sharing. There are unique capabilities that our military can provide to support forces on the ground, and that's what the President wanted to do.\nQ: Governor Scott said that the number of Zika cases has risen to 14 in Florida. Stipulating that, of course, you want Congress to do more -- we don't need to hear that whole thing again -- but he'd asked specifically for a federal emergency response team and so I'm wondering if you could respond to the Governor's request.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you, Justin. The President is, as we mentioned on Friday, continually getting briefed on the situation in south Florida. I know that Governor Scott made that request, and we are -- that team is being deployed by the CDC in short order so we'll be able to work with Governor Scott's team on the ground in south Florida.\nLike you said -- or like we've talked about recently, the Governor has said they're working this aggressively. They are redoubling their vector control in the area. They're testing both mosquitoes and people. And they're closely monitoring and committed to making adjustments to their protocol as necessary.\nThey're doing all of this with the support of the CDC at the federal level. As we've said, we've deployed -- the CDC has given out $2 million in specific Zika response funding, and also $27 million in emergency preparedness funding, much of which can be used for their response to this. This disbursement of funds is on top of other pieces that have been mobilized in the federal government to respond. The Department of Health and Human Services, they are assisting local governments all across the country on vector control. They continue to expand their efforts on research and vaccine development.\nUnfortunately, as we've seen, vaccine development is one of the areas that has been slowed because Congress has not funded this response. Unfortunately, Congress left town for about seven weeks without doing anything. Congress left town about four months after the United States -- the Obama administration submitted a request for $1.9 billion worth of funding. That wasn't a number that we pulled out of thin air. That was a number that was developed based on our public health professionals and our experts telling us what the United States government would need to fully fund a response to this effort.\nSo if anything, we hope that this provides a wake-up call to members of Congress that when they get back to Washington from their vacation, they can get to work on addressing this problem.\nQ: There was a Russian military helicopter that was shot down in Syria. I'm wondering if you can confirm whether or not it was working on a humanitarian mission. What impact do you think it will have on the peace talks and whether or not it will impact the sort of safe corridors that they're trying to set up for humanitarian access?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin, I saw public reports on this. I know that Russian officials have spoken to it. I don't think we'll have too much to add from here other than to express regret for any loss of life in association with this conflict. That's, frankly, why we've been working tirelessly on a political solution. We believe that there is no military solution to this crisis. That's why Secretary Kerry has been our principal diplomat, working with his counterpart in Russia, Foreign Minister Lavrov, in order to make some progress on the political solution inside Syria.\nQ: Russian officials said today that basically -- that the accusations that they were involved in the hacking of the DNC or the DCC are basically just a cover or a way to distract from the fact that there's actually been domestic tampering with the campaign, and basically accusing, I guess, the U.S. of trying to use them as a scapegoat. I was wondering, did you have any response to that? And then also, if the Russians or if a state actor is involved in these hacks -- I know you kind of dealt with this before -- but what is the administration considering as a way to respond? What is the appropriate response to these types of hacks if they're being carried out by other state actors?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ayesha, I'll address a couple points there. First, the FBI is still investigating this matter, so it's important that I not get ahead of that investigation. So we're going to wait for that investigation to conclude. They will also make a determination if it's appropriate to publicly implicate the culprit. That's a decision that will be made by the FBI and our national security officials to determine if that's in the U.S.'s best interest, to make that public declaration.\nI would refer you to the Director of National Intelligence -- James Clapper actually spoke to this late last week. He said that there's \"a host of usual suspects out there that engage in this sort of activity.\" But the FBI is still investigating, and if there's a point where they determine who was responsible for this attack and that it's in the United States' best interest to make that conclusion public, that they'll be the first to do so.\nSo I don't have any updates on the investigation for you. We do know -- and the President has spoken to this -- that Russia has a record of engaging in this activity. You don't have to take my word for that. That's something that's been expressed by our national security officials for many years now. That's something we've been tracking for a while. Admiral Mike Rogers of Cyber Command, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services back in April -- that was before this latest back-and-forth -- he said that \"Russia has very capable cyber operators who can and do work with speed, precision and stealth. Russia is also home to a substantial segment of the world's most sophisticated cybercriminals who have found victims all over the world.\"\nSo as we've also mentioned, Secretary Kerry raised this in a meeting with Prime Minister Lavrov, I think two weeks ago now. That's again because, unfortunately, Russia has a bad record when it comes to this type of activity. But I don't have any actions to preview for you that would come after the FBI makes a conclusion on its investigation.\nQ: Will there be consideration of bringing a criminal case or doing -- I mean, or some type of retaliation or, I guess, sanctions?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, I want to be very clear, I cannot get ahead of the FBI investigation into this specific matter. I can say, generally speaking, if you look at how the United States has responded to intrusions by state actors into cyber infrastructure within the United States, there's a whole host of options available to us. That includes economic sanctions that would be housed at the Department of Treasury, and that does include law enforcement measures that could be taken out of the Department of Justice.\nQ: I have just one other one on veterans. In 2010, when the President announced -- he said that he wanted to eliminate veterans' homelessness by 2015. And today, he is going to say that it's been cut almost in half. Can you speak a little bit to why we're not at zero, as he intended or wanted?\nMR. SCHULTZ: That's a totally fair question and this is a goal that's extraordinarily important to the President. And when he set that goal, he knew it was ambitious and he knew it was a daunting task. It was a problem that has escaped administrations of both parties for many decades. Quite frankly, it's a problem that has been elusive to governors and mayors across the board for many years. But that didn't deter the President from wanting to make this a priority.\nSo we're proud of the progress that we've made over the last few years. Like I said, we've now cut that number in half. We've actually cut it by 17 percent in just the last 12 months. So the President is proud of the progress we've made. But you are absolutely correct to point out that there's still work to be done. And I expect the President to address this head on this afternoon in Atlanta.\nQ: There are hundreds more that were either arrested or dismissed from their jobs in Turkey over the weekend. At what point does your guys' refusal to explicitly condemn this turn into condoning it in some way?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Justin, I want to be very clear. We have unequivocally condemned the failed coup in Turkey.\nQ: -- that's not what I'm asking.\nMR. SCHULTZ: We fully support the democratically elected government in Turkey. The President has conveyed that privately and we've expressed that publicly. What we've also said publicly is that we believe that Turkey must respect its democratic institutions; that freedom of the press, freedom to protest, freedom of speech are enshrined in the Turkish constitution and, quite frankly, that's just not in the United States' best interest, that's in the best interest of the people of Turkey -- that when we respect democratic institutions, that strengthens society as a whole.\nSo the President hasn't wavered on that at all. The President believes that the country of Turkey was shook by a failed coup by its military leadership, and so it's going to take some time to work through that. But as they do, the President has been crystal-clear that they should do so in a way that also respects civil liberties and the strong traditions of democratic institutions.\nQ: So you would say that President Erdogan's actions have sort of surpassed those strong institutions or gone contrary to democratic values?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I would say the Turkish government understands the U.S. position, which is, in order to move past this challenging time, they have to do so recognizing that one of their strengths as a country is their respect for democratic institutions. That includes freedom of the press, freedom to gather, freedom of speech, freedom of expression. And the only way to honor the Turkish constitution is to respect those principles.\nThank you, guys.\nEND 12:31 P.M.

Thank you, DAV! Thank you so much. Thank you. Please, everybody, have a seat. What an honor to be with you today. Thank you. And thanks to Bobby. I'll never forget the time Bobby came to the Oval Office carrying a baseball bat. [Laughter] Secret Service got a little nervous. [Laughter] But it was a genuine Louisville Slugger, a thank-you for going to bat for our veterans. And I want to thank Bobby for your devotion to our veterans, especially your fellow Vietnam vets. Thank you. Give Bobby a big round of applause.\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. I love you back. I do!\nI want to thank our outstanding leadership team for welcoming me today, including National Commander Moses McIntosh, Senior Vice Commander Dave Riley, National Adjutant Marc Burgess, Executive Director Barry Jesinoski. Your voice in Washington, Garry Augustine. And don't forget Pat Kemper and all the spouses and families of the DAV Auxiliary. Thank you.\nI also want to acknowledge Mayor Kasim Reed and County Chairman John Eaves for welcoming us to the great State of Georgia and the beautiful city of Atlanta. I am pleased to be joined by our tireless Secretary of the VA, Bob McDonald. I know he spoke to you yesterday. He is working hard—hard—every single day to transform the VA to serve our veterans better. He still gives out his cell phone number and his e-mail. Not many people know this, but so far, he's received more than 45,000 calls, e-mails, and texts. [Laughter] And I don't know what his phone bill is looking like. [Laughter] I hope he has a good plan. [Laughter] But Bob and his team work to deal with each one of those texts or e-mails or phone calls he receives because every single veteran matters. And he knows that. So thank you, Bob, for the great work you're doing.\nSo it's good to be back with the Disabled American Veterans. And what a journey that we've had together.\nAudience member. We're glad to have you!\nThe President. It's great to be here.\nWe worked together back when I was a Senator. You were one of the first veterans' organizations I called when I ran for President. I welcomed you to the White House as a partner. I came to your convention in my first term, and my second, along with Michelle. And so it is fitting that my final major address to our Nation's veterans as President is here at the DAV.\nAnd as I reflect on these past 8 years, some of the most unforgettable experiences that I've had have been moments I've spent with you—Americans, veterans, and your families. We stood together at Arlington to honor Corporal Frank Buckles, 110 years old, our last veteran from the First World War, as he was laid to rest. I ordered our flags to be flown at halfstaff because, even after a hundred years, we will never stop saluting those who served in our name. We stood together at Normandy to thank an entire generation—among them, my grandfather, who was in Patton's army—a generation that literally saved the world. There was Harry Kulkowitz, who returned to the beaches he helped liberate and, told he could have anything he wanted, said with the humility of a soldier, a hamburger will do just fine. [Laughter] I think of Luta McGrath. This past Veterans Day, just before her 108th birthday, then the oldest known female veteran of World War II, which was a reminder that women have always served to keep America strong and free.\nWe've stood together at the memorial to our Korean war veterans and recalled how a soldier, marching through the snow, had a tiny pair of baby booties hanging from his rifle—a reminder of his unborn child—a story that had been lost to history. But we tracked him down. We found him. And we shared the story of Korean war veteran Dick Shank, who made it home to that baby boy and lived out his life—at 84 years old, he was still roller skating—[laughter]—because no war should ever be forgotten and no veteran should ever be overlooked.\nWe've stood together at the wall and remembered the lessons of Vietnam: that even when Americans may disagree about a war, we have to stand united in support of our troops; and that for mothers like Sarah Shay, who honored her missing son for more than 40 years, we will never stop working to bring home our prisoners of war and our missing in action. We leave nobody behind. No one.\nAnd we've come together to welcome our newest veterans into your ranks, from Desert Storm, the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq—our proud 9/11 generation. This is a time of transition. When I came into office, we had nearly 180,000 American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. Today, that number is less than 15,000. Most of our troops have come home.\nTo all of you who served in Afghanistan, you can take enormous pride in the progress you helped achieve: driving Al Qaida out of its camps, toppling the Taliban, delivering justice to Usama bin Laden, helping Afghans improve their lives. There are millions of boys and girls in school, and democratic elections and a democratic government. Training Afghan forces to take responsibility for their own security, so that we are no longer engaged in a major ground war in Afghanistan. That is your legacy. And today we salute our forces serving there on a more limited mission—supporting Afghan forces, going after terrorists—because we must never allow Afghanistan to be used as a safe haven for terrorists to attack our Nation again.\nTo all of you who served in Iraq, we saw your heroism in pushing out a dictator whose brutality must be condemned, never praised; in defeating an insurgency; in giving the Iraqi people a chance. And no matter what has happened since, your valor in the deserts, in fierce urban combat, will be honored in the annals of military history.\nLet me say something else about this generation. As Commander in Chief, I'm pretty tired of some folks trash-talking America's military and troops. Our military is somewhat smaller. After two major ground wars come to a close, that's natural. And we're going to keep doing everything we need to do to improve readiness and modernize our forces. But let's get some facts straight. America's Army is the best trained, best equipped land force on the planet. Our Navy is the largest and most lethal in the world. The precision of, and reach of, our Air Force is unmatched. Our Marines are the world's only truly expeditionary force. We have the world's finest Coast Guard. We have the most capable fighting force in history, and we're going to keep it that way. And no ally or adversary should ever doubt our strength and our resolve. And we will keep pounding ISIL and taking out their leaders and pushing them back on the ground. And united with a global coalition, we will destroy this barbaric terrorist group. They will be destroyed.\nIn the face of Russian aggression, we're not going to turn our back to our allies in Europe. We're going to stay united in NATO, which is the world's strongest alliance. From the Asia-Pacific to Africa to the Americas, the United States and our Armed Forces will remain the greatest force for freedom and security and peace that the world has ever known. That is your legacy. That is what we have to protect, and that is what we have to defend.\nAnd let me say this: No one—no one—has given more for our freedom and our security than our Gold Star families. Michelle and I have spent countless hours with them. We have grieved with them. There's a reason why, last week in Philadelphia, I was humbled to be introduced by Sharon Belkofer from Ohio, a Gold Star mom whose son Tom, a lieutenant colonel in the Army, gave his life in Afghanistan. I requested Sharon to introduce me, because I understood that our Gold Star families have made a sacrifice that most of us cannot even begin to imagine. They represent the very best of our country. They continue to inspire us every day, every moment. They serve as a powerful reminder of the true strength of America. And we have to do everything we can for those families, and honor them, and be humbled by them.\nDAV, I know that your service has also been defined by another battle. This is a group that understands sacrifice. You've been defined by the battle here at home to persevere through wounds and disabilities. I think of a veteran from Iraq who lost her arm, but who said she decided to focus \"not on what I had lost, but on what I still had.\" I see that same spirit in you. Maybe it was there in the hospital bed, fighting for your life, you learned what it really means to have faith. Maybe it was during rehab, learning without—how to live without a leg—or both—you learned what it really means to persevere.\nAbout a month ago, I went to Walter Reed—I do this periodically—and was in the rehab unit watching some of these folks work out. And I decided—you might have seen this—I was doing some pushups with them and—[laughter]—trying to keep up with them. And I was sweating and getting all tired. [Laughter] They took it easy on me. [Laughter] But it gave me a sense of—just a small sense of what perseverance really means.\nMaybe it was during the night when the memories came rushing back, and you summoned the courage to reach out and get help and stay strong. And I was proud to help recognize your patriotism and resilience in the heart of our Nation's Capital when we dedicated the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial.\nThis organization shows us, shows this Nation, what it means to be strong. But as strong as you are—and nobody is stronger than our disabled vets—I know you didn't make this journey alone. You're here because of the love and support of your families and your caregivers and your neighbors and your communities and your fellow veterans. They were the shoulder you leaned on, who carried you when you couldn't walk, who picked you up when you stumbled, who celebrated your victories with you, who sometimes just made you laugh and reminded you how good life can be.\nAnd that brings me to what I want to talk about here today. For more than two centuries, this country that we love hasn't just endured; we have thrived. We have overcome challenges that would have broken a lesser nation. And not thanks to any one person or one group of people, but because, like you learned in the military, we're all one team. We believe in taking care of each other and in lifting each other up and leaving no one behind——\nAudience member. That's right!\nThe President. ——and in meeting the collective responsibilities that we can only meet together: the security of our Nation; the education of our children; dignity for our seniors; equal rights for all of our citizens; health care, which is now a right for everybody; and the care and well-being of our veterans and your families. That is a responsibility for all of us, not just a few. We all have to do our part.\nAnd as I've said before, America's commitment to our veterans is not just lines in a budget. And it can't be about politics. It's not even really about policy. Our commitment to our veterans is a sacred covenant. And I don't use those words lightly. It is sacred because there is no more solemn request than to ask someone to risk their life, to be ready to give their life on our behalf. It's a covenant because both sides have responsibilities. Those who put on the uniform, you took an oath to protect and defend us. While the rest of us, the citizens you kept safe, we pledged to take care of you and your families when you come home. That's a sacred covenant. That's a solemn promise that we make to each other. And it is binding. And upholding it is a moral imperative.\nAnd at times, our Nation has not always upheld this covenant. Our Vietnam vets, they sure know this.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. When you came home, you deserved better. Veterans who at times have struggled to get care at the VA, you deserve better too. If there's ever a breach in the covenant, then leaders in this country have to work hard to regain trust.\nThat's what Bob and so many hard-working people at the VA are doing. But upholding this covenant has to be the work of all of us. It's not just the VA's job. It's everybody's job. Government has to deliver the care and benefits and support that you have earned. Veterans service organizations have to hold us accountable and be our partners, like the 1.3 million members of the DAV are doing every day. And citizens have to step up too, which is why Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden, through Joining Forces, have rallied the American people to honor and support our military families and our veterans.\nNow, we've got a lot more work to do. But working together over these past 8 years, we've delivered real progress for our veterans. And we can't let up. It's not a reason for complacency, but we should understand that when we really put our sweat and tears and put our shoulder to the wheel, we can make things better.\nAbout 200,000 servicemembers are becoming veterans every single year. And America is going to have to be there for you for a lifetime in five important ways.\nNumber one, we have to keep fighting for the resources you need. Now, since I took office, we've made historic increases in veterans funding, the biggest boost in decades. That's a fact. And I've proposed another increase for next year. So all together, during my Presidency, we will have increased funding for veterans by more than 85 percent.\nWith advance appropriations, we're protecting veterans' health care from the annual Washington budget battles. But I do have to point this out: Republicans in Congress have proposed cutting my VA budget. And when they return in the fall, they should pass the budget our veterans need and fund it fully. Don't just talk about standing with veterans. Don't just talk about me. [Laughter] Do something to support our veterans. That's what you need to do.\nNumber two, we've got to keep fighting to deliver the health care you've been promised. Today, more of our Vietnam vets are getting your disability benefits because of your exposure to agent orange. That's a change that we made. So, too, for our Desert Storm veterans, because the illnesses tied to the Gulf war. Those are changes we made. All together, we've made VA benefits available to more than 2 million veterans who didn't have them before.\nSometimes—[applause]. Let's face it, sometimes folks don't know that, but it's a fact. And I have to say, thanks to the Affordable Care Act——\nAudience member. Thank you!\nThe President. ——Obamacare—veterans not covered by the VA now have access to quality, affordable health care. And insurance companies can't discriminate against you because of preexisting conditions like posttraumatic stress. And more veterans are gaining access to health insurance.\nSo we need to keep making it easier to access care. That's why we recruited some of the best talent from Silicon Valley and the private sector. And in one of their very first innovations, veterans can now finally apply for VA health care anytime, anywhere, from any device, including your smartphone—simple, easy, in as little as 20 minutes. Just go to vets.gov. The days of having to wait in line at a VA office or mailing it in—those days are over. We're finally moving into the 21st century when it comes to helping our veterans. It's about time.\nWe're reaching more veterans, including rural veterans, with telemedicine, so you can see someone at the VA without leaving your home. We now have a designated women's health provider at all VA clinics to make sure our women's veterans get the tailored care and the dignity and the respect that you deserve.\nAnd for our disabled vets, we have increased funds for prosthetics, eliminated copays if you're catastrophically disabled, made progress on concurrent receipt so more severely disabled retirees can now receive your military retired pay and your VA disability benefits. And we're doing more than ever to make sure your devoted families and caregivers get the skills and support they need to stay strong as well.\nAnd here, I want to thank veterans across our country for being part of another mission: our Precision Medicine Initiative to revolutionize health care with treatments that are tailored for each patient. As of today, more than 500,000 veterans—maybe some of you—have stepped forward and donated your health and genetic data for research, which brings us halfway to our goal of 1 million veterans that are doing so.\nAnd what this does is it gives us a better understanding of genetics, which will allow us to improve treatments for things like traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic stress and diabetes and cancer. And that won't just help veterans. It will help all Americans. And it's just one more example of how our veterans keep serving our country even after they've come home.\nWe need to keep improving mental health care. I'll never forget the soldiers I met at Fort Bliss. They were proud of their service, but they were struggling with issues like posttraumatic stress. So for veterans with PTS, we made it easier for you to qualify for the VA care that you need, no matter when you served. We've increased funding for veterans' mental health care by more than 75 percent—billions more dollars. More awareness and outreach, because we have to end any shame or stigma that comes with going and getting help. We've put in place more clinicians, more counselors, more peer support—veterans helping veterans. More research: $100 million for new approaches to PTS and TBI. And today, we're delivering more mental health care to more veterans than ever. We are saving lives.\nBut when too many veterans still aren't getting the care that they need, we all have to be outraged. We all have to do better. And when 20 veterans a day are taking their own lives, that is a national tragedy. We all have to do better. Most of those 20 vets taking their lives each day are not in the VA. But we know that when vets do get VA care, they're more likely to survive. So we need to get more vets connected to the VA. And when you have an urgent need for mental health care, you shouldn't have to wait days, you shouldn't have to wait weeks. You should get those services the very same day.\nAnd Congress can help by providing the funding and flexibility we need to hire highly qualified mental health professionals. And medical schools can help us recruit and train more psychiatrists. And every American, military and civilian, can help as well, by learning those five signs that somebody is hurting, so we can reach out and help our veterans stay strong. We're one team, one American family. When any member of our family is suffering, we've got to be there for each other.\nNow, we also need to keep fixing the problems that came to light: long wait times, veterans denied care, people manipulating the books—inexcusable. I know Bob gave you an update, but I want to repeat: We've hired thousands more doctors, nurses, staff; opened more clinical space. And, with the Choice Program, we're helping more veterans get care outside of the VA. It all adds up to millions more appointments, delivering more benefits to more veterans than ever before. That is progress.\nBut even as we improve access, more veterans than ever are seeking care. So we're putting more and more resources in, but you've got more and more demand for care at the same time. And this surge in demand means there are now more veterans waiting for appointments, even though we've done a lot more. So I know I'm not satisfied. Bob is still not satisfied. And we will not let up. Bob and his new leadership team are going to keep pushing to transform the VA, and he will keep holding people accountable. This is somebody who cares deeply about our veterans getting what they deserve and what they have earned.\nAnd when whistleblowers expose misconduct, they will need to be protected, not punished. We need Congress to make it easier for the VA to help veterans get care in your communities.\nBut I have to say—here's one thing I want to be very clear about—here's one thing we will not do: We cannot outsource and privatize health care for America's veterans. There are folks who keep pushing this. They don't always come out and say the word \"privatize,\" but that—you read what they say, that's what they mean. And these radical proposals would begin to dismantle the VA health care system that millions of veterans depend on every day. And that would hurt veterans.\nStudy after study shows that in many areas, like mental health, the quality of care at the VA is often better than in private care. So let's listen to our veterans, who are telling us: Don't destroy VA health care. Fix it and make it work, but don't break our covenant with our veterans.\nThis brings me to the third area where we have to stay focused. We have to keep cutting the disability claims backlog. Now, from its peak, we've slashed that backlog by nearly 90 percent. My Chief of Staff and I—there were—there was a chunk of time when that backlog was high where, every day, no matter what else was happening around the world, he and I, we'd take these walks around the South Lawn just to keep our exercise, keep our steps up. And every day, we talked about, how are we going to get that backlog down. And each week, we'd look and see what kind of progress we're making. That's how we reduced it by 90 percent.\nThe backlog is now lower than when I came into office, even though there are a lot more people who are eligible for claims. And claims decisions are more accurate the first time.\nAnd on both these fronts, we're keeping at it. But as we all know, when veterans appeal a decision, you're put into an appeals system that right now is broken. And you shouldn't have to fight for years to get a straight answer. Now, we've proposed major reforms, and I want to thank the DAV and all the other veterans' groups for raising your voice on this. We've got to keep up the pressure. Congress needs to pass comprehensive reform of the claims appeals process, because if we don't fix the appeals process, even when we get the backlog down on the original claim, too many folks are waiting on the back end. We've got to fix it. And we can. But we're going to have to push Congress. And I don't know if you've noticed, that's hard. [Laughter]\nFourth, we've got to keep fighting for the dignity of every veteran. And that includes ending the tragedy, the travesty of veterans' homelessness. Now, this is something that, within my administration, we've said this is all hands on deck, across government. Everybody has got to be involved in this. And with Joining Forces, Michelle and Jill have helped galvanize hundreds of mayors and communities across the country. Two States, Virginia and Connecticut, as well as 27 cities and towns across the country have effectively ended veterans' homelessness.\nSo today I can announce that, nationally, we have now reduced the number of homeless veterans by 47 percent—nearly half. We have just about cut veterans' homelessness in half. We've helped bring tens of thousands of veterans off the streets. But we're not slowing down. We're going to keep up the momentum. This fall, Michelle will bring our partners from across the country together at the White House to share best practices to figure out what has worked, what hasn't worked. Because we will not stop until every veteran who fought for America has a home in America. This is something we've got to get done.\nAnd finally, we've got to keep fighting to give our troops and veterans and your families every opportunity to live the American Dream that you helped defend. With our overhaul of the transition assistance program, hundreds of thousands of departing servicemembers and their spouses have received training to plan their next career and find a job or start a business. We expanded the post-9/11 GI bill to reservists and National Guard members and families, including Gold Star spouses and children. And then we expanded it to vocational training and apprenticeships.\nWe've empowered veterans with new tools to find the schools that are right for you or to get the support you need to succeed on campus, to make sure you don't get ripped off, to cap your student loans, to make sure you and your families get instate tuition, which is true now in all 50 States. And so far, we have helped more than 1.6 million veterans and their families realize their dream of an education, an investment in you and America that will keep us strong and keep paying off for generations to come.\nSo we're doing more to help you find jobs worthy of your incredible talents. Because if you could lead a team and run logistics and manage a budget or save a life in a war zone, you sure as heck can do it right back here at home. I called for States to recognize the training and skills of veterans when issuing credentials for civilian jobs, licensing. Now all 50 States do it. Before, less than half the States made it easy for military spouses to get credentials and licenses. Today, all 50 States do it. Starting this fall, we'll close loopholes to protect our troops and military families from predatory payday lenders.\nSo today, all across America, more veterans are at work, on the job, beginning the next chapter of your service to our country. Veterans who are physicians and nurses have been hired by community health centers. Cities and towns are hiring veterans as teachers and police officers, firefighters and first responders. Because we made it a priority in the Federal Government, hiring hundreds of thousands of veterans, including disabled veterans, nearly one in three Federal workers is now a veteran.\nI challenged America's companies to hire veterans. And then, in case they weren't listening to me, I've sicced Jill and Michelle on them—[laughter]—through Joining Forces, and companies now have hired or trained more than 1.2 million veterans and military spouses. So, all told, we've cut veterans' unemployment by more than half, down to 4.2 percent, which is actually lower than the already low national average. And it's way down for post-9/11 veterans too. It's one of the reasons we've been able to help more than 3.6 million veterans buy or refinance a home of their own.\nSo I'm going to keep saying to every company in America, if you want talent, if you want dedication, if you want to get the job done, then hire a vet! Hire a military spouse! They know how to get the job done. They don't fool around!\nSo, DAV, we've made a lot of progress. It's not always focused on, because, understandably, the news a lot of the time focuses on what's still not working. That's okay. That keeps us on our toes, keeps us working. But every once in a while, it's good to remember the progress we've made, because that tells us when we focus on it, we can do right by our veterans. And as this new generation of veterans joins your ranks, we've got to keep on stepping up our game, giving veterans the resources you need, transforming the VA, delivering the health care you've earned, reducing the backlog, reforming appeals, standing up for your dignity, and helping you share in the American Dream.\nAnd I know we can, because over the past 8 years, I've seen the spirit of America, and I have seen time and time and time again the strength of our veterans, the unbreakable will of our disabled vets. You teach us better than anybody that we may take a hit sometimes, we may get knocked down, but we get back up. We carry on. And when we take care of each other and uphold that sacred covenant, there is nothing we cannot do.\nLike that soldier I've told you before, Army Ranger veteran Cory Remsburg, nearly killed in Afghanistan, who learned to talk again and walk again, and who recently stood up and walked into the Oval Office and shook my hand. We all have to keep on rising.\nLike Medal of Honor recipient Staff Sergeant Ty Carter, who struggled with posttraumatic stress, and who's now helping others stay strong. Troops, veterans, civilians—we all have to keep on healing.\nLike the wounded warriors and disabled vets who are out there running and jumping and swimming and biking and climbing, including Marine Corps veteran Charlie Linville, who just became the first combat amputee to reach the top of Mount Everest. We all have to keep on striving. Like the veterans taking care of each other, including here at the DAV: Army veteran Oscar Olguin; Navy Reserve veteran Charity Edgar; Marine Corps veteran Carmen McGinnis, who says helping veterans \"gives me a sense of purpose.\" That's something we all have to recognize. We all have to keep on serving.\nLike Air Force Technical Sergeant Jason Miller, who considered taking his own life, but who wrote me a letter, and after I put him in touch with Team Rubicon, went to work rebuilding communities after disasters, found a new purpose in life. Well, we all have to keep building this country we love.\nAnd like the ranks of our military and our veterans—whether they are Black or White or Latino or Asian or Native American, or they are young or old, whether they are gay or straight, whatever their faith, men, women, Americans with disabilities—we have to keep on uniting as one team, as one people, as one Nation.\nThat's what you have taught us. That's what you are an example of. The Disabled Veterans of America knows what it means to be one team. We draw inspiration from you. I am grateful for everything that you have done for this country. I am grateful for having had the opportunity to work with you.\nGod bless you. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your sacrifice. Thank you for your patriotism. We honor and appreciate you. God bless our veterans, and God bless the United States of America.\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-08-01", "title": "Remarks to the Disabled American Veterans National Convention in Atlanta, Georgia"}

Good morning, everybody.\nAudience members. Good morning!\nPresident Obama. Today we welcome our friends from Singapore. We have a little——\nAudience members. Woo!\nThe President. ——we have some Singapore weather. [Laughter] So you can appreciate that. Singapore is one nation, with four official languages. So let me just say good morning. Selamat datang. Vanakkam. And ni hao. On behalf of Michelle and myself, on behalf of the American people, I am honored to welcome Prime Minister Lee and Mrs. Lee to the United States.\nThis marks the first official state visit by a Singaporean Prime Minister in over 30 years. It celebrates the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two nations. And it is a reflection of my friendship and partnership with Prime Minister Lee over the past 8 years. It's an opportunity for me to repay the hospitality that the Prime Minister and the people of Singapore showed me when I visited Singapore during my first year in office. We were there for the APEC summit, with its tradition of dressing in shirts that are somewhat colorful—[laughter]—a tradition that we will reserve only for those summits and we are not duplicating today. [Laughter]\nA half a century ago, when Singapore was an island of rural villages and crowded tenements, few would have imagined a day like today. But Singaporeans pride themselves on being the \"little red dot\"—the little red dot on many maps, but with a very big impact on the world. In less than a generation, under the vision and stewardship of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Singaporeans transformed their nation from Third World to First. They did this with almost no natural resources, except one: the people of Singapore and their commitment to education and to progress and to innovation.\nOur Singaporean friends say that \"a long road reveals the strength of your horse; a long time reveals the heart of your friends.\" I first saw the heart of the people of Singapore as a young boy, during my years living in Southeast Asia. We see it now in the proud Singaporean Americans who enrich our Nation and who join us today, including a lot of \"uncles\" and \"aunties.\" [Laughter] We see it in all the Singaporean officers who attend [American; White House correction.] military academies, more than the rest of Asia combined.\nWe see our friendship in the collaborations between our innovators and entrepreneurs, from Silicon Valley to Singapore's Block 71. In fact, I understand that the Prime Minister himself recently wrote a program to solve sudoku puzzles—which Michelle will want. [Laughter] Then the Foreign Minister stepped in and translated that program into JavaScript. So I've got to start asking John Kerry to do that. [Laughter] Today our friendship and shared interests bring us together in common pursuit of a common vision: a peaceful and prosperous Asia-Pacific and a more secure world. As the United States has rebalanced our foreign policy to the Asia-Pacific, Singapore—and Prime Minister Lee, in particular—have been solid-rock partners. Singapore is an anchor of our presence in the region. We stand together for a regional order where every nation, large and small, plays and trades by the same rules. And we stand together to meet the threats of the 21st century, from terrorism to the spread of disease to climate change.\nIn this work, we draw strength from our people, two societies built on multiculturalism and on merit. In the United States, we call ourselves a \"melting pot\" of different races, religions, and creeds. In Singapore, it is rojak—different parts united in a harmonious whole. We're bound by the belief that no matter who you are, if you work hard and play by the rules, you can make it. What Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew once said of his country could be said of us: Both are populations of triers, \"prepared to try anything to improve themselves. [We] have only the future to go in quest of.\"\nPrime Minister Lee, Mrs. Lee: With our eyes focused on the future and united in our quest for the progress and security of our two peoples, we welcome you to the United States of America.\nPrime Minister Lee. Thank you.\nPresident Barack Obama and Mrs. Michelle Obama; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen; and Americans and Singaporeans who are here today: Thank you very much for this very kind invitation. I know it's a busy year. I watched you on television last week, and Michelle too. And it's an honor for Singapore to be received with such a warm welcome, especially as we celebrate 50 years of our diplomatic relations.\nThe first official visit by a Singapore Prime Minister to the United States was in 1967. President Lyndon Johnson received Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, our founding Prime Minister.\nSingapore was then newly independent. We were struggling to build a modern economy with no means to defend ourselves in a turbulent Southeast Asia. But Mr. Lee did not come to seek military or economic aid. At the time, America was divided over the Vietnam War. He came to take the measure of America's moods and intentions. He explained to his American friends why Asia mattered to America, and why the United States' active engagement was important to millions of people living in Southeast Asia. America's presence helped to contain the spread of communism and gave noncommunist Southeast Asian countries the crucial security, time, and space to consolidate and to prosper.\nAlmost 50 years later, the world has completely changed. The cold war is long over, and the threat of communism has disappeared. Asia is at peace, though tensions are not entirely absent. Southeast Asia has prospered, with countries cooperating peacefully as members of ASEAN.\nAmerica's endurance, policies, and actions have contributed greatly to this current peace and prosperity. Keeping your markets open to trade, deepening your partnership with ASEAN, and cooperating with countries in the region to enhance regional security, you have helped create the basis for a peaceful, rules-based regional and international order.\nPresident Obama, the U.S. rebalance to Asia is an important affirmation of a longstanding policy of the United States and has been warmly welcomed by all ASEAN countries. Your efforts to build a constructive relationship with China will set the strategic backdrop for the whole region and beyond. You have personally pushed for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, growing a small FTA that Singapore started, together with Chile, Brunei, and New Zealand, into what will be a major trading group linking both sides of the Pacific.\nI know that America has many preoccupations both at home and abroad. Some Americans are anxious and frustrated with economic uncertainty and the uneven results of globalization, trade, and foreign engagement. But the U.S. has many interests, investments, and friends in the region. These strengthen the United States.\nSingapore fervently hopes that the U.S. will stay engaged and maintain its indispensable role in the Asia-Pacific. In particular, we hope—and I'm sure the President shares this hope—that Congress will ratify the TPP soon. Not only will the TPP benefit American workers and businesses, it will send a clear signal, and a vital signal, that America will continue to lead in the Asia-Pacific and enhance the partnerships that link our destinies together.\nSingapore's own ties with the United States have remained steadfast through nine U.S. Presidents—five Republican and four Democratic—and three Singapore Prime Ministers. We will maintain these bipartisan links with whichever party wins the elections in November. We will continue to build and to deepen our economic and security relationships. We are partners in tackling the scourge of ISIS and other forms of violent extremism. Our armed forces take part in exercises together and interact regularly.\nOn this visit, President Obama and I will discuss expanding our already extensive cooperation to new areas, including cybersecurity and smart cities. But our ties reach beyond the government offices and corporate boardrooms to the hearts and minds of our people.\nThousands of Singapore students and people study and work in America, and thousands of U.S. companies operate out of Singapore. The largest American curriculum school outside the U.S. in the world is in Singapore and is a Singapore-American school.\nAudience members. Woo!\nPrime Minister Lee. And there are some alumni here, obviously. [Laughter]\nIn my many visits to America, I meet Singaporeans living in many different States, contributing in their own ways to their host country and their respective communities. And I also meet Americans who have been to Singapore and tell me about their Singaporean friends and their favorite hawker food. And I think many of them have met rojak too.\nSo I'm very grateful for this opportunity to renew our partnership on this 50th anniversary milestone. And I look forward to having many more occasions and reasons to celebrate this special relationship together.\nThank you, President Obama.", "timestamp": "2016-08-02", "title": "Remarks at a Welcoming Ceremony for Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore"}

Hello, everyone. Please have a seat. Once again, I'm honored to welcome my good friend, Prime Minister Lee and his delegation back to the White House. I have been fortunate to work with the Prime Minister throughout my Presidency, and I always value his insight, his counsel, and his outstanding partnership.\nLet me say that our thoughts today are also with former President Nathan, and we join the people of Singapore in praying for his full and speedy recovery.\nAs President, I've rebalanced American foreign policy so that we're playing a larger and long-term role in the Asia-Pacific, a region that is critical to our security and our prosperity. And as I said this morning, Singapore has played a vital role in that rebalance. With Singapore's support, the United States is engaging more deeply than ever across the region, including through ASEAN and the East Asia Summit. Given its strategic location, Singapore is an anchor for the U.S. presence in the region, which is the foundation of stability and peace. And, Mr. Prime Minister, I want to thank you for the invaluable contributions that Singapore has made to a central pillar of our foreign policy.\nToday we agreed to continue building on this progress. The U.S. and Singapore are united in our commitment to advancing regional security and stability. Our defense relationship remains one of the closest in Southeast Asia, with hundreds of American ships and aircraft rotating through Singapore each year. As I told the Prime Minister, we welcome Singapore's interest in purchasing the F-35 aircraft, and we'll also explore the possibility of Singaporean troops training on Guam.\nAt the same time, we'll continue working to strengthen regional institutions like ASEAN, in line with the principles we agreed to at Sunnylands earlier this year. And we reaffirmed our shared commitment to building a regional order where all nations play by the same rules and disputes are resolved peacefully, including in the South China Sea.\nWe agreed to do more to encourage economic growth and innovation among our economies. With a little over a decade, trade between our two countries has grown more than 50 percent. We're collaborating to jumpstart greater digital innovation, including research and development into technology and data to prove and promote Smart Cities concepts that can improve the daily lives of our citizens. We'll do more to connect our vibrant startup communities so that an engineer in Singapore can collaborate more easily with an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley or Austin, Texas.\nWith respect to trade, this is an issue that stirs great passion. Globalization means economies around the world are more integrated than ever and jobs and capital move across borders. Automation means that goods and products can be produced with fewer workers. And these forces of globalization and technology have not always benefited everybody evenly. There are fears and anxieties that people may be left behind. And these anxieties are legitimate. They can't be ignored. They have to be taken seriously. As I've said before, it means that we have to do everything we can to make sure that everybody shares in prosperity, that we have strong rules to protect workers, to promote high wages, to make sure that our citizens are getting the education and the training that they need.\nBut the answer cannot be to back away from trade and the global economy. It is here to stay. It's not possible to cut ourselves off given how integrated our economies are. And trying to pull up a drawbridge on trade would only hurt us and hurt our workers. So the answer is to make sure that globalization and trade is working for us, not against us.\nAnd that's why, today, we are reaffirming our commitment to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I'm a strong supporter of TPP because it will reduce tariffs—taxes, basically—on American goods from cars to crops and make it easier for Americans to export into the fastest growing markets of the world. TPP levels the playing field for our workers and helps to ensure countries abide by strong labor and environmental rules.\nSo this is an opportunity to grow our economies and write the rules for trade in the 21st century in a way that's equitable. It gives us a chance to advance American leadership, reduce economic inequality, and support good-paying jobs, all while strengthening critical strategic relationships in a vital region.\nSo I think not only is TPP important, but the Prime Minister and I agreed that we need to extend our partnership beyond just regional efforts. We have work to do on a global scale. Singapore was the first country in Southeast Asia to join the global coalition to destroy ISIL, and we're grateful that Singapore is making new contributions to this effort by providing valuable medical support to coalition forces.\nAs two nations on the forefront of digital innovation, we recognize the growing threats of cyber attacks, and we're going to continue to work to strengthen cybersecurity and to promote peaceful norms on how nations should operate in cyberspace.\nSingapore, the Garden City, helped to achieve the Paris climate agreement last year. And, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for your commitment to work towards joining the Paris Agreement this year. We're also working closely with the international community to reduce harmful aviation emissions and phase down HFCs. And our two countries will continue to work together to advance global health security so that the world is better prepared to address the threat of pandemics.\nLast point: We agreed to keep promoting people-to-people ties between our two countries. We're expanding our trusted travelers program to make it easier for Americans and Singaporeans to visit each other and do business together. I welcome Singapore's announcement of a new exchange program, which will include scholarships for students of our two countries. And through our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, we're going to keep empowering young people in Singapore and across the region to become the leaders of tomorrow in their own communities, in business, and in civil society.\nI'll note that I had a chance to meet one of those young Singaporean leaders at a YSEALI summit in Kuala Lumpur last year, a remarkable young woman named Carrie Tan, who is helping underprivileged women become financially self-sufficient. And Carrie talked about coming together with young people from across Southeast Asia. She said, \"We bonded in our common endeavor to seek to understand and learn from one another in pursuit of our aspirations to a better world.\" Young people like Carrie give me hope. And, Prime Minister Lee, based on our work together, I am confident that Singapore and the United States will continue to advance our shared aspirations for a better world for many years to come.\nWith that, let me turn it over to you, Mr. Prime Minister.\nPrime Minister Lee. Well, thank you, President Obama.\nPresident Obama, distinguished guests, I am very happy to be here for—on an official visit for the 50th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. I'd like to thank President Obama for his gracious hospitality and for his attention to our bilateral relations, as well as to the wider Asia-Pacific, and specifically, also for his good wishes on the condition of our former President, Mr. S.R. Nathan.\nThe President and I had a substantive conversation on a wide range of issues. We affirmed our strong multifaceted and longstanding partnership. Our strong economic ties are underpinned by the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. Singapore is America's largest trading partner in Southeast Asia, where the U.S. is Singapore's largest foreign direct investor. And many American companies run their regional headquarters in Singapore, and there are many Singapore companies also which are in America. And the relationship deepens year by year.\nIn the defense area, we have robust cooperation under the ambit of the memorandum—MOU in 1990 and the strategic framework agreement, which we concluded in 2005. Last year, we concluded the enhanced defense cooperation agreement, which expands cooperation into new areas, like humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, cyber defense, and counterterrorism.\nWe are also deepening security cooperation between our agencies in areas like counterterrorism, cybercrime, corruption, transportation security, and illicit trade enforcement and expanding into new areas like cybersecurity, where our agencies are signing an MOU to work together to protect national security and our economic interests against cyber attacks.\nWe also share an interest in Smart Cities, so we have discussed how cities can use technology to tackle problems from health care to transportation to delivery of public services. And there's a lot of interest from companies on both sides.\nUnderpinning the ties between the two countries are the friendships and the relationships between our peoples. Thousands of American students are studying and working in Singapore. Thousands of Singaporeans are studying and working in America. And last Sunday, I hosted a National Day reception for Singaporeans in our Embassy here, and 600 people showed up. It's fitting to mark this special occasion of our 50th anniversary that we are launching a scholarship for Singaporeans and Americans to enable undergraduates to do some exchanges in each other's country and grow our young people closer together and to get to know each other's societies, cultures, strengths, and opportunities to cooperate together. We've recently implemented a trusted traveler program that will also facilitate travel by Singaporeans to the U.S.\nThe President and I also discussed the TPP. And just now you heard the President give an eloquent explanation of why it is important to America and also to Asia. It's an integral component of America's rebalance to Asia. Apart from the economic benefits—trade, market access, standard setting—it's also vital from a strategic point of view and a strong signal of the U.S. commitment to continue its deep engagement in the region. We greatly appreciate the efforts of the President and his team to push for the TPP, which grew from a small FTA—which Singapore had started together with Chile, Brunei, and New Zealand, the P-4 group—and now the TPP will be a free trade agreement encompassing 40 percent of the world's population and one-third of the world's GDP. We are near the finish line, and we hope that the countries—particularly the U.S.—will be able to ratify the TPP as soon as possible.\nFinally, the President and I discussed our partnership in tackling global challenges, like counterterrorism. It's a problem for all countries. Every day in the newspapers, you read of new attacks somewhere: America, Europe, Middle East, closer to home in Indonesia and Malaysia. We in Southeast Asia are very concerned about this because the terrorists are active in many countries in the region. Several hundred, perhaps a thousand, from Southeast Asia are in the Middle East fighting ISIS. And we have witnessed attacks in both Indonesia and Malaysia that were mounted by ISIS followers under orders from ISIS operatives in the Middle East to launch attacks in their home countries.\nSo the efforts to counter ISIL, or ISIS, are crucial. And that's why Singapore is a member of the coalition. And we are making a modest contribution to the effort, and we're going to be sending a medical team to Iraq. We have already been participating with air-to-air refueling, image interpretation, and in other ways. And now we are going to send a medical team into Iraq.\nIt is also important to fundamentally address a root source of violent extremism in order to counter the underlying ideology of ISIL, as well as to address the issues of extremist and exclusive views being propagated by ISIL.\nSo these are major issues which we have discussed amongst our two countries, and we look forward to working together and taking our relationship even further forward.\nPresident Obama. Thank you.\nFirst question is Margaret Brennan [CBS News].\nRepublican Presidential Nominee Donald J. Trump/Libya/Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. Given the Republican nominee's recent comments about the Khan family and his statement that, if President, he would consider recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea, does it make you question his fitness to be President?\nAnd secondly, sir, on Libya. You've said in the past that the worst mistake of your Presidency may have been your failure to plan for the aftermath of that 2011 NATO intervention in Libya. Do you see your new decision to bomb ISIS there as a direct result of that?\nPresident Obama. Yes, I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as President. I said so last week, and he keeps on proving it. The notion that he would attack a Gold Star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country, the fact that he doesn't appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in Europe, in the Middle East, in Asia, means that he's woefully unprepared to do this job.\nAnd this is not just my opinion. I think what's been interesting is the repeated denunciations of his statements by leading Republicans, including the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader and prominent Republicans like John McCain. And the question, I think, that they have to ask themselves is, if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him? What does this say about your party that this is your standard bearer? This isn't a situation where you have an episodic gaffe. This is daily and weekly, where they are distancing themselves from statements he's making. There has to be a point in which you say, this is not somebody I can support for President of the United States, even if he purports to be a member of my party.\nAnd the fact that that has not yet happened makes some of these denunciations ring hollow. I don't doubt their sincerity. I don't doubt that they were outraged about some of the statements that Mr. Trump and his supporters made about the Khan family. But there has to come a point at which you say, somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn't have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world.\nBecause a lot of people depend on the White House getting stuff right, and this is different than just having policy disagreements. Now, I recognize that they all profoundly disagree with myself or Hillary Clinton on tax policy or on certain elements of foreign policy. But there have been Republican Presidents with whom I disagreed with, but I didn't have a doubt that they could function as President. I think I was right and Mitt Romney and John McCain were wrong on certain policy issues, but I never thought that they couldn't do the job. And had they won, I would have been disappointed, but I would have said to all Americans, they are—this is our President, and I know they're going to abide by certain norms and rules and common sense, will observe basic decency, will have enough knowledge about economic policy and foreign policy and our constitutional traditions and rule of law that our Government will work, and then we'll compete 4 years from now to try to win an election.\nBut that's not the situation here. And that's not just my opinion; that is the opinion of many prominent Republicans. There has to come a point at which you say, enough. And the alternative is that the entire party, the Republican Party, effectively endorses and validates the positions that are being articulated by Mr. Trump. And as I said in my speech last week, I don't think that actually represents the views of a whole lot of Republicans out there.\nWith respect to Libya, I have said on several occasions that we did the right thing in preventing what could have been a massacre, a blood bath in Libya. And we did so as part of an international coalition and under U.N. mandate. But I think that all of us, collectively, were not sufficiently attentive to what had to happen the day after and the day after and the day after that, in order to ensure that there were strong structures in place to assure basic security and peace inside of Libya.\nThe good news is, is that we now have the beginnings of a government in the Government of National Accord. They are serious about trying to bring all the factions together to start creating a basic security structure to begin to monitor Libya's borders and to cooperate internationally to deal with issues like ISIL penetration on their territory. And at the request of that Government, after they had already made significant progress against ISIL and had essentially pushed ISIL into a very confined area in and around Sirte, it is in America's national security interests in our fight against ISIL to make sure that they're able to finish the job. And so we're working in partnership with them to assure that ISIL does not get a stronghold in Libya, even as Libya begins what is going to be a long process to establish a functioning government and security system there.\nSo the good news is that they recognize these—this terrorist organization in their midst is contrary to their national interests, as well as the world's. And we're hopeful that having completed this process of driving ISIL out, they will then be in a position to start bringing the parties together inside that country. And not only us, but the Europeans and other countries around the world have a great interest in seeing stability in Libya, because that—the absence of stability has helped to fuel some of the challenges that we've seen in terms of the migration crisis in Europe and some of the humanitarian tragedies that we've seen in the open seas between Libya and Europe.\nPrime Minister Lee. All right, Nicholas [Nicholas Fang, Mediacorp].\nSingapore-U.S. Military Cooperation/Singapore-U.S. Relations/Singapore-China Relations\nQ. Thank you, PM Lee and President Obama. First question is for Prime Minister Lee. You've spoken about the continuation of the U.S. rebalance being a significant part of peace and stability in Asia. How do you envision this continuation proceeding in the next 50 years? And what role do you see Singapore playing in this context? What are some of the hot-button issues that we're likely to face as the U.S., hopefully, continues its rebalance?\nSecond question. You've mentioned the strong bipartisan links that Singapore has had with nine different U.S. Presidents from both sides of the political divide, a very strong record there. How would we address a U.S. leader which adopts a stance that it's more closed off, more antiglobalization, for example, if we see that in November?\nPresident Obama, I have a question about the military collaboration which has been a cornerstone of the relationship between Singapore and the U.S., especially coming on the heels of the latest announcement of the medical team to the global coalition against ISIS. With the rising threat of terror in Asia and indeed the rest of the world, the potential for military confrontation in the South China Sea, how do you see Singapore featuring in U.S. plans to address this going forward?\nAnd last question, \"Four more years\" is a phrase that I think you've been hearing a little bit in the past few weeks and months. And while that's not possible—[laughter]—if it were, how would you continue developing relationships with Singapore? What would be your key focus going forward, maybe the next 50 years as well? Thank you.\nPrime Minister Lee. Well, 50 years is a very long time. [Laughter] Fifty years ago, nobody imagined what the world would be like today or what Singapore would be like today, and that we would have such a deep and broad relationship and so many things to do together.\nWe would like to build on this for the next 50 years. It depends on how we—each of our countries does: in Singapore, whether we are able to remain stable, prosperous, open, successful; in America, whether you remain one of the dynamic, vibrant, leading economies in the world, in a world in which there are other powers, other centers of creativity and technology and science and progress, but yet it's a unique participant with a history of contributing to the world not just for your own interests, but because you believe that the world should be a better place for all countries.\nAnd if America can do that, and if Singapore can maintain our success, then I think there are many opportunities for us to make common cause together. And then, the rebalancing, which the President has enunciated and executed, will sustain and endure for many years to come. It will be a very different world. The countries will grow; other countries will slow down. Demographics will have a big factor to come. I mean, if we look at Japan, their population has been shrinking, and they will have to do something, somehow, to turn it around. Otherwise, 50 more years of population shrinking and you have a very small country left in terms of economy, in terms of influence internationally.\nSingapore, too, has demographic issues. America has a demographic change—the population is not shrinking, but the composition is changing. And in this situation, we have to adjust to a new world, maintaining our position and our ability to compete and yet knowing that it's not going to be the same as it was in 1946, when America was about half the world's GDP. So—or one-quarter of the world's GDP.\nSo that's the crucial factor over the next 50 years. As for what we do over bipartisan links, if there's a U.S. leader who is more closed off and wants to turn inward, I don't think this is the right forum or indeed there is any right forum for me to talk about U.S. politics in public at this moment. We will work with whoever is the U.S. administration, whichever party. We've worked with five Republican and four Democratic administrations. And our experience of American elections, Presidential elections, has been that many pressures build up during the election campaign. And after the elections, in a calmer, cooler atmosphere, positions are rethought, strategies are nuanced, and a certain balance is kept in the direction of the ship of state. It doesn't turn completely upside down.\nThe Americans take pride in having a system with checks of—with checks and balances so that it is not so easy to do things, but it is not so easy to completely mess things up. [Laughter] No. And we admire that, and sometimes, we depend upon that. [Laughter]\nPresident Obama. The—he's absolutely right. [Laughter] The wisdom of our Founders.\nWith respect to military cooperation, obviously, Singapore is a small country, but as I've said before, it punches above its weight. Because so much of our work in the Asia-Pacific region is not a matter of active conflict, but rather creating an architecture, a framework of rules and norms that keeps the peace and that has underwritten security for the region and for us for many years now. And Singapore is so often the adult in the room, the level head, that can help us work with a wide range of countries around certain issues, help defuse tensions. In many ways, the diplomatic work and collaboration that we do with Singapore is as critical, if not more critical, than the work militarily.\nBut what is also true is the nature of threats today, when you think of cyber threats or our concern about enforcing sanctions against North Korea to ensure nonproliferation of nuclear materials or being able to countermessage ISIL in a place like Southeast Asia and ensure information sharing with countries where there may be a budding terrorist threat, those are all issues of military finesse and intelligence and precision, and that—those are areas where Singapore excels.\nSo in addition to being a very important logistical hub and center for our operations, the partnership that we're able to maintain helps us to work with a whole range of other countries much more effectively than we would if Singapore weren't there and we were having to just try to gather up all these countries individually. And that's where ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, I think, has also been very important, because it is institutionalizing many of these practices in ways that, hopefully, avoids conflict in the first place, which would be in everybody's interest.\nWith the—as far as where the relationship goes, I think the Prime Minister is absolutely right: Fifty years from now, it's very hard to anticipate where we're going, but there are certain trends that I think are inevitable. The Asia-Pacific region will continue to grow and will continue to account for a larger share of the world's economy. There are going to be countries in the Southeast Asian region that look to follow the path of Singapore into a mature, advanced economy. It is going to be a big market. And the United States is still going to have a massive interest in maintaining itself as a Asia-Pacific power and in maintaining strong bonds of trade and commerce and scientific exchange and educational exchange.\nAnd given the close strategic interests, but maybe even more importantly, the close people-to-people ties between America and Singapore, I think we can anticipate that that will be just as strong 50 years from now as it is today.\nThe—Singapore has to take into account not just American interests. China is a big neighbor, and there are strong commercial ties and cultural ties there as well. And in that sense, Singapore actually can serve as a useful partner with us and with China to assure that the U.S.-Sino relationship moves in a productive way, which I think would be in the interests of both countries.\nSo this is going to be a central engine for world growth. And if we do a good job in maintaining stability, ensuring a rules-based order, continuing to promote greater transparency and reducing corruption in the region so that all people are benefiting from the rapid growth that is taking place, then I think the future 50 years from now will be bright.\nJordan Fabian [The Hill].\nTrans-Pacific Partnership/Democratic National Committee Cyber Attack/Cybersecurity/Russia-U.S. Relations\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. You're here today touting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but Hillary Clinton is against it. Her Vice Presidential nominee, Tim Kaine, has now reversed himself and is now against it. Donald Trump is too, meaning that the next President is opposed to this deal. So my question is, if you take both candidates at their word, how do you plan to get Congress to pass this deal during the lame duck, and what's your plan to convince Members to do so given the opposition I just described?\nAnd secondly, security officials inside and outside the Government have said they are almost certain that the hack of the Democratic National Committee came from Russia. Does it look to you like Russia is meddling in the U.S. election? And what impact should you—should that have on your administration's relationship with Moscow?\nPresident Obama. Good. Well, right now I'm President—[laughter]—and I'm for it. And I think I've got the better argument. And I've made this argument before; I'll make it again. We are part of a global economy. We're not reversing that. It can't be reversed, because it is driven by technology, and it is driven by travel and cargo containers and the fact that the demand for products inside of our country means we've got to get some things from other places, and our export sector is a huge contributor to jobs and our economic well-being. Most manufactured products now have—involve a global supply chain where parts are made in all corners of the globe and converge and then get assembled and packaged and sold. And so the notion that we're going to pull that up, root and branch, is unrealistic. Point number one.\nPoint number two: It is absolutely true—the evidence shows—that some past trade deals have not delivered on all the benefits that were promised and had very localized costs. There were communities that were hurt because plants moved out. People lost jobs. Jobs were created because of those trade deals, but jobs were also lost. And people who experienced those losses, those communities didn't get as much help as they needed to. And what is also true is, as a consequence of globalization and automation, what you've seen is labor, workers losing leverage and capital being mobile, being able to locate around the world. That has all contributed to growing inequality both here in the United States, but in many advanced economies. So there's a real problem, but the answer is not cutting off globalization. The answer is, how do we make sure that globalization, technology, automation—those things work for us, not against us. And TPP is designed to do precisely that.\nNumber one, it knocks out 18,000 tariffs that other countries place on American products and goods. Our economy currently has fewer tariffs, is more open than many of our trading partners. So if everybody agrees that we're going to have lower tariffs, that's good for American businesses and American workers. And we should want that; we should pursue it.\nNumber two, the complaint about previous trade deals was that labor agreements and environmental agreements sounded good, but they weren't enforceable the same way you could complain about tariffs and actually get action to ensure that tariffs were not enforced. Well, TPP actually strengthens labor agreements and environmental agreements. And they are just as enforceable as any other part of the agreement. In fact, people take them so seriously that right now, for example, Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms in Vietnam, changing their constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time.\nSo what we're doing is, we're raising standards for workers in those countries, which means it's harder for them to undercut labor standards here in the United States. The same is true for environmental standards. The same is true for things like human trafficking, where we've got a country like Malaysia taking really serious efforts to crack down on human trafficking. Why? Because TPP says you need to. It gives us leverage to promote things that progressives and people here in this country, including labor unions, say they care about.\nSo if you care about preventing abuse of workers, child labor, wildlife trafficking, overfishing, the decimation of forests, all those things are addressed in this agreement. I have not yet heard anybody make an argument that the existing trading rules are better for issues like labor rights and environmental rights than they would be if we got TPP passed.\nAnd so I'm going to continue to make this case. And I've got some very close friends, people I admire a lot, but who I just disagree with them. And that's okay. I respect the arguments that they're making. They're coming from a sincere concern about the position of workers and wages in this country. But I think I've got the better argument, and I've got the evidence to support it.\nAnd hopefully, after the election is over and the dust settles, there will be more attention to the actual facts behind the deal, and it won't just be a political symbol or a political football. And I will actually sit down with people on both sides, on the right and on the left. I'll sit down publicly with them and we'll go through the whole provisions. I would enjoy that, because there's a lot of misinformation.\nI'm really confident I can make the case, this is good for American workers and the American people. And people said we weren't going to be able to get the trade authority to even present this before Congress, and somehow, we muddled through and got it done. And I intend to do the same with respect to the actual agreement.\nYou had a second question. That was a long answer. I apologize, Mr. Prime Minister, but every once in a while—— Q. The DNC hack from Russia.\nPresident Obama. Oh. The FBI is still doing an investigation. You're right that there have been some assessments made that this might have been a Russian hack.\nWhat I can tell you without commenting on the specifics is that there are a lot of countries out there that are trying to hack into our stuff, governmental databases, but also private sector databases and non-for-profit databases. And this is why we've stood up such an aggressive effort to strengthen our cybersecurity.\nAnd we have provisions in place where if we see evidence of a malicious attack by a state actor, we can impose potentially certain proportional penalties. But that requires us to really be able to pin down and know what we're talking about. And so I don't want to get out ahead of the legal evidence and facts that we may have in order to make those kinds of decisions.\nMore broadly, we're trying to promote international norms and rules that say there are certain things that states should not be doing to each other when it comes to cyber attacks. There are certain things that are out of bounds. And those norms, I think, are going to slowly build and get more adherence over time. But it's—we're still early in the process. I mean, in some ways, the explosion of the Internet and its importance to our communication systems has far outstripped the legal architecture to protect them, and we're playing catchup. But we're going to have to keep on at it.\nIn terms of how it affects our relationship with Russia, look, I think we've already got a lot of differences with Russia on a whole bunch of issues. But I think that we've been able to try to stay focused on those areas where we still have a common interest, understanding that we have deep disagreements on issues like Ukraine, but perhaps, potentially, we have an interest in bringing an end to violence in Syria. How do we balance those issues? That's pretty standard statecraft at this point with Russia.\nIf in fact Russia engaged in this activity, it's just one on a long list of issues that me and Mr. Putin talk about and that I've got a real problem with. And so I don't think that it wildly swings what is a tough, difficult relationship that we have with Russia right now. But it's not going to stop us from still trying to pursue solutions so that we can, for example, implement the Minsk agreement and get Russia and those separatists to lay down arms and stop bullying Ukraine. That's not going to stop us from trying to make sure that we can bring a political transition inside of Syria that can end the hardship there. Okay?\nPrime Minister Lee. Can I say something about the TPP? I don't want to wade into your domestic politics, but looking at it from somebody on the other side of the Pacific who has been intimately involved and, in fact, triggered the whole process, because we started the P-4, the little FTA on which the TPP formed and has just become this important initiative.\nThe economic arguments for the TPP in terms of trade—I think the President has presented them eloquently, what the benefits are to American companies. It's a deal which the countries have negotiated, each one providing market access on their side in return for gaining market access on the other side, each one committing to rules in exchange for the other side committing to rules. It's a hard-fought bargaining process. The negotiators spent many trips, many nights, many dawns, and fought it out.\nBut actually, at the end of it, everybody must decide, is it a plus or a minus for them? And I think in your case, Mike Froman did a very good job as USTR. Our various trade representatives and negotiators did their best to make sure that they could bring back something which the political leaderships could stand by and support. And it's an achievement that all the members of the TPP, at the end of this, are still with us, and nobody has dropped out of this. So, obviously, there is something in it for each one of us.\nAnd I think we should also look at the other side of the economic benefit, which is not the producers—I am making, I am exporting, therefore I am earning a job—but also I am spending, I am consuming, I am importing, and because it's freed up trade, I am getting a wider range of products, of services, of opportunities, which will improve my livelihood. People talk about Walmart, that products come from all over Asia. Who benefits—Walmart? Many people in America, not just exporters, but even people living in the Rust Belt, people living in the middle—Midwest. These are part of your everyday invisible standard of living, and yet it's real, and it's valuable.\nSo in terms of the economic benefits, the TPP is a big deal. I think in terms of America's engagement of the region, you have put a reputation on the line. It is the big thing which America is doing in the Asia-Pacific with the Obama administration, consistently over many, many years of hard work and pushing. And your partners, your friends who have come to the table, who have negotiated, each one of them has overcome some domestic political objection, some sensitivity, some political cost to come to the table and make this deal.\nAnd if, at the end, waiting at the altar, the bride doesn't arrive—[laughter]—I think there are people who are going to feel—be very hurt, not just emotionally, but really damaged for a long time to come. Mr. Abe, for example, several of his predecessors thought seriously about and decided not to participate in the TPP. They came very close. They prepared the ground; they walked away. But Mr. Abe came through and decided to commit. Why? Because he wants to help. He wants his country to benefit and to open up its markets, and this is one way to do it.\nAnd you don't do this. Well, it hurts Mr. Abe is one thing, but it hurts your relationship with Japan, your security agreement with Japan. And the Japanese, living in an uncertain world, depending on an American nuclear umbrella, will have to say, on trade, the Americans could not follow through; if it's life and death, whom do I have to depend upon? It's an absolutely serious calculation, which will not be said openly, but I have no doubts will be thought.\nI think if you go beyond that, I'd like to link up the TPP question with an earlier question from Nicholas, which is, where do we go over the next 50 years? And that really depends whether we go towards interdependence and therefore peaceful cooperation, or whether we go for self-sufficiency, rivalry, and therefore a higher risk of conflict.\nAsia has tried both. The world has tried both. In the 1930s with the—with Smoot-Hawley, with the Depression, with a very difficult international environment, you went for protectionist policies, you had a rivalry with Japan, which led to war. After the war, because America was open, because you promoted trade, because you encouraged investments and encouraged other countries to open up, therefore, the Asia-Pacific has been peaceful and the Pax Americana has been a pax and not a war.\nIf over the next 50 years, you continue to work towards interdependence and cooperation and mutual prosperity, then 50 years from now, we can say these have been peaceful years and we have made further progress together. But if you go in the opposite direction, and you decide that this is a big Pacific but it's big enough to split it down the middle, and one chunk is mine, and the other chunk belongs to some of the Asians—China or India or Japan—I think that's a very different world. One of the reasons why you don't have a—you have a manageable relationship with China now is because you have trade with them. It's enormous; it's mutually beneficial; both sides want to maintain that relationship. If you didn't, it would be like the Soviet Union during the cold war when you had negligible trade and while you still had to find ways to work together, but it's much harder.\nNow, the TPP doesn't include China, although some people think it does, but the TPP points a direction towards the world, towards your whole orientation of your society. And if you set the wrong direction, maybe in the next 50 years, sometime, you will turn around, but it will cost you many years and the world will have to pay quite a high price.\nYes.\nTrans-Pacific Partnership/China/Asia-U.S. Relations\nQ. My name is Lee U-Wen from the Business Times in Singapore. Good afternoon, President Obama and Prime Minister Lee. I have two questions. The first is just a follow-up to the TPP. I mean, a lot has been said—everyone knows what's at stake—but what is the future of the TPP if it does not get ratified by January, the lame duck session? What—the fear is that if things wait too long, the—it might need to be reopened up for renegotiation and that will probably kill the deal. So what is—post-January, is that—how can we reassure the TPP nations and the people that there is the political will to get this done as soon as possible?\nThe second question is for President Obama. We are almost at the end of your 8 years in office. I would like you to evaluate the progress of the U.S. rebalance to Asia. What is the—what is something that you're most proud of? Is there something that you would have done differently? And what is your message to your successor, whoever he or she may be, to continue to engage Singapore, Southeast Asia, and the rest of the Asia-Pacific? Thank you.\nPresident Obama. Yes. Well, with respect to TPP, I thought that Prime Minister Lee's points were right on target. And this is an economic agreement, but what we've learned in history is, is that you can't separate out economic interests and issues and security issues and interests.\nAnd the Prime Minister is absolutely right. We have benefited from enormous peace and prosperity around the world, an unprecedented period where the great powers were not engaged in conflict, in part because of growing interdependence. If you think about those parts of the world where we still see conflict, where we still see high levels of violence, they're typically places that are less integrated into the world economy, and there's a reason for that.\nSo I think there is a powerful economic case, just a basic bread-and-butter case to be made about why this is good for Americans workers and good for American exports and ultimately good for American wages, if it's structured properly. But I also think that there is a strong security component to this. And what I also think is important is for people to recognize that the alternative is not TPP or some imaginary circumstance in which suddenly we're able to sell goods around the world wherever we want, but nobody is able to sell goods to us; where we can operate anywhere around the world under fair rules, but they can't operate here in that fashion. That's not—whatever is being imagined as the alternative is not the alternative.\nThe alternative is what we have today: a situation in which we don't have as many protections around labor and environmental issues as we'd like; a situation in which there are countries like Japan that sell a lot of goods here, but that keep pretty restricted access for U.S. companies and U.S. workers to their markets. And Prime Minister Lee is right that Prime Minister Abe of Japan, for example, has taken some significant risks because he knows that he needs to make his economy more competitive and as a consequence is willing to open up access that we haven't seen in the past. And that's a big market, still one of the top three economies in the world.\nSo the last point I'd make around this is China. As Prime Minister Lee mentioned, China is not a part of TPP. But if we don't establish strong rules, norms for how trade and commerce are conducted in the Asia-Pacific region, then China will. I mean, China is already engaging all the countries in the region around its own version of trade agreements. And they're sure not worried about labor standards or environmental standards or human trafficking or anticorruption measures. So you get a low-standard, lowest common denominator trade deal. And if America isn't creating high standards, then China's rules will govern in the fastest growing part of the world.\nThat's bad for us economically, but it's also bad for security interests. It's also bad for the interests in promoting norms against child labor or against human trafficking or making sure that everybody is working harder to raise conservation standards. And that's the alternative. That's the option. So I think it is very important for us to get this done.\nIn terms of assurances, nothing in life is certain, but we've got a pretty good track record of getting stuff done when I think it's important. And I will say this: that this actually is not just a Obama administration initiative. This concept began in a Republican administration. We pushed it through. We made it happen. We made sure that the things that I care about in terms of labor and environmental standards were incorporated into it. But historically, this has had strong bipartisan support.\nSo the bottom line is, we'll go out there, and we're going to make those arguments, and ultimately, I think we're going to be successful.\nIn terms of my rebalance legacy, across the board, we are just in the game. We are focused on Asia in a way that we weren't when I came into office. And the countries in Asia have noticed. Our alliances are stronger. Our security arrangements are deeper, whether in Australia or the Philippines or Singapore. Our defense budgets reflect our commitment to things like maritime security in the region. The continuing efforts around building the East Asia Summit architecture means that there's the kind of day-to-day interaction around a whole range of issues, whether it's disaster relief, or public health issues or counterterrorism. There's consultations that are taking place today that were not taking place 8 years ago.\nSo I think on every dimension, we are in a much stronger position to engage, influence, and learn from our Asia-Pacific partners.\nThe thing I probably enjoy most has been our Young Southeast Asian Leaders program, just because whenever I meet with the young people from ASEAN countries, I am inspired. It makes me very optimistic about the future and what's going to happen over those next 50 years. Because if you ask them about the future that they want to see, they are very much committed to an interdependent world, a world in which people are learning and exchanging ideas and engaged in scientific and educational exchange and a world in which people's different cultures and backgrounds are a source of strength and cooperation as opposed to conflict and fear.\nAnd that's true in Southeast Asia. That's true in Africa. That's true in Latin America. That's true in Europe. A lot of this fear—the choice that was posed by Prime Minister Lee between interdependence and self-sufficiency that is not achievable and ultimately rivalry and conflict—those who opt for rivalry are folks who are looking backwards. You talk to young people around the world, they understand that interdependence is the way that we're going to assure peace and prosperity for all of us for years to come.\nAnd so that may be the thing that has some of the most lasting impact. I suspect in some of those town hall meetings I've had, there are some future Prime Ministers and Presidents and business leaders and non-for-profit leaders that are going to do great things, and I'm glad to have been able to have played a small part in that.\nPrime Minister Lee. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2016-08-02", "title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore"}

An original was not available for verification of the content of this joint statement.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118954", "text": "1. At the invitation of the President of the United States of America Barack Obama, Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong made an official visit to the United States to celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations and to enhance the bilateral strategic partnership. For half a century, the two countries have built a strong relationship anchored by robust economic cooperation, security and defense cooperation, and enduring people-to-people ties. Beyond bilateral cooperation, the two countries have worked as close partners to build a rules-based economic and security order for the Asia-Pacific and to address challenges on the global stage, including economic prosperity, climate change, terrorism, transnational crime, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. On the occasion of the visit and the August 2, 2016 meeting between the two leaders, the United States and Singapore adopted this Joint Statement, affirming a continued commitment to advancing their strategic partnership in the areas below.\nSupporting Robust Economic Cooperation and Commercial Connectivity and Driving Innovation\n2. The U.S.-Singapore economic and commercial relationship provides a model to the world for how open markets and fair trade practices increase prosperity and drive innovation. Our shared economic priorities embrace trade liberalization, market reform, trade security, capacity building, innovation, entrepreneurship, climate change mitigation, clean energy, intellectual property protection, fair labor practices, and cyber security. Today, over 3,700 U.S. companies are located in Singapore, making Singapore a premier destination for U.S. businesses. A growing number of Singapore companies have also established a presence in the United States.\n3. The two sides noted that the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, the first such U.S. agreement in Asia and now in its 12th year, is a gold-standard agreement that has shaped other bilateral and multilateral FTAs in the region. The largest of these, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), reflects the commercial dimension of the U.S. rebalance to Asia and Singapore's commitment to high trade standards. Both countries emphasized the strategic and economic importance of all participating countries to ratify the TPP agreement expeditiously, and both committed to strengthen trade capacity building among TPP members.\n4. The two leaders affirmed efforts to support expanding economic ties through closer cooperation on bilateral tax issues, and noted ongoing discussions between the two sides on a tax information exchange agreement (TIEA), which will permit our two countries to exchange relevant tax information to enforce our respective tax laws, and an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) that provides for reciprocal automatic exchange of information with respect to certain financial accounts under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Both sides are committed to complete negotiations and sign the TIEA and the reciprocal FATCA IGA as soon as possible with the aim of doing so by the end of 2017. The leaders noted the two countries would maintain discussions on whether to negotiate an Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement in the future, taking into account double taxation with respect to both U.S. investments in Singapore and Singaporean investments in the United States and our mutual interest in avoiding base erosion and profit shifting by multinationals.\n5. The two leaders forged new cooperation on Smart City development and digital innovation. This includes (a) identifying opportunities for research collaboration between the National Science Foundation and the Singaporean National Research Foundation, (b) sharing of best practices and information exchange between both Governments on topics such as smart city policies, digital government, urban innovation and digital citizen engagement, through, among other things, the Digital Government Exchange forum to be held in Singapore and the Discover Global Markets: Building Smart Cities forum to be held in Chicago, and exchanges between the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Smart Nation Program Office in the Prime Minister's Office; and (c) facilitating exchanges for start-ups, as reflected in the MoU between the city of Austin and Singapore.\n6. The two nations look forward to deepening their economic cooperation including under the U.S.-ASEAN Connect (\"Connect\") initiative, announced in February 2016 by President Obama during the U.S.-ASEAN Leaders Summit at Sunnylands. As the strategic framework for U.S. economic engagement with ASEAN, Connect will build upon U.S. government economic initiatives within ASEAN to support regional integration efforts and cooperation with the private sector. Singapore offered support for a new Connect program focused on the digital economy, which could include innovation policy workshops under the Third Country Training Program. The two leaders confirmed collaboration on the third US-ASEAN Connect event to be held in Singapore in 2016, which will focus on themes such as digital economy and financial technology (FinTech). The inaugural Singapore FinTech Festival will be supported by the Connect Center in Singapore and the United States Department of Commerce. The two leaders welcomed the signing of an MOU between the US Department of Commerce and Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry to promote collaboration in the infrastructure sector between US and Singapore companies in Southeast Asia and third-party markets.\nEnhancing Security and Defense Cooperation\n7. The two leaders reaffirmed the strong bilateral defense partnership, underpinned by the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding and 2005 Strategic Framework Agreement, and most recently elevated by the 2015 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement. Singapore trains or stations approximately 1000 personnel each year in the United States. The United States deploys aircraft and ships to Singapore on a rotational basis to conduct a variety of regional maritime patrol activities covering counterpiracy, counterterrorism, humanitarian assistance, and disaster response. President Obama welcomed Singapore's continued interest in the F35 aircraft. The two leaders expressed support to explore new training opportunities for the Singapore Armed Forces in Guam, with an eye toward a potential long-term training detachment for the Republic of Singapore Air Force.\n8. The United States and Singapore are committed to broadening and deepening our cooperation to promote an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure global Internet that supports innovation, economic growth and social development. We are committed to ensuring that the digital economy remains a force for robust economic growth and prosperity. Both sides expressed strong support for the new U.S.-Singapore MOU on Cooperation in the Area of Cybersecurity, which lays a foundation for expanding our cooperation on cyber issues. The United States and Singapore affirmed their support for the multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance. We reaffirm, moreover, that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online. Both sides pledged to deepen their information exchange and sharing, to conduct new bilateral initiatives on critical infrastructure cybersecurity, and to continue to cooperate on cybercrime, cyber defense, and on regional capacity building activities, including through joint exercises, regular exchanges and visits, joint R&D and capability development, regional cyber capacity building programs or initiatives.\n9. The two leaders endorsed a common approach to international cyber stability, affirming that international law applies to State conduct in cyberspace, and committing to promote voluntary norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The United States and Singapore affirm that no country should conduct or knowingly support online activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public; that no country should conduct or knowingly support activity intended to prevent national computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) from responding to cyber incidents, or use CSIRTs to enable online activity that is intended to do harm; that every country should cooperate, consistent with its domestic law and international obligations, with requests for assistance from other states in mitigating malicious cyber activity emanating from its territory; and that no country should conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to its companies or commercial sectors.\n10. First discussed by both Leaders when they met in 2013, both leaders welcomed a new joint statement to extend the Law Enforcement and Homeland Security, and Safety Cooperation Dialogue for another 3 years, which reinforces the strong cooperation in law enforcement matters, including counter-terrorism and anti-corruption, between the two countries. The two leaders also welcomed the MOU, which will be signed in September, between Singapore's Home Team Academy (HTA) and the U.S. Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) to collaborate and share expertise and best practices in law enforcement training, leadership development, and capacity building. Both countries sought to increase bilateral and regional cooperation to combat internet and computer crime.\n11. The United States has partnered with Singapore on a number of issues related to transportation security. Both sides welcomed the 2016 signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Transportation Security Administration and Ministry of Transport on capability development in the Asia-Pacific Region through joint training and capacity building to enhance the level of aviation security standards. The first joint training outreach event will take place in Singapore in 2017 where Asia-Pacific States will be invited to participate.\nAddressing Regional and Global Challenges\n12. Both countries reaffirmed their commitment to ASEAN Centrality and to strengthening the regional architecture in the Asia-Pacific, including existing ASEAN-led mechanisms such as the East Asia Summit (EAS) and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) to better address common transnational challenges such as maritime security, climate change and trafficking-in-persons. The two leaders highlighted the importance of the U.S.-ASEAN strategic partnership, and the principles underpinning this relationship as outlined in the Sunnylands Declaration, for the peace, prosperity, and security of the Asia-Pacific.\n13. The two leaders highlighted the success of the U.S.-Singapore Third Country Training Program (TCTP), which has received more than 700 officials from across ASEAN since its establishment in 2012. They expressed support for its continued growth, including in the areas of trade policy, environment protection, and addressing non-traditional security threats. 14. The two leaders resolved to enforce UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2270, adopted in response to the DPRK's January nuclear test, which imposes unprecedented sanctions on the DPRK. The United States welcomed and offered full support for Singapore's commitment to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including the full and effective implementation of UNSCR 2270. Both leaders welcomed the commitment to expand bilateral cooperation to ensure the enforcement of this resolution, including on cargo inspections, shipping, and finance. The United States welcomed and offered full support of Singapore's commitment to strengthen advanced cargo screening procedures, which is essential to securing the global supply chain, including through Singapore's decision to conduct a three-year trial of the World Customs Organization's Cargo Targeting System. Such measures play an essential role in securing global commerce, not only against proliferation from all sources, but against terrorism and other criminal activity.\n15. The two leaders acknowledged the continued global threat posed by terrorism and the need to enhance information sharing on counterterrorism related issues. The two countries have also co-invested $30 million to date under the 2006 Combating Terrorism Research and Development agreement to improve capabilities to combat terrorism. Both leaders welcomed the extension of the agreement for another 10 years for investments up to $100 million. The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment as Counter-ISIL coalition members to degrade and defeat ISIL. President Obama welcomed Singapore's commitment to continue existing contributions to coalition efforts, including the deployment of refueling tanker aircraft and an Imagery Analysis Team, as well as Singapore's new commitment to deploy medical support to Iraq.\n16. The leaders reaffirmed the importance of maintaining regional peace and stability and upholding freedom of navigation in and overflight above the South China Sea. They emphasized the importance of resolving disputes peacefully, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, without resorting to the threat or use of force, in accordance with international law, including as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. They urged all parties to avoid actions that would escalate tensions, including the further militarization of outposts in the South China Sea. They reaffirmed their support for the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the expeditious conclusion of a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea.\n17. Both countries affirmed the importance of addressing climate change and transitioning towards a low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development pathway, and committed to pursue a range of initiatives to advance these goals. They resolved to work together to implement the historic Paris Agreement. The United States reaffirms its commitment to join the Agreement this year, and Singapore commits to taking the domestic steps necessary to join as soon as possible, with a view to joining in 2016. They also called on all nations to support the Agreement's early entry into force in 2016. Both nations affirmed the importance of supporting the development and implementation of the transparency framework established under the Paris Agreement, with common modalities, procedures and guidelines. Both nations look forward to the early operationalization of the Capacity-building Initiative for Transparency. They resolve to explore opportunities to collaborate on institutional and technical capacity-building activities to help other Parties meet the requirements of the transparency framework. Both countries affirmed their commitment to work to adopt an ambitious and comprehensive hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) phase-down amendment in 2016 within the Montreal Protocol pursuant to the Dubai Pathway. They supported the adoption of a global market-based measure (MBM) at the upcoming Assembly of the International Civil\nAviation Organization for implementation from 2020, as part of a collective effort to address climate change through a comprehensive basket of measures. The leaders emphasized the importance of a global MBM in supporting the aviation industry's desire to grow sustainably and prevent a patchwork of national or regional MBM schemes given the cross-border nature of international flights.\n18. The two leaders commended the adoption of the fifth Plan of Action in August 2015 under the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement's environmental cooperation Memorandum of Intent (MOI). To protect our shared environment, the United States and Singapore commit to strengthen cooperation to conserve biodiversity and ecosystems by combating the illegal trade in CITES species, improving the capacity of institutions, and strengthening policies to ensure effective implementation and enforcement of environmental laws. Singapore also stated its intention to positively consider implementing a ban on the domestic trade in ivory. Both countries also look forward to deepening the exchange of information on environmental policies, best practices and the use of innovative environmental technology and pollution management techniques, and to work closely together and with other WTO Members to conclude an ambitious Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) that eliminates tariffs on a wide range of environmental goods by the end of the year. We also resolve to cooperate to conserve our oceans and to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, including by implementing port State measures in recognition of the importance of concerted international action to address IUU fishing as reflected in regional and international instruments, including the Port State Measures Agreement.\n19. The United States and Singapore affirmed their commitment to advance the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to assist other countries to implement the International Health Regulations (IHR) and prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats, whether naturally occurring, deliberate or accidental. In 2016, the United States underwent a Joint External Evaluation (JEE) of its national capabilities to achieve the GHSA and other IHR-related targets and will publish the results. In 2017, Singapore will initiate a JEE. The United States has made a commitment to assist at least 31 countries to achieve the GHSA targets, and Singapore will join two GHSA Action Packages to share best practices to assist others. Singapore will also provide experts, where available, to support the assessments of other countries, including within ASEAN.\nStrengthening People-to-People Ties\n20. Both the United States and Singapore affirmed their commitment to further strengthen the already deep bonds of friendship, cooperation, and mutual understanding between the peoples of the two countries. The United States welcomed the launch of an exchange scholarship program to mark 50 years of diplomatic relations and deepen people-to-people ties. The scholarship will fund summer exchange programs for 50 Singaporean and 50 U.S. students over the course of the next 5 years. In support of the U.S. Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI), which has grown into a network of more than 80,000 youth across the region, the U.S. will convene an Urban Planning Workshop in 2017 in Singapore. Both sides recognized the success of the YSEALI program and the contributions made by its Singaporean participants in promoting innovation, inspiring cross-ASEAN connectivity, and advancing bilateral ties.\n21. The United States was pleased to open Global Entry eligibility to include citizens of Singapore from June 2016. Singapore in turn allowed Americans to apply for its enhanced-Immigration Automated Clearance System (eIACS) under the Trusted Traveller Program (TTP). Following the Joint Statement issued by the United States and Singapore on Dec. 1 2014, both countries had worked together to officially launch the TTP on June 27, 2016. The TTP reaffirmed the strong trust and ties that the United States and Singapore enjoy given that Singapore is the 1st ASEAN country to be in the program. These trusted traveler programs will make travel between our two nations more convenient and secure for travelers.\nEnhancing our Enduring Partnership\n22. Through a half-century of diplomatic relations, the United States and Singapore have forged an expansive and enduring relationship by cooperating on issues of mutual interest and shared principles. Both leaders committed to further enhance the U.S.-Singapore strategic partnership, making it deeper, more substantive, and more effective to better support peace, stability, and cooperation across the region and around the world.", "timestamp": "2016-08-02", "title": "Joint Statement by President Obama and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 8:10 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Ho Ching, wife of Prime Minister Lee. Prime Minister Lee referred to former U.S. Ambassador to Singapore Steven J. Green; and Col. Frank W. McGurk, USA (Ret.), and his wife Mary. A portion of these remarks could not be verified because the audio was incomplete.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118790", "text": "President Obama. Good evening, everybody. Nearly 50 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson welcomed to the White House the first Prime Minister of a newly independent Singapore, a man he hailed as \"a patriot, a brilliant political leader, and a statesman of the New Asia,\" Singapore's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. A half century later, Michelle and I are honored to welcome his son: a patriot, a brilliant political leader, and a statesman of a rising, thriving Asia-Pacific. Prime Minister Lee and Mrs. Lee, welcome.\nNow, we all know how seriously Singaporeans take their food. [Laughter] In Singapore, even the street vendors—the hawker stalls—earn Michelin stars—[laughter]—which creates some pressure this evening. We have a lot to live up to. We were tempted to offer each of you a \"Singapore Sling\" or some chili crab. However, for those of you who know its unmistakable scent, which never seems to go away, you'll understand why we are not serving a fruit known as durian here in the White House. [Laughter]\nWith this visit we're celebrating 50 years of diplomatic relations between our two nations. Yet even as we mark this anniversary of our formal ties, we honor bonds that stretch back at least 180 years, when Singapore was still a colony and the United States was not far removed from being one ourselves. The first American representative to Singapore was a planter named Joseph Balestier, whose name lives on in one of Singapore's neighborhoods. His wife Maria's legacy lives on in a beautiful church bell that once signaled the evening curfew, and which now rests in Singapore's National Museum, a bell cast in the foundry of Maria's father, Paul Revere. You may have heard of him.\nIt's a reminder that as we pursue a more peaceful and prosperous order in the Asia-Pacific, our partnership is rooted in more than strategic interests. We're bound together by history, by family, and by friendship. It's the dedication of our men and women in uniform, flying F-15s together across the skies of Idaho. It's the excitement of our students and entrepreneurs, who cross the ocean to learn and to work with each other. And it's the leadership of a son of Singapore who is respected around the world and a trusted partner to the United States.\nPrime Minister Lee, when you were sworn in again last year, you spoke of the shared purpose that animates the people of Singapore: \"Each of us giving our best, united by our shared ideals, our faith in this nation, and our belief that here we can build something special together.\" What is true of Singapore is true of the relationship between our two countries.\nAnd so as Singapore prepares to celebrate its National Day, and 50 years into a shared journey with the United States, I propose a toast.\n[At this point, the President was handed a glass of wine.]\nPresident Obama. Thank you, sir.\nTo Prime Minister and Mrs. Lee, and to the friendship and partnership between our peoples, let's continue to build something special together. Onward, Singapore—Majulah Singapura. Onward, America. Cheers. Yam seng. [President Obama offered a toast.]\nPrime Minister Lee.\nPrime Minister Lee. Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: I'd like to thank President Obama for his very kind words. Ho Ching and I are delighted to be here. And we are touched by your warm welcome and gracious hospitality. We especially appreciate Mrs. Obama's personal efforts to make our visit a successful one, and for personally overseeing the splendid arrangements for the State Dinner.\nMr. President, when you addressed the U.N. in 2014, you said that \"when nations find common ground, not simply based on power, but on principle, then we can make enormous progress.\" And I'm glad to say that tonight, on the 50th anniversary of our diplomatic relations, our two countries share much common ground and have made great progress together based on shared principles, convergent interests, and mutual respect.\nI remember my first meeting with you at the Senate. It was May 2007. You were in the midst of a hard-fought Presidential campaign and not yet the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. [Laughter] But I was struck by your focus, your informed interest in Asia, and your desire to cement America's role in it.\nYour years growing up in Indonesia gave you direct experience of Southeast Asia's cultures and challenges. As President, your personal leadership and decision to rebalance to Asia has won America new friends and strengthened old partnerships, including with Singapore. Over half a century working together on multiple issues, Singaporeans and Americans have made many enduring and close personal friendships. So I'm happy to see many of Singapore's old friends here tonight, such as Ambassador Steve Green, who you may not know played a crucial role in teeing up a certain midnight golf game between a lame duck President, Bill Clinton, and our Prime Minister, Mr. Goh Chok Tong, on a rainy night in Brunei during an APEC meeting—[laughter]—which led to the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. [Laughter] Which shows what can be done even during lame duck periods. [Laughter]\nSingapore admires America's dynamism, vibrancy, and capacity for self-renewal. These qualities attract the best and brightest from around the world. Thousands of Singaporeans study in the U.S., attracted not just by the excellent academic education, but also the unique dynamism of your campuses and the ethos of your society.\nThis is something that Singapore hopes to emulate as we seek to tap into this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship. The National University of Singapore has set up overseas colleges in Silicon Valley and New York so that our students from Singapore can intern with high-tech startups. And we are also launching a U.S-Singapore 50th anniversary scholarship to promote greater exchanges and understanding between our young people.\nAmerica excels not just through sheer individual talent, but by working together with others. At this year's International Mathematics Olympiad, the U.S. team came in top, beating Singapore. [Laughter] And you did so in a remarkable, open, and collaborative manner. You invited students from other competing countries to the U.S. to train with you, including two Singaporeans who benefited from the exposure. It's what globalization means: You compete, but you also cooperate and learn from one another.\nIn sport, too, some of Singapore's Olympic hopefuls have come to train with America's best athletes. One of our swimmers, Joseph Schooling, is a member of the University of Texas\nswim team and was a 2016 NCAA champion in the 100 meters and 200 meters butterfly. And we hope he will do well in Rio.\nOur Armed Forces personnel have taken part together in international operations in Afghanistan and in the Middle East. They also train alongside each other on professional courses and joint exercises. I, myself, as a soldier, attending U.S. courses, have personally experienced the dedication, the competence, and the warmth of our hosts. I made good friends, and we still keep in touch after many decades. And they include Frank and Mary McGurk, who were my military sponsors at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas nearly 40 years ago. And they are here tonight.\nAmerica is a great nation, not just because of your power and your wealth, but because of your high ideals, openness, and generosity of spirit. You seek to build a world where countries can prosper together. You make common cause with others to fight the problems which plague mankind, be it extremist terrorism, poverty, Ebola, or climate change. That is why 70 years after the Second World War, America is still a welcome power in Asia. We hope these strengths and qualities will be emulated by others and will enable you to remain engaged in our region for many more years.\nTo mark the 50th anniversary of our relations, Singapore has named an orchid hybrid in honor of President and Mrs. Obama. And this is a hybrid of breeds native to Singapore and Hawaii, where the President was born—most of us believe. [Laughter] We think it's a fitting tribute to America's first Pacific President and a beautiful symbol of the flourishing ties between our countries.\nLadies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast to the health and success of the President of the United States.\nTo the President.\n[Prime Minister Lee offered a toast.]\nPrime Minister Lee.

He discussed with them ways to better support officer training as well as the need to ensure police have the resources they need to engage in community policing.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see correction marked by an asterisk below.\n11:44 A.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. Nice to see you all. You'll have to bear with me a little bit today. I'm fighting off one of those nasty summer colds. So I'll try to keep the sniffling and sneezing to a minimum up here.\nI don't have any statements at the top, Josh, so we can go straight to your questions.\nQ: You didn't get Zika did you?\nMR. EARNEST: I hope not. (Laughter.)\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to start briefly with the arrest this morning of a D.C. Metro Transit police officer charged with trying to help the Islamic State. The first arrest on terrorism charges of a law enforcement officer post 9/11. How concerning for the White House is that? And do you know anything additional about what investigators are looking at there?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I know that the Department of Justice has issued a rather lengthy statement detailing some of the evidence that they've collected in this case. So I'll let them speak to the details.\nI think what I would just say more generally is the Department of Justice and law enforcement officials at the FBI take quite seriously the responsibility that they have to protect the American people. And we've seen the FBI and U.S. attorneys across the country make announcements about arrests that they have made, and even convictions that they have won against individuals who have sought to support extremist organizations. And we're mindful of the risk that is posed by homegrown extremists. And we know that part of the strategy that is used by extremist groups around the world, including ISIL, is to use social media to try to recruit followers in countries around the world. We know that that certainly is true here in the United States, as well. And the FBI and the Department of Justice take quite seriously the responsibility that they have to use the relevant resources at their disposal to pursue these investigations and do everything possible to protect the American people.\nQ: I wanted to ask about Donald Trump's suggestion that the election might be rigged against him. I know you've talked a lot about one of the reasons that the White House is putting so much effort into the transition planning is because of the importance of the public's confidence in continuity of transitions of power here in the U.S. So I'm wondering if the White House thinks that comments like his, particularly when there's nothing to back them up, risks eroding that confidence and creates a situation where people -- where you don't have faith in the confidence of a presidential election.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, I know that this was the subject of some debate at the end of the last presidential election when some supporters of Governor Romney complained of skewed polling. So this is not a new claim. I would just note that it is often a claim made by people who don't end up winning elections.\nWhat I'll just say in general is that the cornerstone of our democracy is the ability of eligible voters, citizens, to cast a ballot and to have it counted. And the more that people participate in that system, the more that people participate in that process, the stronger our democracy. And the President has made that case not just in front of audiences full of Democrats, he's made that case in front of audiences that include people that don't share his views, or may not even have voted for him in the two previous elections.\nSo the President believes strongly that our democracy benefits when more people are engaged. And he's certainly going to encourage people to engage in that debate. You've seen the United States Department of Justice pursue cases in the courts to ensure that the rights of eligible voters are protected when it comes to participating in elections. And the President has actually worked in bipartisan fashion, including signing up the lawyer for Governor Romney's campaign to offer up advice about what we can do to make it easier for eligible voters to participate in the process. And the reason for all of that is the President believes that our democracy benefits when the American people are engaged in that debate and when as many eligible voters as possible cast ballots.\nQ: I guess to put it more bluntly, can the U.S. government provide assurances that this election, at least from a mechanical standpoint, will not be rigged against Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, the President has confidence in the integrity of our electoral process, and everybody else should too.\nQ: Secretary Jeh Johnson this morning said that one of the things that the U.S. should look into is deeming the election's infrastructure part of the critical infrastructure in the country, which should obviously trigger some additional protections and perhaps eligibility for federal funds. Is that an idea that the President supports?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know this is an idea that other members of the President's national security team have also discussed. And I think this should be an indication that this administration has placed the highest priority on cybersecurity. The administration understands that there are risks in cyberspace, and those risks take a variety of forms. And that's why the President included in his budget proposal more than a billion dollars to increase our cyber defenses in this country, both to protect the public sector and government networks, but also to more effectively work with the private sector to ensure that critical infrastructure that's maintained by the private sector is protected as well.\nUnfortunately, as we've discussed in here many times, Republicans in the Congress refuse to even hold a hearing to discuss the President's budget proposal. That's quite unfortunate and I think raises questions about whether or not they have their priorities in order. But when it comes to how important our cybersecurity is in this country, the President and this administration have made that a priority and there are risks out there, but I think the American people can have quite a bit of confidence in our ability to mitigate those risks and to confront that threat.\nTim.\nQ: On Zika, New York's attorney general is targeting companies today that make phony products -- they say they fight Zika but they don't. How concerned is the administration that some companies might be taking advantage of public fear about Zika and selling these kinds of things?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, at the risk of disappointing the New York attorney general, I have not seen those reports. But I can tell you that our experts here in the federal government and in state and local governments across the country are very focused on the risk from Zika. And we would encourage people who are concerned about that risk to consult their doctor, to consult the publically available resources, either from state and local public health officials or even from federal officials at the CDC.\nThe CDC has been working very effectively with local public health officials across the country to meet this threat. So if people have questions about steps they can take to protect themselves or members of their family from the Zika virus, we would encourage them to consult the experts and to follow that advice.\nQ: And on Zika also, can the administration act without Congress to relax some of the restrictions on some of the pesticides that have been restricted over the years to fight Zika?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I would say about this is that the administration is going to continue to rely on the advice of experts at the EPA and at the CDC in determining what is the most effective way for us to try to fight mosquito populations that could carry this virus. And I know that our public health professionals and environmental experts have determined that in some places -- in South Florida, for example -- aerial spraying for mosquitos could help limit the size of the mosquito population that carries the virus.\nSo we're willing to consider a range of options to implement effective what's called vector control measures -- essentially trying to fight the mosquito population. In some cases, it does raise questions about environmental safety. It does raise scientific questions about how effective certain chemicals are against this particular mosquito species that carries the virus. So we're mindful of all those questions and we'll certainly rely on the advice of experts in making decisions about the most effective strategies to deploy to fight the mosquito population.\nQ: And organophosphates have been mentioned as one pesticide that could be relaxed. Is that one of the options?\nMR. EARNEST: It's not clear to me exactly what assessment the EPA has made about that specific chemical, but you can ask them about that.\nQ: And just lastly on Zika. In Florida, we're finding out just how hard it is to fight. I mean, the mosquitos can breed in a bottle cap full of water. What other steps can be taken, even if more money got to the fight?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have known since January that this is a particular species of mosquito, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is a tough one to fight. As you point out, it can thrive in a very small amount of water. It can reproduce rather quickly. And, obviously, it is a carrier of this virus. So the President and his team have been planning for months now. It's unfortunate that Republicans in Congress have not stepped up to the plate to play their role in providing necessary funding to ensure that we're doing everything we possibly can to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\nSo you already know that there are emergency response teams that have been deployed by the CDC to South Florida to work closely with local officials in this effort. Fortunately, in a place like Florida, there are public health professionals who have experience in fighting mosquito-borne diseases. The mosquito population in South Florida is larger than it is in many other communities in the country, and so when it comes to countering not just the Zika virus but things like Dengue and Chikungunya, there is an expertise that is already in South Florida that understands what's necessary to try to fight those mosquito populations and limit the risk to American citizens in those communities.\nSo they're very focused on this effort. The support that can be provided by the federal government can come in the form of additional resources to fight mosquitos. It can also come in the form of providing researchers who can help track the spread of the disease. This includes widespread testing to determine who exactly has it, where they are, and how they may have gotten it so we can take appropriate steps to contain the spread. There's also work that needs to be done as it relates to expanding the capacity of labs across the country to do tests of diagnostics. There's also important work to be done as it relates to developing vaccines.\nThe NIH earlier today announced that they had begun phase 1 trials of a particular Zika vaccine. That's good news. The bad news is we already know that they will not be able to begin phase 2 testing if Congress doesn't act. And if Republicans continue to obstruct funding for the Zika virus, then that's going to limit our ability to rapidly develop the kind of vaccine that next summer or the summer after that could start protecting the American people from the Zika virus and limit the risk associated with this particular disease.\nSo, again, Republicans in Congress have a lot of explaining to do. And I don't think there's going to be a lot of sympathy for their position. They left on a seven-week recess a day early, at the height of mosquito season, and have basically told the American people good luck. And I think the American people expect a lot more from their government, and they certainly expect a lot more from their elected members of Congress.\nAnd the irony here is that the states that are at greatest risk are those states that are overwhelmingly represented in Congress by Republicans. It makes the Republican position on this issue all the harder to explain, let alone justify. So the response that you'll see from the federal government is going to continue to be robust. We're going to continue to work effectively, even with Republican officials in Florida, to try to protect the people of Florida from this virus.\nAt some point, Republicans in Congress are going to have to fulfill their responsibility.\nMike.\nQ: Could you talk a little bit about the report in the Journal today of the pallets of cash that went to Iran? Obviously, the cash, the amounts were talked about and reported on at the time -- that's not a surprise. The detail of the procuring the amount in foreign currencies and putting them on a plane and flying them in on the same day that the hostages were being released, prisoners were being released is what seems to be causing a lot of reaction. Donald Trump tweeted that it's a big scandal. Other Republicans have said that it essentially proves that you guys were paying ransom directly for the folks that were released. So what do you guys have to say about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, not a whole lot different than we said six months ago, Mike, as I appreciate you pointing that out in the context of your question. I know that this is actually -- I think you devoted a significant portion of your weekend back in January to covering that story. So you have my continuing sympathies for that.\nBut listen -- so you guys know the facts here. But for those who are flailing in an attempt to justify their continued opposition to the deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, I'll review the facts. The facts in this case are I guess two relevant ones, and then we can pursue others that you feel like we need to discuss.\nThe first is, this $400 million is actually money that the Iranians had paid into a U.S. account in 1979 as part of a transaction to procure military equipment. That military equipment, as it relates to this $400 million, was not provided to the Iranians in 1979 because the Shah of Iran was overthrown. So that was the right decision. It's also why it was hard for the United States to make an argument in this case that we could just keep the money. So what the United States did was resolve a longstanding claim at The Hague that saved the American people potentially billions of dollars.\nNow, as it relates to the details, the fact of the matter is the United States does not have a banking relationship with Iran. And the reason for that is that the administration -- the Obama administration -- has kept in place tough financial sanctions against Iran because of a variety of concerns that we have about their behavior, including their support for terrorism, their violation of human rights, and a ballistic missile program that they maintain that continues to be inconsistent with U.N. Security Council regulations -- resolutions.\nSo the facts of this are quite clear. And again, I think it's an indication of just how badly opponents of the Iran deal are struggling to justify their opposition to a successful deal that has prevented and continues to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\nQ: But can you just respond to two specific instances, though? One is, was this money ransom for the folks that were released?\nMR. EARNEST: No, it was not. It is against the policy of the United States to pay ransom for hostages.\nQ: Was this a coincidence?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mike, here's -- again, we talked about this in January, too, so let's talk about this. There was a conscious, strategic decision that was made on the part of the Obama administration as we were implementing the deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon to resolve other longstanding concerns that we had with Iran. And that included securing the release of five American citizens who had been unjustly detained in Iran and closing out a longstanding financial dispute in a way that saved the American people potentially billions of dollars.\nSo this all came to a head at the same time because we were addressing and resolving longstanding concerns with Iranian behavior. And the benefits are almost too long to mention, but the highlights are: Iran is not developing a nuclear weapon; Iran has had to scale back significant aspects of their nuclear program; Iran released five Americans who were unjustly detained on Iranian soil; and we resolved a 35-year-old financial claim with the Iranians in a way that saved Americans potentially billions of dollars. There are many other benefits we can get into as well, but those are the highlights.\nQ: One other thing, and then I'll let my colleagues go. But you cited the sanctions on Iran, the banking sanctions on Iran because of concerns of terrorism and all of that that are still in place. There are people who say, yeah, but handing over a pallet full of cash is actually less secure. I mean, that money could be handed off and distributed to terrorists potentially with even less ability to track, ability to know what's being purchased -- arms, other things. So was the White House at all concerned that they were essentially handing the Iranians a pot of untraceable money that is potentially going to fall into the hands of people who we don't like very much, or doing things that we don't want to be doing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, so let's just review. As I mentioned earlier, the United States continues to have concerns with some of Iran's nefarious activities. But the CIA Director just last week addressed concerns that had been raised by critics of the deal about how money that Iran has received since January has been spent in Iran. And I don't want to ruin the surprise here, but the Iranian government has spent the money largely in the way that we expected that they would.\nSince the international community worked together to impose sanctions on Iran because of their nuclear program, their economy suffered. So it makes sense that when Iran got revenue as a result of the Iranian agreement, for example -- the nuclear agreement, for example, they used that money to prop up their currency that had been significantly devalued by the sanctions regime. We also know that when Iran was subject to all these sanctions, they were not able to finance infrastructure improvements. Their infrastructure was crumbling. So we know that they used a revenue from sanctions relief to start investing in infrastructure. We also know that they had significant debts that they were unable to pay, and they were eager to repay those debts, and that, frankly, their creditors were eager to collect. So --\nQ: But you don't know specifically how that specific pile of cash, literally, was used -- do you? Do you know how specifically that money was spent by the Iranians?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, it's Iranian money. And I think what is true from all of the money that Iran has received since January, including from sanctions relief -- which actually, as we know, is more than $400 billion [million]* -- it's much smaller than the hundreds of billions of dollars that critics of the deal predicted, but we can get to that in a little bit too. The analysis that we've done confirms what we predicted -- is that, largely, that money was spent to address the dire economic condition of the nation of Iran.\nThe President was quite forward-leaning, in advance of the nuclear deal even being completed, in acknowledging that we know that Iran supports terrorism. We know that Iran supports Hezbollah and the Assad regime. And it certainly is possible that some of the money that Iran has is being used for those purposes too. That's precisely why this administration, on the front end, has been deepening our engagement with our partners in the Middle East to counter those activities; to more effectively interdict illicit materials that could be used to support Iran's ballistic missile program; to more effectively strengthen the defenses of our partners to counter Iran's nefarious activities.\nBut the bulk of the money we know has been going to shoring up their economic weakness. And that's exactly what we predicted. What has not happened, and where the critics of the deal get it wrong, is Iran has not enjoyed hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Iran has not been able to use hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief to support terrorism or to prop up the Assad regime. People who have made that prediction were either badly misinformed or lying to the American public. And I'll leave it to them to explain why their prediction didn't come true. It does explain, however, why they continue to resurface six-month-old news stories to try to justify their opposition to an agreement that has benefitted the American people, both financially and when it comes to our national security.\nOlivier.\nQ: I got a couple for you following up on my colleagues' questions. A question about cybersecurity. Could you lay out your degree of concern or lack thereof about the integrity of voting machines, given that we've talked now a lot of hacks and about cybersecurity?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think anybody who's watched \"Scandal\" on ABC -- (laughter) -- would recognize that this makes for an interesting storyline.\nQ: Is Kerry Washington going to walk out --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know.\nI think the point here, Olivier, is that elections are conducted at the local level, and there are government officials in cities and counties all across the country that are responsible for administrating elections. So it's tough to generalize given the varied nature of election infrastructure in this country. There are some places that still use paper ballots. Presumably, those can't be hacked.\nBut there are other places that do use electronic voting machines. They have a variety of -- there's a lot of different software that is used. So the point is that it's important for the federal government to offer support to state and local governments as they seek to take appropriate steps to protect the integrity of elections.\nI guess you might also say that that varied infrastructure and those different systems also pose a pretty difficult challenge to potential hackers. So it's difficult to identify a common vulnerability throughout the system. But that also poses -- so I think people can take some solace in that.\nAt the same time, it also means that it's hard to put forward a blanket prescription for securing those systems. But certainly the federal government is committed to working with state and local officials to protect a wide range of critical infrastructure that's operated at the local level.\nQ: But you say that these concerns have not risen to the level of the President. You talk about the local responsibility, that's true. But, for example, DHS has a lot of relationships with local governments --\nMR. EARNEST: That's right.\nQ: -- on things that properly devolve to them. So you're not aware of a request from a particular state asking DHS for help in securing their systems?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to all those conversations. I think what I would go back to is I guess what somebody raised earlier, which is that the President's national security team has acknowledged that we should consider the benefits and propriety of essentially labeling our electoral system in this country as part of critical infrastructure that is subject to additional protections that can be provided by the federal government. So that's something that is being actively considered by the President's national security team. And presumably if there's an announcement about that, it would come from the Secretary of Homeland Security.\nQ: We are blessedly past the conventions. (Laughter.) Which also means that now it's time for transition work. I was hoping you could lay out a little bit about the degree of cooperation that this White House is engaged in with the Clinton and Trump camps.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, at the end of last week, the White House Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, placed telephone calls to designated officials on both campaigns to make them aware of the variety of resources that can be used to benefit their transition-planning activities.\nAnd the President made clear at the beginning of this year that one of his goals for the year, one of his top goals for this year was to ensure a smooth transition from the Obama administration to the next President. And President Obama has talked before about how this administration benefitted significantly from the effective planning of President George W. Bush's White House. And even though that transition took place across party lines, the effective coordination is something that benefitted the incoming President and the American people more generally. And the President aspires to meet, if not exceed, that very high standard that was set by the Bush White House.\nSo I do know that there is office space that the GSA has made available to the campaigns' respective transition teams. The much-discussed process of ensuring that the officials -- I'm sorry, that the candidates themselves receive an intel briefing from the Director of National Intelligence, that process is now available to the candidates. They have to schedule the timing of that briefing.\nAnd there also will be an opportunity for officials from the respective campaigns to now be a part firsthand of more official discussions about the transition-planning process that will include a wide variety of government officials.\nSo we can get you some more details on those kinds of meetings. But this process has been initiated by the President because the President has made it a priority to ensure a smooth transition to the next President.\nQ: Last one. Does the President's finding that Trump is unfit for office have any impact on transition, intelligence briefings, any other kind of preparations for the possibility that he might win in November?\nMR. EARNEST: No. The fact is, this administration is committed to working both effectively with the Democratic nominee and the Republican nominee to ensure that once the American people have made a decision about who should lead our country, that that transition can take place smoothly.\nRon.\nQ: That was my question. How can there be a smooth transition if the President thinks that Donald Trump is unfit? How can you -- there must be some overcompensation that has to happen in this transition relationship.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron --\nQ: If he's unfit, how can there be a smooth transition?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what we're planning for right now, Ron, is we're planning for a smooth transition. And that's the responsible step that you would expect the Commander-in-Chief to undertake. And the President is committed to engaging in that process across party lines in the same way that his predecessor did.\nQ: So is there like additional staff that's -- you understand the logic of this? If you think that the other party can't do this job, then how can you possibly work with them to transition into something that you don't think he can do?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, right now, Ron, we're not planning to transition with them. We are planning for a transition. And we are incorporating both campaigns into that process.\nThe kind of question that you're asking is a legitimate one, but I think is one that probably is more relevant once the American people have decided who the next President should be.\nQ: On the Iran thing, you kept referring to how much money -- how much money has Iran received in sanctions relief?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of the latest assessment that has been made about this. What I do know is that there had been predictions prior to the commencement of the deal from critics who suggested that Iran could get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. That's false. They were wrong. And were they just informed or lying? You'd have to ask them.\nQ: Right. But again, you were giving a fairly -- you were giving an accounting that seemed based on something that -- X went to debt relief and infrastructure, and so on and so forth. So how much went to -- how much didn't go to terrorism, and how much did go to terrorism if you have this accounting of -- if you're so confident that you know that the money primarily went to debt relief and infrastructure, and so on and so forth?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I was actually citing the comments of the Director of the CIA. So you can certainly check the intelligence community or the Treasury Department for a specific number.\nQ: So the point is, you don't know how much they've gotten in sanctions relief or really where it's gone.\nMR. EARNEST: I think, Ron, the point is right now that we do know how Iran has spent a lot of that money. And the amount of money that Iran has received is far less than what critics predicted. So they were either wrong or lying. You can go ask them.\nWhat we do know is that Iran was quite concerned about the state of their economy. That was the whole strategy that we put in place from the start. We recognized that the international community was fractured over how to deal and confront Iran and their growing nuclear aspirations. So the United States demonstrated some leadership. President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and other people had to represent the United States, get the international community to agree to apply significant pressure to Iran and their economy. The strategy worked. Iran's economy struggled. The value of their currency plummeted. They went into a recession because we were able to coordinate with the rest of the international community to apply this pressure. So Iran was desperate for sanctions relief so that they could address this economic weakness in their country.\nAnd we know that they used this money to invest in infrastructure, to try to pay off their economic debts that they were saddled with, and to try to shore up the value of their plummeting currency.\nQ: So the administration is not concerned about the amount of money that Iran has spent to finance terrorism post-Iranian -- post-nuclear deal?\nMR. EARNEST: Pre-Iranian nuclear deal, the President made clear that we continue to be concerned about Iran's nefarious activities in the region. That's why the United States has deepened our coordination with our allies and partners in the Middle East. To counter Iran's destabilizing activities, we've beefed up and strengthened our interdiction efforts to prevent Iran from being able to expand on their ballistic missile program. We've sought to deepen our cooperation even further with Israel because we know how Iran seeks to menace our closest ally in the Middle East. So we've acknowledged on the front end that we continue to be concerned with Iran's nefarious activities.\nThe other thing that was pointed out to me today -- and I'd actually forgotten this -- the day after, or two days after this agreement was announced, that weekend in January, later that week, the United States announced additional sanctions against Iran because of their ballistic missile program, as I recall. So we've been serious from the beginning about making sure that we are taking appropriate steps to counter Iran's various nefarious activities.\nQ: On the $400 million that was the tribunal settlement -- the whole amount, as I recall, was $1.7 billion.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: Where's the other $1.3 billion now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that $1.3 billion is essentially what was subject to negotiation in terms of how much interest accrued on this money. So that is why I make the case to you -- and other senior administration officials have done the same, including back in January -- that the American people saved potentially billions of dollars because of this smart deal that was reached.\nQ: Right -- the estimate was $10 billion or something, as I recall, that the United States could have been liable for. But the question is, where is the $1.3 billion, less the $400 million, that's already -- has the rest of it already gone to Iran, as well?\nMR. EARNEST: You have to check with the Treasury Department in terms of whether or not that other payment has been made.\nQ: But that's significant, isn't it? Why can't the administration be more transparent about -- and this is the concern raised by the reporting about the pallet and the cash. So why --\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I don't know how much more transparent the President of the United States can be than to call all of you into the Roosevelt Room, I believe it was, on live national television, and announce the fact that we have reached an agreement with Iran. I don't know how much more transparent we can be than to have the Secretary of State of the United States on January 17th issue a standalone written statement that's headlined, \"Hague Claims Tribunal Settlement.\" It's seven paragraphs long and it explains exactly the deal that was reached. So we have been quite forward-leaning in terms of explaining to the American people how they benefitted from this agreement.\nQ: So has Iran received the rest of this more than a billion dollars or not?\nMR. EARNEST: You need to check with the Treasury Department in terms of how these transactions are conducted. What I can tell you, Ron, is that when the United States makes an agreement and we make a commitment to make a payment, we're good to our word.\nQ: And the other thing on Iran, how many American citizens are now in Iran -- Iranian custody, post Iran nuclear deal? Because the reporting and the suggestion from the Iranian media base -- some of it, in reading that -- is that this is happening because a ransom was paid, because there was this coincidence.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, to be clear, I never called it a coincidence. We confronted that before.\nQ: Yeah, the question is -- there are other Americans who are now being held prisoner by Iran. What is the administration doing about that? And do you see a connection to the Iran deal from January?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are a couple of things here. The first is that I'm not in a position to talk publicly about the cases of individual Americans if they have not signed a privacy waiver. So we protect the privacy rights of American citizens around the world. So I'm quite limited in what I can say about this.\nWhat's also true is that in discussing the cases of Americans who are unjustly detained or being held hostage, we have often found that it is not helpful to name them, to detail them, to identify them specifically. So let me just say that we have continuing, longstanding concerns with Iran's treatment of American citizens in Iran. And that is why an agreement -- again, announced back in January -- that prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, that reached a financial settlement to save the American people potentially billions of dollars, and secure the release of five Americans that had been unjustly detained in Iraq was hailed as such a positive, beneficial outcome for the United States. But let me be clear: The United States does not pay ransoms. The only person that's making that accusation, at least included in The Wall Street Journal story that we're talking about, is some Iranian official.\nQ: No, it's actually Paul Ryan is doing it now and --\nQ: Marco Rubio --\nMR. EARNEST: They are now. So it sounds to me like they are once again in a position where they're making the same argument as hardliners in Iran in an effort to undermine the Iran nuclear agreement. The President made clear a year ago that right-wingers in the United States were making common cause with right-wingers in the Iranian government. And, again, if they're doing it again to try to justify their opposition to an agreement that has benefitted the American people, they can do that, but I think that's going to be pretty hard for them to explain. Maybe there's another letter from Senator Cotton to the Supreme Leader we don't know about.\nQ: Just this last -- can you confirm or deny that the money arrived the day that the Americans left?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't confirm the details of the specific transaction.\nQ: And you can't say anything about the remaining balance of this hundreds of millions of dollars that the United States has agreed to pay to settle the tribunal issue?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can -- I can't provide a specific update for you in terms of the transaction. I can tell you when the United States makes a commitment, we're good for our word and we live up to the terms of the agreement that we signed onto.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, I think a lot of us reported on that transfer at the time -- $400 million to the Iranian account, $1.3 from taxpayers, coming from the Treasury. But in terms of the logistics of this, there are some in Congress, including Ed Royce who has written an exchange letter to the State Department asking for more granularity on that.\nMR. EARNEST: A vowed opponent of the Iran deal continuing to try to justify his opposition to this agreement.\nQ: But as you would say, these are actually three separate deals. This isn't about the nuclear report, this isn't about prisoners, you're arguing; this is its own deal. So if we put those two aside and we just focus on this deal, specifically with the money transfer, will you be providing that detail to Congress, knowing that you can't tell us from the podium, as you just said?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, we'll continue to engage with members of Congress about this. I think what is true -- and I think would certainly account for the descriptions that were included in the newspaper today -- is that the United States does not have a banking relationship with Iran. And the reason for that is because of this administration's commitment to ensuring that we continue to hold Iran accountable for a variety of activities that we are deeply concerned about.\nQ: So that's logical in terms of not refuting the idea that it had to be a cash payment since there weren't any banking accounts, and that now that the banking system is a little less clogged, you could find other ways to pay, so maybe the timing suggests once again it's around the same time. Do you understand that -- I'm sure you appreciate that without the clarity on this, the innuendo and the optics make it tough, so to truly kill that idea and the allegations being made of a ransom payment. So why not provide that detail of exactly how the money was received?\nMR. EARNEST: I actually don't think that there's a lot of rationality in the argument that you've outlined that is being made by hard right-wing officials in Iran and Republican critics of the deal.\nQ: That taxpayers don't need to know how the $1.3 billion of their money was --\nMR. EARNEST: No, no, no. No, no, no. I'm talking about as it relates to this suggestion that somehow this was a ransom payment, that this is somehow connected to other elements of the deal. The only people who are making that suggestion are right-wingers in Iran who don't like the deal, and Republicans in the United States that don't like the deal.\nQ: But it would be very easy for you to kill that argument by saying this is exactly how it happened and why -- not just \"trust us, there's nothing shady about a plane arriving in the middle of the night loaded with cash\" -- which you're saying innuendo, right? You're saying there's nothing that was done that was not above board. So why not --\nMR. EARNEST: I think, Margaret -- I guess the point that I'm trying to make, Margaret, is we could not possibly have been more transparent about this arrangement than to have the President of the United States announce it to all of you on live national television on the day that the agreement was reached.\nQ: The day the agreement was reached and intent to pay the $1.7 billion, yes. But the details -- you're saying yourself it's new detail and an old story. I guess clarifying the detail is what would help clarify it.\nMR. EARNEST: But why is that relevant? Why is that relevant? Particularly when we all know that there's no banking relationship between the United States and Iran. So again --\nQ: You're talking about the cash transfer --\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I understand -- again, I understand the political attacks that are being made by people who are trying to justify their opposition to our engagement with Iran.\nQ: But at a minimum, the $1.3 billion is taxpayer money. So don't people have a right to have an answer to that question?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, that's why we announced it, as you point out, back in January.\nQ: But the details of that.\nMR. EARNEST: And what are the details?\nQ: Those transfers from the trust fund to this bank, to this bank, or it had to be in euros and francs because we don't have a banking relationship because it's complicated. Like, that would be a really simple thing that people would be able to follow.\nMR. EARNEST: So, look, I guess none of what you have walked through changes the basic facts there. We acknowledged, again, back on January 17th, that there would be all kinds of innuendo hurled by people who oppose engagement with Iran -- Republicans in the United States who oppose engagement with Iran. I recognize that the details that you're seeking to elicit might make for a colorful news story, but they don't change the facts. They don't actually change any sort of innuendo that's going to be lobbed by critics of the deal about our intent. They certainly are not going to effectively convince, again, a right-winger in Iran who's seeking some kind of propaganda victory in the pages of The Wall Street Journal from basically making a false claim that this somehow is a ransom payment.\nWhat I can tell you is that the United States, when we make an agreement, we live up to it. We announced the terms of this agreement back in January. The reason we announced the terms of the agreement in part is because we have a desire to be transparent with the American people. We also have a desire to advocate for the fact that because of this smart agreement, the American people potentially saved billions of dollars.\nQ: So you say this is completely politically motivated?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, the facts of this case, the facts of this situation and the benefits of this situation have been known for more than six months now. You all have been reporting on it for more than six months ago -- again, not because of some secret anonymous leak in the bowels of some government bureaucracy, but because the United States of America announced it on live television from the White House.\nQ: I know we've all been covering it. But the thing that's new is the detail that you're saying is irrelevant. And that's why it becomes a sticking point in the conflict.\nMR. EARNEST: I recognize it's my job to answer that questions up here, but I will acknowledge I don't understand -- other than for the fact that it makes for a colorful lead, I'll concede that -- but it's doesn't change the facts of the situation. It doesn't change anybody's assessment about the motive of the United States whether or not this was wired from one particular U.S. government account to some Iranian government account, as opposed to delivered on pallets. That's not going to change the argument of Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio that they're opposed to the deal. It's not going to change the propaganda efforts of the --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, they're opposed --\nQ: You're linking them all.\nMR. EARNEST: Because they are.\nQ: But you're saying they're not linked.\nMR. EARNEST: Because they are. I'm saying, the argument that they're making -- that is false, that has been proven wrong time and time again -- is not going to change based on whether this was wired or delivered in paper currency. So that -- so I understand the interest in details for a more colorful story, but I don't understand what this does to the broader outlines of an argument that have been in place for six months now. Republicans have lost that argument, critics of the deal have lost this argument, because we have succeeded in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. We did succeed in securing the release of five Americans who were unjustly detained overseas in Iran. And we did succeed in saving the American taxpayers potentially billions of dollars by reaching a longstanding financial settlement with the Iranians over their money.\nQ: You're just arguing that it's all worth it, basically?\nMR. EARNEST: I think, again --\nQ: But the details don't matter on this, is what you're saying.\nMR. EARNEST: I have not been quoted saying that, and I wouldn't be quoted saying that. I think what I'm saying is, it doesn't change the contours of the argument. The argument that is being made by Republicans is they're struggling to justify their opposition to our engagement with Iran. They've lumped it all together. We have made clear time and time again that we capitalize on this opening with Iran to try to settle this variety of claims.\nAnd there is no disputing, despite the best efforts of right-wingers in Iran and right-wingers in the United States, that we have prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, they have rolled back key aspects of their program, we did secure the release of five Americans, and we have settled a longstanding financial claim in a way that benefits the American people, potentially saving billions of dollars.\nQ: And lastly, nothing like this will happen to secure the release of the four Americans that are U.S. residents who some of their families have said are being held in Iran and the Iranians have said they're being held? I know you can't talk to those specific cases.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I will say is that the United States, under President Obama, has not paid a ransom to secure the release of Americans unjustly detained in Iran, and we're not going to pay a ransom. If there are Americans who are unjustly detained in Iran, we will make a case regularly through some now-established channels with Iran to advocate for their release.\nScott.\nQ: This financial dispute you mentioned has been going on for 35 years. Why was it necessary to airlift in the pallets of cash on the very weekend that the American prisoners were released?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, Scott, the reason is simple. The United States does not have a banking relationship with Iran. So --\nQ: That explains that it was cash, but it doesn't explain the timing.\nMR. EARNEST: Because we reached the agreement and Iran wanted their money back. So, again --\nQ: They waited 35 years.\nMR. EARNEST: Right, so you might expect that they would be eager for them to get their money back. Again, this all stems from a payment that Iran had made into a U.S. account related to a military sale that didn't actually go through. The military equipment wasn't provided. So, again, you could understand why they're quite eager for the money.\nYou also would understand that they're quite eager for the money when you consider that the value of their currency has plummeted, that they haven't been able to invest in infrastructure, that they've got debts that need to be paid, and that they're in the middle of a recession. So at the time, they were eager to try to address the legitimate concerns of the Iranian people about the state of the Iranian economy.\nQ: And why was the U.S. government so eager to pay --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: Why was the U.S. eager to deliver the money so quickly?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I would not describe the United States as eager -- I would describe the Iranians as eager. I think what the United States is, is we're a country that lives up to the commitments that we make. And that's exactly what we did.\nMichelle.\nQ: So it's been called a ransom payment by Iran. That's not exactly surprising. But would those prisoners have been released had this payment not been made at the time that it was? And so it isn't essentially a ransom payment then, even if the U.S. does not view it that way?\nMR. EARNEST: No. It is not a ransom payment. The United States does not view it that way, and it's not accurate to describe it that way.\nQ: So would those prisoners have been released then if this money hadn't been paid then?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think what is true is that there were a team of negotiators -- let me just start from the beginning. What I know is true is there were a team of negotiators in the United States that were interacting with Iranian officials to secure the release of five Americans who were unjustly detained in Iran. That negotiating work was successful and those Americans are at home.\nThere was a separate group of negotiators who were working through The Hague process for decades to try to reach an agreement, a settlement, on these financial claims. And there was momentum in our relationship where we were closing out accounts, where we were resolving longstanding concerns. And in each case, the United States reached agreements and closed out accounts in a way that benefitted the American people. And whether that is preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon or rolling back key aspects of their nuclear program or securing the release of five American citizens who were unjustly detained there, or reaching an agreement on a longstanding financial claim made by the Iranians about Iranian money in a way that saved the United States taxpayers potentially billions of dollars -- there are a lot of benefits to this deal. And we talked about them back in January with a lot of transparency. You all reported on it. And, again, the motive of people who want to talk about it again seems to be to just drum up innuendo in an effort to cover up the benefits of all of these agreements.\nQ: I think a lot more people find this interesting than just people who are opposed to it. But, again, would those prisoners have been released then if this money had not been paid then?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you is that our negotiators who were talking with the Iranians about what was necessary to secure the release of American citizens in Iran succeeded. That was different than the group of negotiators who were involved in The Hague negotiating with their Iranian counterparts to settle these longstanding financial claims.\nQ: So because U.S. policy is opposed to ransom payments, even if it were only for the appearance of this not being a ransom payment, why would you not have made Iran wait even a week longer? I mean, why would Iran's eagerness to get their hands on their money be more important than making sure that this was not a quid pro quo that was based on the exact timing being right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the answer to that is pretty obvious, which is that even a week delay would not have prevented Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio from falsely claiming that they're a ransom. Because, Michelle, come on, I saw you sigh. If we announced this financial settlement on the same day that the prisoners were released, that's fodder to our Republican critics. I get that.\nQ: But everything is fodder.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, exactly. I couldn't have said it better myself. (Laughter.)\nQ: No one is questioning that. It's an election coming up.\nMR. EARNEST: That's fine.\nQ: It works both ways.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think it works both ways.\nQ: But it was a pretty simple question. Would those prisoners have been released --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just say one thing about this --\nQ: -- if the money wasn't paid on that same weekend?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I guess what I'm saying is it's a pretty simple negotiation that took place, which is you had a group of negotiators who are interacting with their Iranian counterparts to secure the release of five American citizens. It is a different group of negotiators who are involved in trying to reach this settlement at The Hague. I think at some point the premise of your question is predicated on a decision that was made by Iranian officials. So I guess I would wish you the best of luck in trying to get an answer from them about what decision that they would have made.\nLet me tell you one other thing, though, as it relates to sort of waiting a week. It certainly wouldn't have prevented Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio from falsely accusing us of paying a ransom. But here's the other key thing. It also would not have prevented right-wingers in Iran from falsely seeking a propaganda victory by making the same argument. So that's why -- again, to go back to Margaret's line of questioning --\nQ: We already said none of that is any surprise.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. None of it is a surprise but it also is a good illustration I think of how the outlines of this argument haven't changed in six months. So there may be some more details that make for good newspaper copy, but they don't change the facts of this situation and they don't change the rationale for the argument that we have been making about the variety of ways in which the American people have benefitted from this series of agreements.\nQ: There's no harm in putting second eyes on something when some new detail has put it back in the public view. I mean, nobody is questioning that anything really has changed. It's just, you know, why not ask again? There's no harm in that. Anyway, just quickly --\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't stood up here and said that you guys shouldn't be asking the questions that you are. I welcome the opportunity to talk about all of the ways in which the American people have benefitted from our interactions with Iran. I think what I do take some umbrage at is the suggestion that somehow this is new evidence that proves that a ransom was paid. That's false. It was false when that accusation was made in January, it is false when that accusation is made in August, and it is false when that accusation is made in light of facts that don't change the calculation, either on the part of the President or anybody else who has a view on this matter.\nQ: How helpful would you say Iran has been in determining where Robert Levinson is?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't have an update for you in terms of the conversations that we've had with the Iranians about that. What we have indicated, as a part of that agreement that secured the release of five Americans who were unjustly detained in Iran, is Iran made a specific commitment to cooperate with our efforts and to share information with the United States that could potentially lead to the rescue of Mr. Levinson. But I'm not able to speak to the status of those ongoing talks.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Despite the sharpening of my axe for a while, to dive into that topic everybody else has pretty much touched on it, so I'm going to switch gears a little bit and talk Russia. (Laughter.) You guys did a great, job by the way. Thank God, right?\nThe President mentioned a tough relationship, obviously, with Russia and in particular with President Putin. I'm just wondering, how concerned is the White House, sort of to follow up on an earlier question, about the possibility of Russian hacking impacting not just our election but more broadly our infrastructure?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the United States has been concerned for some time about Russia's nefarious activities in cyberspace. And Director Clapper discussed this in his -- the Worldwide Threat Assessment that he delivered to Congress earlier this year. He said, \"Russia is assuming a more assertive cyber posture based on its willingness to target critical infrastructure systems and conduct espionage operations, even when detected and under increased public scrutiny.\" Secretary Carter has talked about Russia's nefarious activities in cyberspace as well. He noted that earlier this year, the censors that guard DOD's unclassified networks detected Russian hackers accessing one of our networks. And you've heard Lisa Monaco, who is the President's top counterterrorism advisor and somebody who is focused on homeland security, talk about how cognizant the Obama administration and the U.S. government is of Russia's activities in cyberspace.\nWe understand that there is a risk, a threat that Russia poses in cyberspace, and this is something that we have raised with them in a variety of channels and we've made clear that we have some concerns. So there are a variety of things that we have done in response. We haven't just raised it with Russian officials. The President more than a year ago designated additional authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to allow him to impose financial sanctions against entities or individuals who are involved in hacking in cyberspace. That is a capability that the U.S. government didn't previously have, but it is something that we have used before and could potentially be used in preparing a proportional response to cyber threats.\nThe other thing that we have worked to do is to work with the rest of the international community, including through the G20, to try to arrange the international community around a set of international norms. And the President made reference to this in his comments yesterday that innovation in cyberspace and development of capabilities in cyberspace has outstripped the international community's ability to establish rules of the road and norms when it comes to appropriate conduct in cyberspace. And so we need to do the important work of building international momentum around agreeing to those kinds of norms. That will help us and be effective in enforcing those norms and holding people accountable for violating them.\nQ: When the President has a conversation with Vladimir Putin or other leaders and you say that he'll have an exchange -- and he even said yesterday, he said, add to the laundry list, effectively, of the problems of disagreements that I might have -- does he get specific about if you do X, or if you continue to do X, we will be forced to do Y? And I ask the question because people wonder often, when he'll make a comment and he'll say, you know, we have raised that with our counterparts or we've discussed this with our counterparts -- they are always looking for more meat on the bone in that respect. You kind of touched on it a bit. Can you expand on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any additional insight to shed on private conversations between the U.S. President and the President of Russia. But I do think I can faithfully tell you that the President has been very direct and other U.S. officials have been very direct in talking to their high-level Russian counterparts about our concerns about Russian activities in cyberspace. Those are well-known.\nThose concerns are well-known, their activities are something that have been well-documented. Their capabilities are something that U.S. officials have been talking about publically for quite some time. So the Russians are well aware of our concern, and they're well aware of our capability when it comes to potential responses.\nBut just to make sure that people don't misinterpret what I said, I want to be clear that the FBI has not announced any specific conclusions about their investigation into the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. So I don't want any of this conversation to be construed as applying to that specific case. Our discussion relates to our broader concerns about Russia's activities in cyberspace, and they're not commenting with regard to one specific case.\nQ: And the last thing -- I guess I can take maybe a small swing at it -- would you at least acknowledge the wince-some appearance going back to this payment -- the wince-some appearance of payment goes out, people who are held captive come home? Maybe it was just timing, granted, but would you at least acknowledge that it doesn't look great?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, if that was a legitimate concern, it is a concern that would have been raised six months ago when we originally announced it. That's why I'm quite skeptical of the integrity of the reaction that we've seen from people who have long been on the record of opposing our efforts to engage with Iran. And the fact is, despite their opposition and despite their criticism, we have succeeded in rolling back key aspects of Iran's nuclear program and preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and securing the release of five Americans who were unjustly detained in Iran, and settling a longstanding financial dispute in a way that potentially saves American taxpayers billions of dollars.\nQ: They keep plucking American -- Iranian Americans. Do we have any of their citizens?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not quite sure what you mean by saying \"have any of their citizens.\" There are any number of Iranian Americans in the United States.\nQ: I meant specifically they seem to be -- the government seems to be kidnapping Americans -- kidnapping Iranian Americans over there. Are we doing anything in response to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to any individual case for the reasons that I outlined earlier. What is true is that when there were Americans who we believed were unjustly detained in Iran, Secretary Kerry acknowledged when he was having daily meetings with his Iranian counterpart in the context of the negotiations to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. He raised U.S. concerns about that unjust attention every single day.\nSo this the status of Americans held against their will around the world is a top priority of the U.S. government, and there are significant efforts and significant resources that are committed to seeking the recovery of Americans who are unjustly held or held hostage around the world.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. If I can circle back to Iran briefly. Is it your contention that it is not a ransom payment because there was no quid pro quo or because it was Iranian money that was flown in?\nMR. EARNEST: It is our contention that there was no ransom paid to secure the release of U.S. citizens who were being unjustly detained in Iran because, A, it's against the policy of the U.S. government to pay ransoms. And that's something that we told the Iranians that we would not do. We would not -- we have not, we will not pay a ransom to secure the release of U.S. citizens. That's a fact. That is our policy and that is one that we have assiduously followed.\nQ: You said the timing -- you refused to describe this as a coincidence also. Regardless of whether this was a ransom, was the timing a concession to allow the Iranian regime to save face or to gain a symbolic propaganda victory? Was that something that factored into the U.S. calculation?\nMR. EARNEST: We talked about this calculation back in January. And what we said back in January -- I stood at this podium on January 19th and we talked about this. The timing is predicated on the ability to resolve a variety of concerns that we had with Iran. Iran was signing off on deals and we got them to sign off on a deal that released five Americans who were unjustly detained in Iran. We got them to sign off on a deal that rolled back key aspects of their nuclear program and prevents them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. We got them to sign off on a deal that would resolve longstanding financial concerns -- our longstanding financial dispute that, yes, that returned $400 million of Iranian money but that also saved U.S. taxpayers potentially billions in interest charges.\nSo all that came to a head at the same time because we were focused on capitalizing on this opportunity to complete these agreements. And the benefits of those agreements are quite difficult to argue with. I recognize it doesn't prevent our critics from trying to do so in a partisan, political way, but when it comes to our national security and when it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, when it comes to the safety of American citizens abroad, when it comes to saving taxpayers billions of dollars, those are the kinds of things that should rise above politics.\nQ: Switching topics. The President said in March at the South by Southwest Festival about voter registration online and online voting, he said: \"We can pay our taxes, we can hold up our phone at the supermarket to pay with our credit card, but somehow online voter registration is perceived to be insecure...\" Given that there is potential meddling by a foreign government in our election process, is it still his contention that online voter registration and voting does not raise significant concerns of the security of our elections?\nMR. EARNEST: I think you may be taking some editorial liberties with the President's comments there. I think the President's comment speaks very well for itself. The chief obstacle that we had seen to modernizing and making the voting registration and ballot casting process more efficient is Republicans who have no interest in making it easier for people to participate in our democracy. In fact, we actually see Republican intentionally erecting barriers to participation because somehow they believe that that allows them to enjoy a political benefit. That's rather disappointing.\nThe fact that banks have been hacked does not prevent anybody in this room from accessing their checking account online. The point is we place a high priority on addressing threats in cyberspace. And the risk associated with this is not a reason to remain in the 20th or 19th century when it comes to our voting system. It actually is an argument for a more robust and more technologically sophisticated investment in our voter registration and vote tabulating system. And we've made that case forcefully, and the President will continue to do so.\nQ: The administration's position on online voting and online voter registration is that it is something that should be looked at.\nMR. EARNEST: It is our view that there is a way for us to use technology to make it easier for eligible voters to register to vote and cast a ballot. And we should be trying to capitalize on technology that makes it easier for our citizens to participate in democracy. That certainly is true. There obviously are a number of technical questions that are raised. But we should confront those questions and we should address them because the President believes that our democracy is stronger when more people are able to participate. And if we make the process more efficient and more convenient, the President believes more people will.\nAndrew.\nQ: Josh, you mentioned that you told the Iranians that the U.S. government doesn't pay ransom. Did they ask for one?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not able to speak to any requests that were made the Iranian government. You can check with them. But if they were to have asked, the answer would have been no.\nQ: Okay, and on a different subject. North Korea fired two intermediate-range ballistic missiles yesterday, one of which landed in Japanese waters. Is there anything about the target of these launches or the proximity to them getting a nuclear-armed ballistic -- developing of a nuclear-armed ballistic missile that would change your calculus in how you approach this? As I understand it, you're going to go back to the U.N. and Pyongyang is going to ignore whatever sanctions come out of that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me go through the details here. The U.S. Strategic Command systems detected what we assess were two North Korean launches yesterday at about 7:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time. Initial indications reveal one of the missiles exploded immediately after launch, while the second was tracked over North Korea and into the Sea of Japan.\nThose are the details. You saw the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations announce today our intent to convene an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council with Japan to discuss this issue.\nWe continue to believe -- the United States continues to believe that our response to North Korea's destabilizing activities is stronger when the international community remains united. So that's why the United States continues to work so closely with our partners at the U.N., with our allies like Japan and South Korea, and with countries like Russia and China to try to counter this activity and try to urge, impress upon the North Korean government the need to stop these kinds of missile launches that are destabilizing to an already volatile region of the world.\nSo we continue to be concerned about this, but we continue to place a high priority on our effective coordination with the international community. In order to apply additional pressure on the North Korean government, we're going to need to work effectively with the Russians and the Chinese to get that done. And that's what we're committed to doing.\nQ: Final question. Do you have -- is there a public estimate about how long it will take before North Korea has a nuclear-armed ballistic missile?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of an updated intelligence assessment on this that's been presented. But let me see if there's some additional information that we can provide on this.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, three different subjects. Going back to Iran, what other options were on the table from the consideration of making this payment to fulfill your obligation and also in light of the recession that's happening in Iran? You said something about the week later. Were there other timelines on the table when you were trying to figure out how to make this payment?\nMR. EARNEST: The weeklong delay is a hypothetical that Michelle raised, and I think was a good illustration because it indicates that the logistics involved in this transaction don't at all change our desire to resolve a longstanding financial dispute with the Iranians that saves the American people potentially billions of dollars.\nSo I don't know what else was considered in terms of the logistics, but what I'm saying is that doesn't affect both our desire to resolve this dispute, it also doesn't affect the way in which the American people benefitted from the resolution of this dispute.\nQ: Next subject. Going back to something earlier in this briefing, Denis McDonough and the efforts for the transition for both campaigns for whomever is going to be President of the United States. How was Denis McDonough received from the Trump camp? This was days before President Obama said that Donald Trump was unfit. But we understand, everyone knows that there is disdain in both camps -- or maybe that might be too harsh a word -- there is no love lost between both sides. How was Denis received by the Trump camp?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that Denis was fulfilling a responsibility that President Obama had given to his team to prioritize planning for an effective transition come November. And so I can tell you that Denis fulfilled that responsibility seriously because the President has made it a priority. How the campaign's representative may have responded to that call, you'd have to ask them.\nQ: So you think he fulfilled -- there's a lot in that -- he fulfilled his responsibility. But was he able to adequately fulfill his responsibility? Was there a blockage? Did it go smoothly? Was he able to pick up the phone and meet right away? Could you give us a little tick-tock?\nMR. EARNEST: It was just a telephone call. And I'm not aware of any concerns that were raised by the call.\nQ: And lastly, not serious but significant. President Obama has his last birthday as President on the 4th, tomorrow. How is he spending his birthday as President -- the last birthday he has as President of the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, he'll be spending at least some of his birthday with all of you when he does a news conference tomorrow at the Pentagon after convening his National Security Council meeting to talk about our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nIf that's something he wanted to do for his birthday -- (laughter) -- is something you'll have to ask him tomorrow.\nQ: But if I recall, he had another press conference I think it was last year or the year before on his birthday. But let's go -- sorry, I digress a minute. So okay, that's for his birthday. But I'm talking about a party. I understand -- I hear that there's some big planning and some big names coming in for the President. Is that true?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates on how the President is planning to celebrate his birthday, but we'll keep you posted.\nQ: You don't have any updates, but you do know something, right?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any details at this point, but we'll keep you posted. All right?\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Earlier today, French President Hollande said that Donald Trump's \"excesses are both sickening.\" I'm wondering what's the President's reaction to that. And does the President feel that his comment about Trump being unfit for the presidency while sort of standing next to another world leader gives other world leaders an opening to speak out against Donald Trump, as we've seen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, other world leaders are going to make their own decisions about what they share with regard to their feelings about the U.S. presidential election. So we'll let them do that in the way that they believe is most appropriate.\nI'd just point out that President Obama's comments yesterday were in a response to a direct question that he received at a news conference standing next to the Prime Minister of Singapore.\nQ: Also part of his response was to say that sort of in 2008 and 2012 if McCain or Romney had won, that he'd be disappointed, but he would tell the American people this is the President and I believe this person will be able to uphold the Constitution. Was the implication there that if Donald Trump wins, that he won't be able to look at the American people in the eye and say, this is your President, and I think he'll be able to uphold the Constitution?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think -- I don't think the President was being particularly subtle about the doubts that he harbors.\nQ: I also wanted to ask about the DNC. A few people were let go there yesterday. Has the White House or the President been in touch with the DNC, with Donna Brazile? Is the White House satisfied with what you've seen so far in terms of the dismissals?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, as we discussed, I believe it was last week -- what the White House believes is that the leadership of the DNC should be closely coordinating their activities with the campaign apparatus with the individual who is at the top of the ticket in 2016. That person is not President Obama but rather Secretary Clinton.\nSo I'm confident that the White House has been in discussions with the DNC about some of their activities over there. But ultimately it's the responsibility of the Clinton campaign to effectively coordinate with the Democratic Party apparatus to integrate their efforts and focus on the upcoming election. So ultimately the question about the leadership of DNC is something that they'll resolve.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to go back to North Korea very quickly. And in an interview today, North Korea's top official dealing with the U.S. warns that relations between the U.S. and North Korea will be dealt with under wartime laws. And he specifically said that includes the detention of the two American prisoners who are being detained there. Does the U.S. have any word that these Americans are being mistreated or abused, or concern about their treatment going forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we obviously are concerned about the status of U.S. citizens that are unjustly detained in foreign countries, including in North Korea. And we've made the case to the North Korean government about appealing for their release. There are obviously specific channels through which we can do that because the United States does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea. But we certainly are making efforts to pursue the release of U.S. citizens that are being unjustly detained in North Korea.\nAs it relates to the rhetoric that we've heard from the North Koreans, I think it is in indicative of their destabilizing approach to the region. And U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea have encouraged North Korea to abandon that overheated rhetoric and those destabilizing activities. China and Russia have done the same. So ultimately, our case is strengthened, our hand in strengthened, in compelling the North Korean regime when we work effectively with the international community. And that's the reason that Ambassador Power will be working at an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to coordinate on an international response.\nQ: And on Zika really quickly, you said that Republicans need to act to pass funding. But since the outbreak in Florida has been announced, has the President made any personal outreach to congressional leadership to discuss this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, congressional leaders aren't in Washington, D.C. He can. I'm not aware of any specific conversations to tell you about right now. But I can tell you that the President has been on the phone with the governor of Florida to ensure that federal officials are coordinating effectively with state and local officials to make sure that we're mobilizing an effective response.\nRepublicans in Congress know everything they need to know to make a decision about whether or not they're going to fulfill their responsibility to do their part to protect the American people from the Zika virus. Thus far they haven't. And if they're going to change their approach, we hope they'll do it soon.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, tomorrow is the counter-ISIL meeting at the Pentagon. I realize this is one of the regular series the President has been having at the agencies. To what extent does this one have to do with the air campaign that's begun in Libya this week, in and around Sirte?\nMR. EARNEST: Mark, I can tell you that this meeting was scheduled before those airstrikes were conducted. But I'm confident that U.S. activities in Libya, at the invitation of the Libya government, will be a part of the briefing that the President receives, because it's an important part of our efforts to prevent ISIL from establishing a safe haven anywhere in the world.\nQ: How long is this campaign going to go on? Are we looking at days, weeks, months?\nMR. EARNEST: Are you talking about the situation in Libya? Or just --\nQ: The campaign in and around Sirte.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that the Department of Defense has put a timeline on it at this point. But obviously our activities in Libya are in support of a ground force that is acting on the orders of the Libyan government. And the actions that the United States has taken in Libya come at the request of the Libya government. And moving forward, all our activities in Libya will continue to be closely coordinated with the central government there. So I guess that's a long way of saying that the timeframe will certainly be dependent upon the preferences and requests that are put forward by the Libyan government.\nAndrei, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. I really appreciate it. I have a question about Pope Francis, what he said. But I'm a rare guest these days, so I'll ask a couple of things about Russia. Number one, you are concerned about -- Americans are held abroad. Are you aware that there are American prisoners in Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think you have to check with the State Department in terms of determining the case and determining what we can say publicly about this case.\nQ: Yeah, the question is -- there are a couple of Russians, at least, held in the U.S. who basically have been kidnapped, brought here from third countries. The Russians today -- I don't know why today -- mentioned that they offered a swap, a prisoner swap, to the Americans. They publicly said that. They hadn't said that before. Are you aware of that offer? And what in general -- what is your attitude to such ideas of prisoner swaps?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know what cases you're specifically referring to when you mention the Russian citizens there. I can confidently tell you that the U.S. government has not been involved in kidnapping any Russian citizens. I don't know who would make that kind of claim, but there's no evidence for it.\nQ: Viktor Bout and Yaroshenko, the pilot, Konstantin Yaroshenko, who were (inaudible) one in Thailand and the other in Liberia, brought over here and put on trial and put in American jails. Those are the two cases.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I would encourage you to check with the Department of Justice to get the facts on that case. It sounds like it might be worth you doing so.\nQ: Secondly, since you were talking about this campaign against ISIS, will we be bombing al Nusra together anytime soon? Because Secretary Kerry and Minister Lavrov seem to agree on this, but today at the Pentagon, they asked Peter Cook, and he basically there are -- no, I'm sorry it was not Cook, it was the General from the battlefield. He said that no preparation was being done in terms of intelligence. So will we be bombing al Nusra together?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Andrei, the case that we have made directly to the Russians is they should use their special influence with the Assad regime to enforce a cessation of hostilities to get back to a place where the Assad regime, with the support of the Russians, is not attacking innocent civilians. And that's not happened. And that is a violation of commitments that Russia made in the context of the Cessation of Hostilities. And that has prevented -- frankly, it's exacerbated a humanitarian situation because it has prevented an increase in humanitarian assistance that can be provided. It has exacerbated the political situation around the diplomatic talks that we've been working together to try to facilitate because opposition leaders don't want to come and sit at the negotiating table with the Assad regime as long as the Assad regime that's being aided and abetted by the Russian government is carrying out attacks against civilians that they supposedly represent.\nSo the truth is, the United States continues to be concerned both about the failure of Russia and the Assad regime to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the Cessation of Hostilities, but also about the continued presence and activities of extremist organizations inside of Syria. And we have said for quite some time that we would welcome Russia not using their military might to buck up the Assad regime, but rather to focus entirely on going after extremists. And if they were prepared to do that, the United States would be prepared and our coalition partners would be prepared to work more effectively with them. But thus far, Russia has refused to do that.\nSo the truth is -- the question right now is one that relates directly to the credibility of Russian leaders. Are they going to live up to the commitments that they've made? And if so, we can begin doing the important work of more effectively coordinating our efforts to go after extremists that we know threaten both our countries. And the continued efforts of the Russians to prop up the Assad regime only makes it easier for extremists in Syria who we know thrive on chaos to bolster their positions in that country.\nQ: I guess the Russians would say that the biggest priority is going after the extremists. Do you agree with that?\nMR. EARNEST: We certainly believe that the priorities should be placed on going after extremists. Unfortunately, the conduct of Russian military activities has been inconsistent with that claim; that Russian military activities have devoted significant time and attention and resources and energy to supporting the Assad regime, and to further --\nQ: Against who?\nMR. EARNEST: Against opposition fighters in Syria. The point is that the more that they do that --\nQ: The moderates.\nMR. EARNEST: Excuse me?\nQ: The moderate opposition fighters. But there are no moderate opposition fighters. That's the point.\nMR. EARNEST: The point is, Andrei, as long as the Russian military continues to buck up the Assad regime, it only foments greater chaos in Syria. It only makes a diplomatic resolution and a political transition, that President Putin himself said is necessary, farther off into the distance. And the farther off that political transition is in the distance, the more chaos there is in Syria in the near term. And that chaos is something that we know extremist organizations thrive upon.\nThat's why we believe that Russia should live up to the commitments that they have made, enforce the Cessation of Hostilities, not devote so much energy and attention to fortifying the Assad regime, and actually working more effectively with the international community to go after extremists. Once Russia has demonstrated a commitment to actually doing that, then I would be much more optimistic about the ability of the United States and Russia to work more effectively together inside of Syria.\nQ: And lastly, my general question about a very interesting comment that Pope Francis made. I don't know if you can answer it right away. If you take my question, I'm fine if you give me an answer later. Pope Francis basically said peace is lost -- which is striking. We all remember when -- and I'm not saying that it's like, I don't know, President Obama's fault, but we all remember that President Obama, when he was first elected, was immediately given this Nobel Peace Prize, which reflected at least like the hope of all the world that we'll have some peaceful future ahead of us. And now, at the end of the Obama presidency, the Pope says peace has been lost. And when we look at Europe, when we look at the Middle East, when we look at the United States, we cannot say that peace is here. So basically my question is, how do you explain that? Why has peace been lost on President Obama's watch?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I will say that I don't agree with the assessment in the way that you portrayed it. So I think I'd take a closer look at Pope Francis's comments and see if we can get you a response.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 1:14 P.M.

Thank you so much! Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Everybody, please sit down, sit down. Everybody, sit down.\nAudience members. Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!\nThe President. Thank you so much! Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.\nWell, it is so good to see all of you. Okay, everybody, settle down, settle down.\n[At this point, audience members sang \"Happy Birthday.\"]\nThe President. Yay! Thank you! Well, you know, I—let me first of all just say that—let me first of all say I'm a little disappointed with the lack of enthusiasm. [Laughter] Everybody is so shy and quiet. So—[laughter].\nI—first of all, I want to thank Emmanuel for the great introduction and the outstanding work on behalf of the people of Uganda. Please give Emmanuel a big round of applause. I don't know whether they chose Emmanuel because he's such a great speaker, which he is—[laughter]—or because they thought he and I were cousins. [Laughter] Because Odama, Obama—[laughter]—there must be some connection.\nNow, I know that you've been in this fellowship for a few weeks. I know that for many of you, this is your first visit to the United States. So let me start by saying, on behalf of the American people, welcome to the United States.\nI don't want to give a long speech, because I'm really here to hear from you and answer your questions and to get your comments and ideas. But I do want to just take a moment to step back and talk about why you being here is so important, not just to me, but to all of our countries and to people around the world.\nI stand here as the President of the United States and the son of an African. Michelle and I have always tried to instill in our girls, our daughters, a sense of their heritage—which is American and African and European—with all the strengths and all the struggles of that heritage. We took them to Africa. We wanted to open their eyes to the amazing tapestry of history and culture and music. We looked out from those Doors of No Return. We stood in the cell where Mandela refused to break.\nAnd as President, I've now visited sub-Saharan Africa four times, which is more than any other U.S. President. And even as Africa continues to face enormous challenges: poverty and disease and conflict, I see a continent on the move. You have one of the world's fastest growing regions, home to a middle class that is projected to grow to over 1 billion consumers. You are more connected by technology and smartphones than ever before as I can see here today. [Laughter] Africa is sending more of its children to school. You're saving more lives from HIV/AIDS and infant mortality. And while there's still more work to do to address these challenges, today's Africa is a place of unprecedented prosperity and opportunity.\nSo, over the past 7½ years, I've worked to transform America's relationship with Africa so that we are equal partners. As so many Africans have told me, you want trade not aid, trade that supports jobs and growth. So we've been working to boost exports with Africa. We're working to promote good governance and human rights, to advance security, to help feed families.\nEarlier today I signed a new Executive order so that we're doing even more to support American companies that are interested in doing business in Africa. And this fall, we'll host the second U.S.-Africa Business Forum to encourage more trade and investment. And we're going to keep working together in our Power Africa initiative to bring cleaner electricity to more than 60 million African homes and businesses.\nAnd we're doing this not just because I love the people of Africa, but also because the world will not be able to deal with climate change or terrorism or expanding women's rights—all the issues that we face globally—without a rising and dynamic and self-reliant Africa, and that, more importantly than anything else, depends on a rising generation of new leaders. It depends on you.\nThat's why 6 years ago I launched the Young African Leaders Initiative, because I've always believed that one person can be a force for positive change. That one person, as Bobby Kennedy famously said when he visited Soweto—that one person can be like a stone, a pebble thrown in a lake, creating ripples. Ripples of hope, he called it. And that's especially true for all of you. You're young, you're talented, optimistic. You're already showing you can make a difference. So what we wanted to do through YALI is to connect you with each other and to resources and to networks that can help you become the leaders in business and government and civil society of tomorrow.\nAnd the response has been overwhelming. Across Africa, more than 250,000 people have joined our YALI network. They get access to online courses. They have a network of peers and mentors across Africa and across the globe. We've issued nearly 150,000 certificates from those courses. I might, when I have a little more time, maybe teach one of those courses myself. The—[applause]. Right now I'm kind of busy, but—[laughter]. We're training thousands of young people in leadership and entrepreneurship and networking at our four regional leadership centers in Dakar, Accra, Nairobi, and Pretoria.\nAnd today I'm proud to welcome all of you, the third class of Mandela Fellows. More than 40,000 people applied. You're our biggest class yet—double the size of the previous year—1,000 YALI Fellows strong. And for the last 6 weeks, you've been studying and learning at some of America's best universities. Today you're not just Mandela Fellows, but you're also Hawkeyes and Buckeyes and Sun Devils. We've got some Fighting Irish here. We've got our first class of Energy Fellows, young people at UC Davis studying new ways to promote clean energy and fight climate change.\nAnd not only have you've been studying and learning, but you've also immersed yourself in American culture. You've looked at sites from our Nation's founding in Boston and Philadelphia. You've visited the 9/11 Memorial in New York. You've spent time in my hometown of Chicago. So you've got a taste of America, which for some of you apparently included something called lobster ice cream, which I've never tasted myself, but, I have to admit, sounds terrible. [Laughter] But that's okay. You were very brave. [Laughter]\nYou've also gotten a front row seat on the fascinating roller-coaster process of American democracy because you're here during election season. And I hope you've buckled your seatbelts—[laughter]—but it actually has been a good lesson and a reminder, democracy is hard everywhere, even in the world's oldest continuous democracy. It's always challenging, and it is always messy. But as you're watching our election, I want you to know that one of the things that leaders in Washington agree on, on both sides of the political aisle—Republicans and Democrats—is the importance of a strong American partnership with the nations and peoples of Africa. That's true today. I'm confident it will be true for years to come.\nSo we're going to keep standing with you. America is going to keep standing with activists like Geline Fuko of Tanzania. All right? Geline is a lawyer and human rights activist. A few years ago, she thought people in Tanzania should be able to use their mobile phones to read their Constitution, so she went out and designed Tanzania's first—[applause]—she designed Tanzania's first database of constitutional resources, opening up her Government to more of her people so they could understand their law and their rights and their responsibilities. So thank you so much, Geline, for the great work.\nWe're going to keep standing with social entrepreneurs like Awa Caba of Senegal. [Applause] Whoa! Where is Awa? Where, where? You're over here.\nSo who was this guy who jumped up? [Laughter] He's what you call your hype man. [Laughter] He was hyping you up. [Laughter]\nSo Awa cofounded a tech hub to offer free training for women in coding and IT skills. And she also started an e-commerce platform to help Senegalese women take their products, whether it's cosmetics or fruits or jams, to the market and to the world. Because Awa knows that when our women succeed, our countries succeed. So thank you, Awa, for the good work.\nWe're going to keep standing with strivers like Mamba Francisco of Angola. Where's Mamba?\nMamba is his own hype man. [Laughter] So, 2 years ago, he wanted to be a Mandela Fellow, but he didn't qualify because he didn't speak English. So he buckled down, he studied, he learned. And he's here today helping other young people from Angola read and write and make it to college. So thank you. Good job.\nAnd finally, we'll stand together in memory of John Paul Usman. As many of you know, John Paul was a bright young leader from Nigeria who inspired people around the world with his work for peace. Tragically, he lost his life earlier this summer in a hiking accident, and I know you're showing solidarity with the green ribbons that some of you are wearing. Like you, I have faith that John Paul's legacy of building peace and fighting for children's rights will live on, not just in Nigeria, but in all those he inspired in your countries back home and here in the United States.\nBecause this is a two-way street. For all the experiences that you're gaining here in the United States, we're learning from you. We're energized by your passion. We're learning from your perspectives. And that's why this year for the first time, Americans travel to Africa to visit Mandela Fellows in their home communities so that Americans can learn about development and community building and more from Africans. And even more Americans will participate in this exchange next year. It's also why I'm excited to announce new support from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the U.S. African Development Foundation, and the Citi Foundation to provide even more Africans with grants and professional opportunities. Give them a big round of applause for their support.\nSo these partnerships don't just change the lives of young people like you, they're also energizing our countries and shaping our world. We've created programs like this not just in Africa, but in Southeast Asia, in the Americas, in Europe. So you're a part of a huge and growing network of the next generation of leaders around the world. And while I'm going to leave it up to historians to decide my overall legacy—[laughter]—one of the things that I'm really proud of is my partnership with young people like you, because all of you inspire me.\nSo years from now when you're running a big business or doing a great nonprofit or leading your country as a President or a Prime Minister or a Minister of Finance or something, my hope is that you can look back and you will keep drawing from the strength and the experience that you've gotten here.\nI hope that you'll remember those of us who believed in your potential. And I hope, as a consequence, you then give back to the people who are coming up behind you, because that's how we keep making progress together across oceans and across generations. So, as you do that, you should know that you'll always have a partner and friend in the United States of America. I could not be prouder of all of you and the great work that you've done.\nI want to once again thank our outstanding institutions, our universities that have been hosting you. We're very, very proud of their great work.\nAnd so with that, now what I want to do is open it up for questions. I know that some people are watching on the YALI network online. So hello, everybody. Over the past week, they've been sending in questions over Facebook, so we're actually going to start with one of those. And we've got a YALI alum here to read our first question, Steve Zita. Where are you, Steve? There you are. You're going to read our first question. Go ahead, Steve.\nCulture+ Cofounder Steve Mbuku Zita. Thank you very much, sir. By the way, you just said that people might wonder if you and Emmanuel were cousins. I just wanted to say that in this room, we're all brothers. And you're one of us.\nThe President. Although, I have to say that at this point, I'm probably an uncle. [Laughter] I wish I could say I was a brother or a cousin, but now I've got some gray hair. [Laughter] So you got to call me Uncle.\nGo ahead.\n2008-2009 Recession/Syria/South Sudan/Terrorism\nMr. Zita. Yes, sir. So thank you very much. I'm Steve Zita from DRC. I'm a 2015 alum. I was at the University of Texas at Austin. [Applause] There they are.\nAnd as you know, the YALI network is a huge pool of about 250,000 people. So we couldn't all be here. Unfortunately, I think we might not fit in the room.\nAnd our first question comes from Charles Stembo, from Zambia, who wanted to know, \"What has been the most challenging issue you've had to handle since you've become President of the United States? And also, what will be your last message as a President, of course, to the young people across the globe?\"\nThe President. Well, I've had my share of tough issues. The issue that had the greatest magnitude was the issue I faced when I first came into office, and that was that the world economy was in the midst of an unprecedented financial crisis that was then spilling over into the broader economy. And the growth and trade and the entire financial system was contracting at a pace that we hadn't seen since the 1930s, since the Great Depression.\nAnd so the series of actions that we had to take very quickly—to strengthen our banks, to coordinate internationally to unlock the financial system, to make sure that people did not engage in protectionist behavior, to resuscitate our auto industry, to put people back to work, to make sure that we didn't get a further downward spiral, to stabilize the housing market here—that was important not just for the United States, but that was important internationally because we're such a big engine for economic growth. And we're still suffering from some of the scars from that great recession that we had in 2007, 2008. But overall, we averted the worst of the crisis, and we were able to stabilize the situation so that the world could start growing again. And that means jobs and opportunity and prosperity for a lot of people.\nProbably, the most frustrating challenge that I've had on an ongoing basis typically involves conflicts outside of the United States. Syria is the toughest example. But the conflicts that we continue to see in South Sudan, for example, where after years of fighting and millions of people dead, finally, there was the opportunity to create an independent country of South Sudan. And yet now, within South Sudan, there is still conflict between the two countries—or between two factions. Those are very challenging, because the United States, on the one hand, cannot police and govern every spot in the world. On the other hand, people look to us to have a positive influence. And when—and our goal has been consistently to try to bring people together so that they can sit down and resolve issues politically rather than through violence.\nIt is a source of ongoing, daily frustration for me that we have not been able to stop some of these conflicts. One of the things that we've seen in the world today is a shift. It used to be that you had these big wars between great powers. Now, so often, the greatest suffering arises out of either ethnic conflict or sectarian conflict or states that are unstable. And the consequences for ordinary people in those countries are enormous. And in some ways, it's harder to stop those kinds of conflicts than it is simply to defeat an army that is clearly identified.\nAnd the challenge of terrorist networks, which is been an ongoing project of ours and many of our partners around the world is tied up with this issue. Because when you have regional conflicts and young people are displaced and they are without education and they are without prospects and they're without hope, then the possibilities of them being recruited into an organization like ISIL or Al Qaida or Boko Haram, even if it's just a tiny, small percentage, is obviously going to be higher than if people are given opportunity and there's stability in their lives.\nSo the one thing that I know is that the way we're going to solve these problems is not in isolation, but by having people of good will from across regions, across continents working together. And that begins with many of the young people like you around the world who are trying to do the right thing. So, good. All right, next.\nOh, by the way, I always go boy, girl, boy, girl here to make sure things are equal. [Laughter] That was a young man who asked that question, right? So it's a lady's turn. Go ahead, right there. [Laughter] Here, you've got a microphone.\nSudan/Human Rights\nQ. Hi, thank you for the chance, Mr. President of the United States. Okay. [Laughter] I work in international advocacy.\nThe President. What's your name?\nQ. My name is Samreen Alkhair. I'm from Sudan. I'm a cofounder of something called the Sudanese Human Rights Initiative. I go work in international advocacy a lot, and we meet representatives from your Government, and they play a big role influencing the resolutions that come—[inaudible]—in Sudan, which part they will be. So I really want to understand how the United States stands, because we have sanctions, and sometimes, I feel they're not enough. So I want to see in the international relations what the situation of the United States and how can they help to empower young people like us and to be heard and to be in roundtables to help and developing democracy in the country. And that's the—[inaudible].\nThe President. Good. Excellent. Well, Sudan is an example of some of what I was talking about earlier. I mean, there's a history in Darfur and other parts of the country of enormous conflict internal to Sudan. And our goal when we—oops, uh-oh, sorry, guys. [Laughter] I'm tearing up the stage here. [Laughter]\nThe—our goal when we put together a package of sanctions is not to punish the people of that country, but is rather to make sure that we can exert some leverage so that the country is more responsive to the needs of the people; that they are more prepared to open up government to peaceful concerns and people who are trying to organize around human rights or democracy or so forth. The pressure that we apply is not always enough to actually entirely change the practices inside those countries. And sometimes, let's face it, there are countries that are very resentful and suggest, \"Why don't you mind your own business?\" Right? Their attitude is, \"Who is America to tell us what to do when you yourselves have your own problems inside your country?\"\nAnd my response is that America has to have some humility in recognizing that we have our own issues; that ultimately, whether it's people in Cuba or people in Sudan or people in other parts of the world where there are challenges around human rights, that ultimately, it's going to be up to the people themselves in those countries to determine their fate.\nBut I do believe that there are certain principles that apply everywhere. I believe that governments should follow the law and not be arbitrary. I believe that every individual has certain rights: to speak freely and to practice their own faith freely and to assemble peacefully to petition their government. I believe that women should be treated equally and if you come from a country in which it is traditional to beat women or not give them an education or engage in genital mutilation, then you should change your traditions because those are bad practices.\nAnd so I do think it is important for us to stand up for those principles, recognizing that we're not perfect, that we need to listen to criticism just like other countries do, and also recognize that even as we may sanction a country, for example, we also need to engage with them so that there becomes the opportunity for dialogue and, hopefully, we can have some positive influence.\nNow, there are going to be times where—and I've said this before—where the United States is standing up for human rights, but the country that we're dealing with also is a partner on national security issues. And so we have to balance the needs for our security interests and having diplomatic relations with that country while still applying some pressure. And I think that sometimes people view this as hypocritical: Why aren't you always putting pressure on every country? If a country is doing some bad things to its people, you should have no dealings with them at all. And I will tell you that that's a luxury for people who are outside of government to be able to say that. But when you're inside of government, then you have to try to balance, okay, I'm going to engage with this Government; we're going to talk to this Government. We'll meet with them, and we will be honest with them about our differences even as we're working with them on some of the things that we agree on. And hopefully, over time, this makes a difference; it has some impact. Our hope is, is that Sudan, over time, is more responsive to the basic principles that we've discussed. That by engaging with them—sometimes around regional conflicts where we have common interests or around antiterrorism efforts—that the opportunities for dialogue improve the prospects for human rights.\nBut ultimately, it's going to depend on the courage and the conviction of people like you—people inside of Sudan or inside of any of your countries—to be able to bring about change in a peaceful fashion. All right? But we're very proud of you, so keep up your good work.\nAll right. It's a guy's turn. That man in the corner right there. Go ahead. No, no, this one right here. You, yes. Right there. Go ahead.\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo/African Development/Media Portrayals of Africa\nQ. Thanks very much, Mr. President. I need, first of all—if you can allow me—to ask to my Fellows, all of us, if you can just stand up and thank again once more the President Obama.\nThe President. Oh, you don't need to do that. That's fine. Thank you.\nQ. Thanks very much. I appreciate you too much. I'm Christian Mapendano from Congo. And first of all, I would like to thank you because you have given me the opportunity to know something about America. I've noticed that America is not perfect. Even our countries are not perfect. But I'm a journalist, and we have used media to destroy our Africa, to destroy our countries. Today, all they know about Africa, it's poverty, it's hunger, it's malnutrition. Although what I know—I'm speaking like a Congolese—Congo that I love too much.\nMy country has got many natural resources. And it's a victim of this wealth, of this richness, because powerful countries have used this to destroy our people, to bring war in our countries, to bring armed groups in our countries. And people are being poorer and poorer every day, and countries which are making armed weapons keep on improving, keep on developing, and this is not good.\nSo I'm going to ask a favor from you. The first one is that you are going to leave the White House, I think, by November so——\nThe President. January, but that's okay. [Laughter]\nQ. Yes. That's good. It will be in January. So I'll ask you one favor. First of all, if you can be a mentor to our leaders, political leaders, as soon as you are going to leave the White House. Please be a mentor to our African leaders because you are an African American to change this continent.\nThe President. All right.\nQ. And the second one favor—the second favor. I'll need a really a special picture with you. [Laughter] Thanks very much, President. [Laughter]\nThe President. [Laughter] All right. So this is as good a time as any to let you know that after I'm done, I'm going to shake everybody's hands. [Applause] No, no, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait—when I say everybody, I don't mean literally everybody. [Laughter] I'm going to—Because there are a thousand of you, I can't shake everybody, but——\nAudience members. Yes, you can! [Laughter] Yes, you can! Yes, you can! The President. No, no, no. No! I've got another job I've got to do. [Laughter] But here's what I cannot do is take selfies, so—because then, I'll be here for the next 4 hours. It won't work. So, no, you can't get your picture, I'm sorry.\nBut let me address your broader question. The Congo is a good example of a country with, as you said, enormous natural resources and a terrible history of abuse during colonialism, of conflict. As you said, weapons that are not made in the Congo are—pour into the Congo as part of other people's agenda.\nAnd so you both have enormous opportunities, but enormous challenges. But a couple of things I would say. Number one, even though it's important to know this history of what happened during colonial times in the Congo and what happened—subsequent during efforts of independence, and the way that other countries from the outside have meddled in ways that were not helpful to the people there, it is also important for every country to at some point say, it is now our responsibility. Even if we have an unjust history, now it is our responsibility, and we can't use the past as an excuse for some of the problems that we have today. And that's true everywhere.\nSo you have to be mindful of your history, because if you weren't mindful of your history then suddenly, you'd think, \"Wow, what's wrong with us?\" And in fact, there's reasons why a country like the Congo has had so many problems. But it can't be an excuse to then just sit back and say it's somebody else's problem or it's somebody else's fault. And I—that is a very important principle, I think, for every country on the continent.\nWe know the history of Africa. But now the question is, what's the new history that we're going to write? All right? What are the next chapters that we're going to write?\nIn terms of the media portrayals of Africa, I think you're correct that the United States sometimes only sees Africa in terms of stereotypes. It's either the Wild Life Channel and its beautiful safaris, or it's poverty and war. And too often, Americans just don't realize there are a lot of people who are just going to work every day. [Laughter] And they do wear clothes, it's true—[laughter]—and raising families and getting an education and creating businesses.\nSo since you're a journalist, one of your goals should be to help tell Africa's story. And the good news is that because of the power of the Internet—and it used to be that in order to make a film, you had to have millions of dollars and cameras and this—now, you take out your phone, or you have a small camcorder, and you can produce content that immediately is reaching millions of people. So you can tell your own stories in a way that you could not before.\nAnd I would encourage all of you, no matter whether you're in business or in politics or working for an NGO, to think about, how are you telling a story about Africa and its possibilities? Because the platform now exists for more and more people to understand the enormous potential and the good news that's taking place in Africa, not just the bad news. Okay.\nIt's a woman's turn. I don't want to neglect everybody here in the—right here in the back. This young lady in the purple here. Go ahead.\nWork-Family Balance/Accountability in Government/Freedom of the Press\nQ. Thank you, sir. My name is Juby Peacock. I'm from Botswana. Yes. I want to ask a question about balance and responsibility. Yes. I've watched how you have led in your Presidency with your wife Michelle Obama, with your family life in the public squares, and how you've managed to have balance between your public office and your home. And I believe charity begins in the home. And I've admired that about America, that your democracy is so open. You are investigated before you get into power and when you are in power.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. How important is it for the young people here today to understand that it's important when you are in public office to run your family well, to take care of your wife or your husband and your children? Also, that it's very important for us to hold each other accountable. If you are a ruler, not to engage in greed or nepotism or corruption, and also us to hold them accountable for what they are doing? Thank you.\nThe President. Well, I think that's a great question. I—well, let me separate out the two questions. Because one question is about holding leaders accountable in their public lives and how they do their jobs. And the other question is really a more personal question about maintaining balance in your life.\nWith respect to the personal question, what I would say would be that maintaining balance, having a strong partnership with your wife or husband, raising children who are kind and useful and strong and generous and all of the things that my wonderful daughters are—that really is its own reward.\nThe truth is, we've had some very great leaders who did not always have great personal lives. And I'm not actually somebody who believes that if you go into public office, that your personal lives—I mean, unless you're committing crimes or things like that—that that is necessarily the best measure. Because we've also had people who were wonderful fathers and great husbands who were bad leaders. So the two things don't always align.\nFor me, the reason that it's been useful for me to maintain that balance is because I think it's grounded me. It's given me a sense of perspective. It's allowed me during the course of my Presidency, when things aren't going so well, to remember that I have this beautiful family and this wonderful wife.\nAnd the—and when things are going very well, it's good to go home, and then my wife teases me about how I left my shoes in the middle of the living room. [Laughter] Or my girls think what I am talking about over dinner is boring. And that brings me down to Earth, right? And so it's been good for me to maintain perspective in my work.\nBut ultimately, I do that—and for very selfish reasons—it's for my own rewards. Because the one thing I'm almost positive about—in fact, not only am I almost, I am positive that if I'm lucky enough to live to a ripe old age and I'm on my deathbed and I'm thinking back on my life, I won't be remembering some speech I gave or some law I signed. I'll be remembering holding hands with my—one of my daughters and walking them to a park; that that will be the thing that is most precious for me. So that's on the private side.\nNow, on the public side, what I would say is, is that although not perfect, the United States is actually pretty good about holding its leaders accountable. Part of that has to do with freedom of the press. Part of it has to do with our separation of powers so that it's not one person in charge of everything, but even the President of the United States is subject to the Constitution. That Constitution is interpreted by a Supreme Court. If I want to pass a budget, it has to go through Congress. Even if I get everything through the Federal level, there are still States and cities that have their own perspective. You have a private sector. So power is dispersed not just in one big man, but across the society. And I think that is very good. Now, it's frustrating sometimes, I won't lie. There are times where the press—right now I'm at the end of my Presidency, so the press is kind of feeling a little sentimental. And they think, oh, he's gotten old. Look at him. We've beat him up. And so—[laughter]. Now, let's focus on the new guys coming in.\nBut there have been times where I thought the press was very unfair, and I'd open up the newspapers and I'd go, what? And I'd start arguing. But there have also been times where the press investigated something, and I thought, you know what, this is a problem. And the United States Government, you have—I have 2 million people who work in the Federal Government. You know, if—we have a budget of over a trillion dollars. It's the largest organization on Earth. So there are going to be times where Government is screwing up. And the fact that the press is there to ask questions and to expose problems does make me work harder. It focuses me on, that is a problem.\nAnd too often, in too many countries around the world, the attitude of the people in charge is, I want to shut up the criticism instead of fixing the problem. And that is not good for the people, and in the end, it's not good for the President, the Prime Minister, those in charge. Because over time, what happens is, you get—you just hear what you want to hear.\nIt's as if you had a doctor who, whatever the checkup, he just kept on telling you, \"You're fine.\" And then suddenly, you start having a big growth in your neck. [Laughter] He said: \"Aw, don't worry about it. It's fine.\" [Laughter] And you start limping, and it's, like, \"Aw, if—you're healthy, you're great.\" And you never get well.\nSo I think the importance of accountability and transparency in government is the starting point for any society improving. And now, that also means that the press has responsibilities to make sure that it's accurate, to make sure that it doesn't just chase whatever is the most sensational, but tries to be thoughtful and present as best it can, a fair view of what's happening. But in the end, I'd rather have the press err on the side of freedom—even if sometimes, it's a little inaccurate—than to have the person who is governing the country making decisions about who is wrong and who is right and who can say what and who can publish what. Because that's the path to not just dictatorship, but it's also the path to not fixing the real problems that exist. All right?\nOkay. It's a gentleman's turn. Yes, the—I'll call on this guy right here. So I need a translator; yes, my sign language is not so good. We need a sign——\n[At this point, an audience member communicated in sign language, and his question was translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nEducation/Role of Government in Free Enterprise System\nQ. Thank you so much. So you're definitely a visionary and with Martin Luther King. I can relate to you—I can relate the both of you together. So, in America, a lot of countries—sorry, there's a lot of States. And there's a lot of countries that we are coming from that have diversity. There are visas that have to be filled out. There's a lottery system that you have to go through. And so while everyone is coming to the U.S.—you know, there's a medical system. There's—there are people who are seeking to get their Ph.D.s, to get their doctorates, to get a lot of educational advances. There's a lot of educational advances that people are having. And so while people are coming here, they're seeing that they're not able to——\n[The interpreter spoke as follows.]\nInterpreter. Sorry, we're translating multiple languages. [The audience member continued to sign, and the remainder of his question was translated by a second interpreter as follows.]\nQ. ——for example, becoming a physician or becoming an engineer. That individuals that come from Africa can, in fact, achieve their dreams. They can come to the United States, and they have a limitless option of educational tracks that they can take to have good work and not necessarily depend specifically on the profession to do it for them. And the Government can be an aid in that process to help them excel in their profession.\nAnd also, the second part of my question: There are many objectives and goals, but right now, as you are coming to the end of your Presidency, how do you feel as though you can personally continue the initiatives that you've set forth for Africa since you are coming so quickly to the end of your Presidency? What are your plans to continue those objectives?\nThe President. Okay. Good. So—oh, I'm sorry—\nQ. I have a supplementary third part, I'm so sorry. [Laughter]\nThe President. But we don't want too long a question.\n[The audience member continued to sign, but no translation was provided.]\nThe President. All right, can I answer? No. Good.\nSo, first of all, I thought that was very cool that you had, like, kind of a three-way translation going on there. [Laugher] So you had the sign language, that was then signed back, that was then translated to English. So there was just a whole bunch of really smart people communicating.\nBut if I understood the first part of your question, look, one of the great achievements of the United States is our university system, which, it really is unparalleled anywhere in the world. It's not just one or two great universities. We have hundreds of great universities. And we have an entire community college system that allows people to get practical training as well, even if they don't get a 4-year degree, and that is a huge advantage. Because those countries that are investing in human capital, that are training people, are going to do better—that's the most valuable resource. There are countries that have natural resources, but if their people are not valued as the more important resource, those countries will not succeed.\nYesterday I had a State dinner with the Prime Minister of Singapore. Singapore is a tiny, little island, just a little spot, a little dot on a map. But it has one of the most wealthy, well-educated, advanced populations in the world, not because they've got oil or because they've got precious gems, but because their people have been educated and they can thrive in this new knowledge-based society. So it's a huge advantage for us.\nNow, I think in each of your countries, it is really important for your current leadership and many of you who will be future leaders to make sure that, first and foremost, that educational infrastructure is in place. And it has be to be provided for everybody—not just boys, but girls—and it's got to start early because you can't leave half of your population behind and expect that you're going to succeed.\nAnd by the way, let's face it, the mothers, even in enlightened marriages like mine, are probably doing more in terms of teaching children than the fathers are. So if you're not teaching the mother that means the child also is not getting taught. And so the first is to create the infrastructure where people are learning. But I think one of the points you're making also though, is we have some countries where people are getting degrees, but because of the rules and the regulations and the policies are not allowing for enough entrepreneurship and enough private sector growth, then you have people who are educated, but they're frustrated because they can't find good work.\nAnd so it's not enough just to educate a population. You then also have to have rules in place where if you want to start a business, you don't have to pay a bribe. Or you don't have to hire somebody's cousin who then is not going to show up on the job, but expects to get paid. Or if you want to get electricity installed, you have to wait for 5 months to get a line into your office. Right?\nSo all the rules, the regulations, the laws, the structures that are in place to encourage development and growth—that has to be combined with the education in order for those young people who now have talent to be able to move forward. And too often, what I've seen in a lot of African countries—and this is not unique to Africa, you see it in a lot of other places—there's this perspective of, okay, you get an education, and then you get a slot in some government office somewhere. And if you don't get one of those slots, then that's it, you don't have any—there's no opportunity. And I am a strong believer that government—strong, effective, transparent government—is a precondition for a market-based economy. You can't have one without the other.\nBut what is also true is that if every job is a government job, then there's going to come a point where you're not going to be able to accommodate all the talents of your people. So you have to be able to create a private sector, a marketplace, where people who have a new idea, who have a new product or service, they can go out there and they can create something. And if you don't have that, then you're going to frustrate the vision and the ambitions of too many young people in your country.\nSo I think the—America in the past has done this well. Our big problem here in this country is sometimes we forget how we became so wealthy in the first place. And you start hearing arguments about, \"Oh, we don't want to pay taxes to fund the universities,\" or \"We don't want to pay taxes to maintain our roads properly, because why should I have to invest in society. I made it on my own.\" And we forget that, well, the reason that you had this opportunity to go work at Google or to go work at General Motors or to go work at IBM had to do with a lot of investments that were made in science and research and roads and ports and all the infrastructure that helps preserve the ability of people who want to operate effectively in the marketplace to be able to make it.\nAnd I always tell people who are antigovernment in the United States, try going to a country where the government doesn't work. [Laughter] And you'll see that you actually want a good government. It's a useful thing to have, but it's not enough on its own if you also don't have then the ability of people in the private sector to succeed.\nAll right. It's a woman's turn. Let's see. The guys, you can sit down. Guys, it's not your turn. [Laughter] This young lady right here. Yes. No, not you. I said this young lady right here. [Laughter] Come on, man.\n[An audience member shouted out the name of a university.]\nEvent staffer. Excuse me.\nThe President. What's your name?\nEnglish Language Instruction Q. My name is Folaké Diane. I come from Benin, and thank you, Mr. President, for giving us this opportunity. When you were speaking, you spoke about leaving people behind. I want to use that same phrase to mention here that we have left a lot of young and dynamic other people behind to come here in the United States. And what has been the barrier? I want to pay tribute to every Fellows who come from every African countries, but I want to pay a special tribute to all Fellows who have come from Mali, Senegal, Niger, Cote d'Ivoire, and Benin.\nThe challenge is twofold, Mr. President. Not only do we have to qualify as good leaders, we also have to qualify as good English speakers. But we have people back home who cannot speak this language. Mr. President, you are at the end of your term. I would like you to partner with all these countries—Mali, Benin, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, Mozambique—to help us build English clubs, English language centers for young people to be able to be more efficient and seize this opportunity. Thank you very much.\nThe President. Okay. [Applause] Hey! I think you make an excellent point. Obviously, we have people who are here from Francophile countries or from Portuguese-speaking countries, but what we also want to make sure of is that everybody can participate. And for a range of historical reasons, English has become in some ways a lingua franca. And frankly, I wish we as Americans did a better job of learning other languages. One of the things about being a big country, we've always kind of felt like, oh, we don't need it. But now, in an interconnected world, the more languages we speak, the better.\nSo I think it's excellent practical advice. And we will work with our team to think about how we can incorporate English learning into our program. So thank you very much for that news I can use. [Laughter]\nAll right, let's see. We've got a gentleman—this guy right here, yes, in the cool hat.\nEvent staffer. Which——\nThe President. Well, you both have cool hats, but I was calling on him. [Laughter]\nEvent staffer This gentleman?\nThe President. Right here. Go ahead.\nPublic Service\nQ. Thank you so much, Mr. President. I want to just start by saying thank you so much for this opportunity. I think you've done a great job as the President, and you inspire a lot of us young African leaders. Also, I want to say that back home where I come from—my name is Fola Aina by the way. I'm Nigerian. Where I come from, there are lots of bottlenecks and barriers to the youths participating in politics because politics we see as a platform that offers change we desire to implement. So what is your advice, being in the White House for 8 years, coming as a young enthusiast to the White House and, after 8 years, the things you've seen from where you came from and now—what advice do you have for young Africans who aspire to run for office? And what do you think they can do to make a difference even when they get to political office? That's one.\nAnd secondly, this is just to use this opportunity to say a big shout-out, my wife admires you a lot. And I promised that if I get a chance to talk to you, I would say hi on her behalf.\nThe President. Okay. So you see, he's keeping balance. [Laughter] Making sure he can go back home and say, \"Hey, honey, I've—[laughter]—I was looking after you.” People here in the States—we have a White House Interns Program, and I often talk to young people after they complete their internship at the White House. And they ask me a similar question: What advice would I give for people who are interested in public service and politics? And obviously, each country is different. Some countries are more challenging because democratic policies are still not so deeply entrenched. Oftentimes, there's not as much turnover in government because people once they get in, they don't want to leave. In part, by the way, that also has to do with the lack of opportunity in the private sector.\nOne of the reasons why you want to have a country that has a good, strong government, but also a private sector is if you don't have a good, strong private sector, then the temptation for people to stay in power in government because that's the only way to make a living or to succeed, you know, that becomes a strong temptation. And that then leads to the temptation to corruption or to suppress opposition or to not have honest elections because you're hanging on, because if you lose, you've got nothing, right?\nAnd one of the good things about the United States is that, look, you run for office, if you lose, yes, there's other ways of making a living. It's not a tragedy. [Laughter] And, no—and it's interesting, I mean, there were times where—during my political career, there were times where I thought, You know what, this isn't going all that well. And I remember when I ran for the United States Senate. I had already lost a race to be in Congress. I had been in the State senate for 8 years. It was putting enormous strains on my family because I was traveling a lot. And I thought to myself, you know what, this is it. If I don't win this U.S. Senate race, I'm getting out of politics. I'm going to go do something else. And I was comfortable with that view.\nIt also meant that once I became President—and people have talked about, for example, in my first term, when I was trying to get the health care law passed, and the politics of it were not going well, and people were very angry and oftentimes misinformed about what it would do. I decided, look, even if this means that I don't get a second term, I'm going to go ahead and do it anyway. And part of the reason was because I said, if I lose, I'll be upset, it'll be a little embarrassing, but I'll be okay, and there's no point in me being in office if I can't actually do something with the office.\nSo the—now, that leads me to the main advice that I would have for those of you who are interested in politics or government. I always say to young people: Worry less about what you want to be and worry more about what you want to do. Now—because those are two different things.\nI think one of the problems we get sometimes here in Washington is, we have people—not everybody and maybe not even the majority—but there are people here who they had in their mind very early on, \"I want to be a Congressman.\" And then, they're doing everything they can to be a Congressman, and then, once they become a Congressman, they don't know why they're a Congressman. [Laughter] All they know is, they want to stay a Congressman. [Laughter]\nAnd so this is true not just in politics, I think this is true in business as well. The most successful businesspeople I know, they don't start off saying, \"I want to be rich.\" What they say is, \"I want to invent the personal computer.\" And then, it turns out, wow, Steve Jobs or Hewlett and Packard or Bill Gates—you guys did a really good job, and it just so happened that it made you really rich. But there was a passion about trying to get something done. It's certainly true in politics.\nSo if you want to be in politics, what I—my advice to you would be, why? What is it that you want to do? Do you want to provide a good education to young people? Do you want to alleviate poverty? Do you want to make sure that everybody has health care? Do you want to promote peace between ethnic groups in your country? Do you want to preserve the environment? And whatever it is that you want to do, start doing it. Because you don't have to have an office to do that. You can start a program to help young women in your village get an education. You can decide in whatever part of Nigeria you're from that you're going to go back and try to promote health and wealth—wellness programs for young people. And the experience you get from actually doing these things then will inform the nature of why you might want to go into politics.\nFirst of all, it may turn out that you are making such a difference and having such an impact without going into politics that you decide, I don't want to do that. I want to keep on building what I'm doing. If you do decide to go into politics, you will have not only the experience, but also the credibility with the people you want to represent because they've seen you actually do something useful.\nAnd the last point I would make is, politics is a little bit like going into acting or being a musician. And what I mean by that is, you can be really talented, but maybe the timing is off. Maybe you didn't get the lucky break. And so you can't guarantee that you're going to be elected or successful in a particular office.\nI mean, when you think about me being President of the United States, it was quite unlikely. And I still remember—I ran for the Senate. I won my primary, but I still had a general election. And then, I was selected to speak at the Democratic National Convention, and—this is in 2004. And the fact that John Kerry picked me to speak was sort of accidental. And I gave a pretty good speech so—[applause]. No, no—but, wait, wait. That—so the day after the speech, my name's everywhere, and I'm on television. And people are saying, \"Wow, who is this guy, Obama?\" [Laughter] That was wonderful. We're really impressed. And he's got a future. And maybe someday he's going to run for President and et cetera.\nAnd I told my friend—because we were still in Boston—and we were walking, and there were these huge crowds, and everybody is wanting to shake my hand, and I said, \"I'm no more smarter today than I was yesterday.\" [Laughter] I mean, you know, I didn't suddenly magically become so much better than I was when I was just a State Senator. Some of it had to do with just chance. It was luck.\nSo you don't have control completely over luck, over fate, over chance. But you do have control over being useful and getting good work done in your communities. So stay focused on that. And then, if you stay focused on that, then maybe success comes in politics. But if it doesn't, you will still be able to wake up every morning and say, you know what, I'm making a difference. I'm doing good work.\nSo all right. I've only got time for one question. Yes, I've been working hard up here. One question. So the young lady in the hijab, right there. Yes. Right there, go ahead. Where are you from?\nThe President's Young Leaders Initiatives\nQ. I'm from Sudan.\nThe President. Oh, no, no, no. I can't do another Sudanese.\nQ. Oh! The President. I love you, though, but I have to be fair to—I've got to make sure every country—countries get a chance. I can't hear. I can't hear. Wait, wait, wait, I can't hear. Cameroon. Okay, go ahead. All right, right here, from Cameroon. But I will shake your hand, though, because I feel it was unfair for me to call on you. So you can come up to the front. I'll make sure to shake your hand.\nAll right, go ahead.\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity. I'm Lilian. I'm from Cameroon. Thank you.\nSome of us come from areas where our governments don't really integrate what we do here in the U.S.—governments that are a little bit, maybe, hostile, the environment hostile. What are some of the strategies you're putting in place to make sure that this—our governments integrate all that we have done here so that we can better impact our environment? Thank you.\nThe President. Good. Well, we've been talking about this with the State Department. Because one of my goals is to make sure that the program continues after I leave.\nAnd I think that we have a great interest in both promoting this program, but then also working with your governments so that they see this is an enormous opportunity for them. What we want to let them know is that the talent that all of you represent is going to be the future of your countries. And so take advantage.\nWe'll partner with you, but also with your governments, to work on the projects that you've designed to make sure that you have a, sort of, a sponsor that is kind of looking out for you. I think the fact that we've created these four regional centers and this network and that our Embassies in each of your countries are aware of what you've done will be helpful to you.\nBut in the end of the day, as I've said before, you're going to be the ones who actually have to take advantage of the opportunities. I mean, there's going to be some things we can do, but at the end of the day, your vision will have to be won by you and by your fellow countrymen and women.\nSo part of the reason why I love this program is, this isn't a matter of what America is doing for you, this is us being partners, but mainly seeing what you can do yourselves to change, transform, and build your countries.\nAnd I don't want to be—look, I want to be honest with you. There are over 50 countries represented here. It represents a wide spectrum. Some of you are going to go back and what you're doing is welcomed. Some of you will go back and not so much. Depending on the kinds of things that you want to do—maybe if you're just focused on public health—you'll get less resistance. If you are interested in human rights or democracy, you might get more resistance. There are some countries where you being active and speaking out publicly can be dangerous. There are some places where it's welcomed. There are some places where freedom of the press is observed, other places where it is viewed as objectionable.\nI can't—and America cannot—solve all those problems. And if I were to promise that, I would not be telling the truth. But what I can do is to make sure that the program continues, that the network continues to get built, and that the State Department is engaged with your countries explaining why what you represent is so important to the continent. And what I can also commit to is, is that even after I am President that this will be a program that I continue to participate in and work with because it's something that I'm very, very proud of.\nSo thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-08-03", "title": "Remarks at a Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders Town Hall and a Question-and-Answer Session"}

Policy. Recognizing the tremendous potential of expanding the U.S.-Africa commercial relationship, the United States in 2014 launched the Trade Africa Initiative, a partnership between the United States and Sub-Saharan Africa, and created a U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa outlining a comprehensive U.S. policy for the region, among other activities. Ensuring that such initiatives and activities reflect the priorities of, and benefit from the support of, the private sector is critical to their success. For that reason, in Executive Order 13675 of August 5, 2014, I directed the Secretary of Commerce to establish the President's Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa (Council). Since its establishment in November 2014, the Council has been actively engaged in advising on strengthening commercial engagement between the United States and Africa and has provided numerous recommendations on a broad range of issues. In light of the numerous U.S. Government initiatives and activities to promote expansion of the commercial relationship, the breadth of U.S. private sector engagement in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the range of issues on which future advice may be requested, broader representation of the diversity of private sector viewpoints, experiences, and knowledge on the Council is warranted. Thus I am increasing the membership of the Council.\nSec. 2. Amendment to Executive Order 13675. Executive Order 13675 of August 5, 2014, is amended in section 3(a) by striking \"shall consist of not more than 15 private sector corporate members\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"shall consist of not more than 26 private sector corporate members\".\nSec. 3.

Good afternoon, everybody. I just met again with my National Security Council on the campaign to destroy ISIL. I want to thank Secretary Carter and Chairman Dunford, who just returned from meetings with our coalition partners in the Middle East, for hosting us and for their continued leadership of our men and women in uniform.\nI last updated the American people on our campaign in June, shortly after the horrifying attack in Orlando. In the weeks since, we've continued to be relentless in our fight against ISIL, and on the ground in Syria and Iraq, ISIL continues to lose territory. Tragically, however, we have also seen that ISIL still has the ability to direct and inspire attacks. So we've seen terrible bombings in Iraq and in Jordan, in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Afghanistan; attacks on an Istanbul airport, a restaurant in Bangladesh, Bastille Day celebrations and a church in France, and a music festival in Germany. In fact, the decline of ISIL in Syria and Iraq appears to be causing it to shift to tactics that we've seen before: an even greater emphasis on encouraging high-profile terrorist attacks, including in the United States.\nAs always, our military, diplomatic, intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement professionals are working around the clock—with other countries and with communities here at home—to share information and prevent such attacks. And over the years, they've prevented many. But as we've seen, it is still very difficult to detect and prevent lone actors or small cells of terrorists who are determined to kill the innocent and are willing to die. And that's why, as we discussed today, we're going to keep going after ISIL aggressively across every front of this campaign.\nOur air campaign continues to hammer ISIL targets: more than 14,000 strikes so far, more than 100,000 sorties, including those hitting the ISIL core in Raqqa and in Mosul. And in stark contrast to ISIL, which uses civilians as human shields, America's Armed Forces will continue to do everything in our power to avoid civilian casualties. With our extraordinary technology, we're conducting the most precise air campaign in history. After all, it is the innocent civilians of Syria and Iraq who are suffering the most and who need to be saved from ISIL's terror. And so when there are allegations of civilian casualties, we take them very seriously. We work to find the facts, to be transparent, and to hold ourselves accountable for doing better in the future.\nWe continue to take out senior ISIL leaders and commanders. This includes ISIL's deputy minister of war, Basim Muhammad al-Bajari; a top commander in Mosul, Hatim Talib al-Hamduni; and in yet another significant loss for ISIL, its minister of war, Omar al-Shishani. None of ISIL's leaders are safe, and we are going to keep going after them.\nOn the ground in Iraq, local forces keep pushing ISIL back. In a major success, Iraqi forces, with coalition support, finally liberated Fallujah. Now they're clearing ISIL fighters from more areas up the Euphrates Valley, and Iraqi forces retook the strategic airbase at Qayyarah, just 40 miles from Mosul, now the last major ISIL stronghold in Iraq. Given this success, the additional 560 U.S. support personnel that I ordered to Iraq last month will help turn this base into a logistical hub and launch pad for Iraqi forces as they push into Mosul. Meanwhile, in Syria, a coalition of local forces—backed by our special operations forces and airstrikes—continues to take the fight to ISIL as well. The coalition is fighting its way into the town of Manbij, a gateway for ISIL fighters coming in and terrorists heading out to attack Europe, which is why ISIL is fighting hard to hold it. As ISIL is beaten back, we're gaining vast amounts of intelligence—thousands of documents, thumb drives, digital files—which we will use to keep destroying ISIL's networks and stop foreign fighters. We also continue to intensify our efforts against Al Qaida in Syria, which—no matter what name it calls itself—cannot be allowed to maintain a safe haven to train and plot attacks against us.\nI do want to step back and note the broader progress that has been made in this campaign so far. Two years ago, ISIL was racing across Iraq, to the outskirts of Baghdad itself, and to many observers, ISIL looked invincible. Since then, in Iraq, ISIL has lost at the Mosul Dam, at Tikrit, at Baiji, at Sinjar, at Ramadi, at Hit, at Rutbah, and now Fallujah. In Syria, ISIL has lost at Kobani and Tal Abyad and the Tishrin Dam and al-Shaddadi. ISIL has lost territory across vast stretches of the border with Turkey and almost all major transit routes into Raqqa. And in both Iraq and Syria, ISIL has not been able to reclaim any significant territory that they have lost.\nSo I want to repeat: ISIL has not had a major successful offensive operation in either Syria or Iraq in a full year. Even ISIL's leaders know they're going to keep losing. In their message to followers, they're increasingly acknowledging that they may lose Mosul and Raqqa. And ISIL is right, they will lose them. And we'll keep hitting them and pushing them back and driving them out until they do. In other words, ISIL turns out not to be invincible. They are, in fact, inevitably going to be defeated.\nBut we do recognize, at the same time, that the situation is complex and this cannot be solved by military force alone. That's why, last month, the United States and countries around the world pledged more than $2 billion in new funds to help Iraqis stabilize and rebuild their communities. It's why we're working with Iraq so that the military campaign to liberate Mosul is matched with humanitarian and political efforts to protect civilians and promote inclusive governance and development so ISIL cannot return by exploiting divisions or new grievances.\nIn Syria, as I've repeatedly said, defeating ISIL and Al Qaida requires an end to the civil war and the Asad regime's brutality against the Syrian people, which pushes people into the arms of extremists. The regime and its allies continue to violate the cessation of hostilities, including with vicious attacks on defenseless civilians, medieval sieges against cities like Aleppo, and blocking food from reaching families that are starving. It is deplorable. And the depravity of the Syrian regime has rightly earned the condemnation of the world.\nRussia's direct involvement in these actions over the last several weeks raises very serious questions about their commitment to pulling the situation back from the brink. The U.S. remains prepared to work with Russia to try to reduce the violence and strengthen our efforts against ISIL and Al Qaida in Syria. But so far, Russia has failed to take the necessary steps. Given the deteriorating situation, it is time for Russia to show that it is serious about pursuing these objectives.\nBeyond Syria and Iraq, we'll keep working with allies and partners to go after ISIL wherever it tries to spread. At the request of Libya's Government of National Accord, we are conducting strikes in support of Government-aligned forces as they fight to retake Sirte from ISIL, and we will continue to support the Government's efforts to secure their country. In Afghanistan, one of the reasons that I decided to largely maintain our current force posture was so that we could keep eliminating ISIL's presence there, and we delivered another blow last month when we took out a top ISIL leader in Afghanistan, Umar Khalifa.\nFinally, it should be clear by now—and no one knows this better than our military leaders—that even as we need to crush ISIL on the battlefield, their military defeat will not be enough. So long as their twisted ideology persists and drives people to violence, then groups like ISIL will keep emerging and the international community will continue to be at risk in getting sucked into the kind of global Whac-A-Mole where we're always reacting to the latest threat or lone actor. And that's why we're also working to counter violent extremism more broadly, including the social, economic, and political factors that help fuel groups like ISIL and Al Qaida in the first place.\nNothing will do more to discredit ISIL and its phony claims to being a caliphate than when it loses its base in Raqqa and in Mosul. And we're going to keep working with partners—including Muslim countries and communities, especially online—to expose ISIL for what they are: murderers who kill innocent people, including Muslim families and children as they break their Ramadan fast, and who set off bombs in Medina near the Prophet's Mosque, one of the holiest sites in Islam.\nMoreover, we refuse to let terrorists and voices of division undermine the unity and the values of diversity and pluralism that keep our Nation strong. One of the reasons that America's Armed Forces are the best in the world is because we draw on the skills and the talents of all of our citizens, from all backgrounds and faiths, including patriotic Muslim Americans who risk and give their lives for our freedom. And I think the entire world was inspired this past Sunday, when Muslims across France joined their Catholic neighbors at Mass and, in a moving display of solidarity, prayed together. The greeting they extended to each other has to be the message we echo in all of our countries and all of our communities: Peace be with you, and also with you.\nNow, before I take some questions, I also want to say a few words on another topic. As our public health experts have been warning for some time, we are now seeing the first locally transmitted cases of the Zika virus by mosquitoes in the continental United States. This was predicted and predictable. So far, we've seen 15 cases in the Miami area. We're taking this extremely seriously. Our CDC experts are on the ground working shoulder to shoulder with Florida health authorities. There's a very aggressive effort underway to control mosquitoes there. And pregnant women have been urged to stay away from the particular neighborhood that we're focused on. We'll keep working as one team—Federal, State, and local—to try to slow and limit the spread of the virus.\nI do want to be very clear though: Our public health experts do not expect to see the kind of widespread outbreaks of Zika here that we've seen in Brazil or in Puerto Rico. The kind of mosquitoes that are most likely to carry Zika are limited to certain regions of our country. But we cannot be complacent because we do expect to see more Zika cases. And even though the symptoms for most people are mild—many may never even know that they have it—we've seen that the complications for pregnant women and their babies can be severe. So I, again, want to encourage every American to learn what they can do to help stop Zika by going to CDC.gov.\nIn addition, Congress needs to do its job. Fighting Zika costs money. Helping Puerto Rico deal with its Zika crisis costs money. Research into new vaccines—and by the way, NIH just announced the first clinical trials in humans—that costs money. And that's why my administration proposed an urgent request for more funding back in February. Not only did the Republican-led Congress not pass our request, they worked to cut it. And then, they left for summer recess without passing any new funds for the fight against Zika.\nMeanwhile, our experts at the NIH and CDC—the folks on the frontlines—have been doing their best and making do by moving funds from other areas. But now the money that we need to fight Zika is rapidly running out. The situation is getting critical. For instance, without sufficient funding, NIH critical trials—clinical trials and the possibilities of a vaccine, which is well within reach, could be delayed.\nSo this is not the time for politics. More than 40 U.S. servicemembers have now contracted Zika overseas. In 50 U.S. States, we know of more than 1,800 cases of Zika connected to travel to infected areas, and that includes nearly 500 pregnant women. Zika is now present in almost every part of Puerto Rico. And now we have the first local transmission in Florida, and there will certainly be more.\nAnd meanwhile, Congress is on a summer recess. A lot of folks talk about protecting Americans from threats. Well, Zika is a serious threat to Americans—especially babies—right now. So, once again, I want to urge the American people to call their Members of Congress and tell them to do their job: Deal with this threat, help protect the American people from Zika.\nWith that, I'm going to take some questions. I'm going to start with someone who just assumed the second most powerful office in the land—Jeff Mason—[laughter]—the new Correspondents' Association president—also from Reuters.\nJeff.\nQ. Thank you, sir. Hardly powerful. And happy birthday.\nThe President. Thank you very much.\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization/U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy/Security Briefings for Presidential Nominees\nQ. As Islamic State loses territory, you and other officials have said that it is becoming a more traditional terrorist group. Are you satisfied that the United States and its allies have shifted strategy sufficiently to address that change?\nAnd secondly, given your comments this week about Donald Trump's volatility and lack of fitness to be President, are you concerned that he will be receiving security briefings about ISIS and other sensitive national security issues?\nThe President. Okay. I'm never satisfied with our response, because if you're satisfied that means the problem is solved, and it's not. So we just spent a couple hours meeting with my top national security folks to look at what more can be done.\nIt is absolutely necessary for us to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria. It is not sufficient, but it is necessary. Because so long as they have those bases, they can use their propaganda to suggest that somehow there's still some caliphate being born, and that can insinuate itself then in the minds of folks who may be willing to travel there or carry out terrorist attacks. It's also destabilizing for countries in the region at a time when the region is already unstable.\nSo I am pleased with the progress that we've made on the ground in Iraq and Syria. We're far from freeing Mosul and Raqqa. But what we've shown is, is that when it comes to conventional fights, ISIL can be beaten with partners on the ground so long as they've got the support from coalition forces that we've been providing.\nIn the meantime, though, you're seeing ISIL carry out external terrorist acts, and they've learned something they've adapted from Al Qaida, which had a much more centralized operation and tried to plan very elaborate attacks. And what ISIL has figured out is that if they can convince a handful of people, or even one person, to carry out an attack on a subway or at a parade or some other public venue and kill scores of people, as opposed to thousands of people, it still creates the kinds of fear and concern that elevates their profile.\nSo, in some ways, rooting out these networks for smaller, less complicated attacks is tougher, because it doesn't require as many resources on their part or preparation. But it does mean that we've got to do even more to generate the intelligence and to work with our partners in order to degrade those networks.\nAnd the fact is, is that those networks will probably sustain themselves even after ISIL is defeated in Raqqa and Mosul. But what we've learned from our efforts to defeat Al Qaida is that if we stay on it, our intelligence gets better, and we adapt as well. And eventually, we will dismantle these networks also.\nThis is part of the reason why, however, it is so important for us to keep our eye on the ball and not panic, not succumb to fear. Because ISIL can't defeat the United States of America or our NATO partners. We can defeat ourselves, though, if we make bad decisions. And we have to understand that as painful and as tragic as these attacks are, that we are going to keep on grinding away, preventing them wherever we can, using a whole-of-Government effort to knock down their propaganda, to disrupt their networks, to take their key operatives off the battlefield, and that eventually, we will win.\nBut if we start making bad decisions—indiscriminately killing civilians, for example, in some of these areas, instituting offensive religious tests on who can enter the country—those kinds of strategies can end up backfiring. Because in order for us to ultimately win this fight, we cannot frame this as a clash of civilizations between the West and Islam. That plays exactly into the hands of ISIL and the perversions—the perverse interpretations of Islam that they're putting forward.\nAs far as Mr. Trump, we are going to go by the law, which is that—and in both tradition and the law—that if somebody is the nominee, the Republican nominee for President, they need to get a security briefing so that if they were to win, they are not starting from scratch in terms of being prepared for this office.\nAnd I'm not going to go into details of the nature of the security briefings that both candidates receive. What I will say is that they have been told these are classified briefings. And if they want to be President, they've got to start acting like President, and that means being able to receive these briefings and not spread them around.\nQ. Are you worried about that?\nThe President. Well, I think I've said enough on that.\nMary Bruce [ABC News].\nU.S. Release of Frozen Iranian Financial Assets/U.S. Hostage Negotiation Policy/Release of U.S. Citizens Detained in Iran/Iran Nuclear Agreement Q. Thank you, Mr. President. What is your response to critics who say the $400 million in cash that you sent to Iran was a ransom payment? Was it really simply a pure coincidence that a sum that was—a payment that was held up for almost four decades was suddenly sent at the exact same time that the American prisoners were released? And can you assure the American people that none of that money went to support terrorism?\nThe President. Okay. The—it's been interesting to watch this story surface. Some of you may recall, we announced these payments in January, many months ago. There wasn't a secret. Right? We announced them to all of you. Josh did a briefing on them. This wasn't some nefarious deal. And at the time, we explained that Iran had pressed a claim before an international tribunal about them recovering money of theirs that we had frozen; that, as a consequence of its working its way through the international tribunal, it was the assessment of our lawyers that we were now at a point where there was significant litigation risk and we could end up costing ourselves billions of dollars. It was their advice and suggestion that we settle. And that's what these payments represent. And it wasn't a secret. We were completely open with everybody about it. And it's interesting to me how suddenly this became a story again. That's point number one.\nPoint number two: We do not pay ransom for hostages. We've got a number of Americans being held all around the world. And I meet with their families, and it is heartbreaking. And we have stood up an entire section of interagency experts who devote all their time to working with these families to get these Americans out.\nBut those families know that we have a policy that we don't pay ransom. And the notion that we would somehow start now in this high-profile way and announce it to the world—even as we're looking into the faces of other hostage families—families whose loved ones are being held hostage and say to them that we don't pay ransom—defies logic. So that's point number two. We do not pay ransom. We didn't here. And we don't—we won't in the future, precisely because if we did, then we would start encouraging Americans to be targeted, much in the same way that some countries that do pay ransom end up having a lot more of their citizens being taken by various groups.\nPoint number three is that the timing of this was, in fact, dictated by the fact that as a consequence of us negotiating around the nuclear deal, we actually had diplomatic negotiations and conversations with Iran for the first time in several decades. So the issue is not so much that it was a coincidence as it is that we were able to have a direct discussion.\nJohn Kerry could meet with the Foreign Minister, which meant that our ability to clear accounts on a number of different issues at the same time converged. And it was important for us to take advantage of that opportunity both to deal with this litigation risk that had been raised—it was important for us to make sure that we finished the job on the Iran nuclear deal—and since we were in a conversation with them, it was important for us to be able to push them hard in getting these Americans out.\nAnd let me make a final point on this. It's now been well over a year since the agreement with Iran to stop its nuclear program was signed. And by all accounts, it has worked exactly the way we said it was going to work. You will recall that there were all these horror stories about how Iran was going to cheat and this wasn't going to work and Iran was going to get $150 billion to finance terrorism and all these kinds of scenarios, and none of them have come to pass. And it's not just the assessment of our intelligence community, it's the assessment of the Israeli military and intelligence community—the country that was most opposed to this deal—that acknowledges this has been a game changer and that Iran has abided by the deal and that they no longer have the sort of short-term breakout capacity that would allow them to develop nuclear weapons.\nSo what I'm interested in is, if there's some news to be made, why not have some of these folks who were predicting disaster say, you know what, this thing actually worked? [Laughter] Now, that would be a shock. [Laughter] That would be impressive, if some of these folks who had said the sky is falling suddenly said, you know what, we were wrong, and we are glad that Iran no longer has the capacity to break out in short term and develop a nuclear weapon. But of course, that wasn't going to happen.\nInstead, what we have is the manufacturing of outrage in a story that we disclosed in January. And the only bit of news that is relevant on this is the fact that we paid cash, which brings me to my last point. The reason that we had to give them cash is precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with Iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.\nAnd it is not at all clear to me why it is that cash, as opposed to a check or a wire transfer, has made this into a news story. Maybe because it kind of feels like some spy novel or some crime novel because cash was exchanged. The reason cash was exchanged is because we don't have a banking relationship with Iran, which is precisely part of the pressure that we were able to apply to them so that they would ship a whole bunch of nuclear material out and close down a bunch of facilities that, as I remember, 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 5 years ago, was people's top fear and priority, that we make sure Iran doesn't have breakout nuclear capacity. They don't. This worked.\nJosh Lederman [Associated Press].\n2016 Presidential Election/U.S. Electoral System\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. Repeatedly now, Donald Trump has said that this election will be rigged against him, challenging really the core foundation of our democratic system. Can you promise the American people that this election will be conducted in a fair way? And are you worried that comments like his could erode the public's faith in the outcome of the election? And if he does win, given that you have just declared him \"unfit,\" what will you say to the American people?\nThe President. Well, at the end of the day, it's the American people's decision. I have one vote. I have the same vote you do. I have the vote that all the voters who are eligible all across the country have. I've offered my opinion, but ultimately, it's the American people's decision to make collectively. And if somebody wins the election and they are President, then my constitutional responsibility is to peacefully transfer power to that individual and do everything I can to help them succeed.\nIt is—I don't even really know where to start on answering this question. [Laughter] Of course, the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean? [Laughter] The Federal Government doesn't run the election process. States and cities and communities all across the country, they are the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting booths. And if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country, including in places like Texas, where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths, that's ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense. And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.\nNow, we do take seriously—as we always do—our responsibilities to monitor and preserve the integrity of the voting process. If we see signs that a voting machine or system is vulnerable to hacking, then we inform those local authorities who are running the elections that they need to be careful. If we see jurisdictions that are violating Federal laws in terms of equal access and aren't providing ramps for disabled voters or are discriminating in some fashion or are otherwise violating civil rights laws, then the Justice Department will come in and take care of that.\nBut this will be an election like every other election. And I think all of us at some points in our lives have played sports or maybe just played in a schoolyard or a sandbox. And sometimes, folks, if they lose, they start complaining that they got cheated. But I've never heard of somebody complaining about being cheated before the game was over or before the score is even tallied. So my suggestion would be go out there and try to win the election.\nIf Mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on election day and ends up losing, then maybe he can raise some questions. [Laughter] That doesn't seem to be the case at the moment.\nBarbara Starr [CNN].\n2016 Presidential Election/Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization/U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. On the question of ISIS expansion that you've been talking about, because you see them expanding around the world, because you see them trying to inspire attacks, what is your current level of concern about the homeland? You talked about the protection measures, but what is your assessment about the possibility—your own intelligence advisers suggest it's possible—about the direct ISIS threat to Americans? And if I may follow up, somewhat along the same lines, what is your assessment today as you stand here about whether Donald Trump can be trusted with America's nuclear weapons?\nThe President. On your second question—and I'll sort of address this to any additional Trump questions—[laughter]—I would ask all of you to just make your own judgment. I've made this point already multiple times. Just listen to what Mr. Trump has to say and make your own judgment with respect to how confident you feel about his ability to manage things like our nuclear triad.\nQ. With respect, sir, it suggests that you're not confident.\nThe President. Well, as I recall, I just answered a question about this a couple days ago, and I thought I made myself pretty clear. And I don't want to just keep on repeating it or a variation on it. I obviously have a very strong opinion about the two candidates who are running here. One is very positive, and one is not so much.[Laughter] And I think that you will just hear—any further questions that are directed at this subject, I think you'll hear pretty much variations on the same theme.\nWhat I can say is that this is serious business. And the person who is in the Oval Office and who our Secretary of Defense and our Joint Chiefs of Staff and our outstanding men and women in uniform report to, they are counting on somebody who has the temperament and good judgment to be able to make decisions to keep America safe. And that should be very much on the minds of voters when they go into the voting booth in November. In terms of the threat that ISIL poses to the homeland, I think it is serious. We take it seriously. And as I said earlier, precisely because they are less concerned about big, spectacular 9/11-style attacks, because they've seen the degree of attention they can get with smaller scale attacks using small arms or assault rifles or, in the case of Nice, France, a truck, the possibility of either a lone actor or a small cell carrying out an attack that kills people is real.\nAnd that's why our intelligence and law enforcement and military officials are working around the clock to try to anticipate potential attacks, to obtain the threads of people who might be vulnerable to brainwashing by ISIL. We are constrained here in the United States to carry out this work in a way that's consistent with our laws and presumptions of innocence. And the fact that we prevent a lot of these attacks as effectively as we do, without a lot of fanfare and abiding by our law, is a testament to the incredible work that these folks are doing. They work really hard at it. But it is always a risk.\nAnd I—some of you may have read the article in the New York Times today—I guess it came out last night online—about this individual in Germany who had confessed and given himself up and then explained his knowledge of how ISIL's networks worked. There was a paragraph in there that some may have caught, which we don't know for a fact that this is true, but according to this reporting, the individual indicated that ISIL recognizes it's harder to get its operatives into the United States, but the fact that we have what he referred to as \"open gun laws\" meant that anybody, as long as they didn't have a criminal record that barred them from purchase, could go in and buy weapons, that made, sort of, a homegrown extremist strategy more attractive to them. And those are the hardest to stop because, by definition, if somebody doesn't have a record, if it's not triggering something, it means that anticipating their actions becomes that much more difficult.\nAnd this is why the military strategy that we have in Syria and Iraq is necessary, but it is not sufficient. We have to do a better job of disrupting networks. And those networks are more active in Europe than they are here. But we don't know what we don't know, and so it's conceivable that there are some networks here that could be activated. But we also have to get to the messaging that can reach a troubled individual over the Internet and do a better job of disrupting that. And what I've told my team is that, although we've been working on this now for 5, 6, 7 years, we've got to put more resources into it. This is—can't be an afterthought. It's something that we have to really focus on.\nThis is also why how we work with the Muslim American community, the values that we affirm about their patriotism and their sacrifice and our fellow feeling with them is so important. One of the reasons that we don't have networks and cells that are as active here as they are in certain parts of Europe is because the Muslim American community in this country is extraordinarily patriotic and largely successful and fights in our military and serves as our doctors and our nurses and there are communities in which they are raising their kids with love of country and a rejection of violence. And that has to be affirmed consistently. And when—if we screw that up, then we're going to have bigger problems.\nGregory Korte of USA Today. There you go.\nCriminal Justice Reform/Presidential Pardons and Commutations\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday you commuted the sentences of 214 Federal inmates. It was the largest single-day grant of commutations in the history of the American Presidency. So I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about your clemency——\nThe President. Initiative. Yes. Q. ——thought process.\nOne is, you've talked about this as low-level drug offenders who got mandatory minimum sentences, but about a quarter of the commutations you've granted also had firearms offenses. Given your overall philosophy on firearms, can you reconcile that for us?\nThe President. Sure.\nQ. And given that previously in your Presidency you had sent a memo to the Office of Pardon Attorney saying there was sort of a predisposition against firearms to be carrying a clemency, why did you change your mind on that?\nThe President. Good.\nQ. Also, the other side of the ledger here is pardons. You've granted more commutations than any President since Calvin Coolidge. You've granted fewer pardons than any two-term President since John Adams. Why is that? Is the focus on commutations taking energy away from pardons, especially since these are—you've talked about second chances; a full pardon would give people a better chance at those second chances.\nThe President. Good.\nQ. And then finally, just one other thing on pardons. Many of your predecessors in the final days of their Presidency have saved—reserved that for their more politically sensitive pardons.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. Should we expect you to do that? Or would you rule that out? Thanks.\nThe President. Okay. No, I appreciate the question, Gregory, because I haven't had a chance to talk about this much and this is an effort that I'm really proud of.\nIt is my view, shared by Democrats and Republicans alike in many quarters, that as successful as we've been in reducing crime in this country, the extraordinary rate of incarceration of nonviolent offenders has created its own set of problems that are devastating. Entire communities have been ravaged where largely men, but some women, are taken out of those communities. Kids are now growing up without parents. It perpetuates a cycle of poverty and disorder in their lives. It is disproportionately young men of color that are being arrested at higher rates, charged and convicted at higher rates, and imprisoned for longer sentences.\nAnd so ultimately, the fix on this is criminal justice reform. And I still hold out hope that the bipartisan effort that's taken place in Congress can finish the job and we can have a criminal justice system, at least at the Federal level, that is both smart on crime, effective on crime, but recognizes the need for proportionality in sentencing and the need to rehabilitate those who commit crimes.\nBut even as that slow process of criminal justice reform goes forward, what I wanted to see is if we could reinvigorate the pardon process and commutation process that had become stalled over the course of several years, partly because it's politically risky. You commute somebody, and they commit a crime, and the politics of it are tough. And everybody remembers the Willie Horton ad.\nAnd so the bias, I think, of my predecessors and, frankly, a number of my advisers early in my Presidency is, be careful about that. But I thought it was very important for us to send a clear message that we believe in the principles behind criminal justice reform even if ultimately we need legislation.\nSo we have focused more on commutations than we have on pardons. I would argue, Gregory, that by the time I leave office, the number of pardons that we grant will be roughly in line with what other Presidents have done. But standing up this commutations process has required a lot of effort and a lot of energy, and it's not like we got a new slug of money to do it. So you've got limited resources. The primary job of the Justice Department is to prevent crime and to convict those who have committed crimes and to keep the American people safe. And that means that you've had this extraordinary and Herculean effort by a lot of people inside the Justice Department to go above and beyond what they're doing to also review these petitions that have been taking place. And we've been able to get bar organizations around the country to participate, to kind of screen and help people apply.\nAnd what we've—the main criteria that I've tried to set is, if under today's laws—because there have been changes in how we charge nonviolent drug offenses—if under today's charges, their sentences would be substantially lower than the charges that they received, if they got a life sentence, but a U.S. attorney or the Justice Department indicates that today they'd be likely to get 20 years and they've already served 25, then what we try to do is to screen through and find those individuals who have paid their debt to society, that have behaved themselves and tried to reform themselves while incarcerated and think—we think have a good chance of being able to use that second chance well.\nOn the firearms issue, what I've done is to try to screen out folks who seem to have a propensity for violence. And so—and these are just hypotheticals, but there may be a situation where a kid at 18 was a member of a gang, had a firearm, did not use it in the offense that he was charged in, there's no evidence that he used it in any violent offense, it's still a firearms charge in enhancement, but he didn't use it. He's now 48—or 38, 20 years later, and has a unblemished prison record, has gone back to school, gotten his GED, has gone through drug treatment, has the support of the original judge that presided, the support of the U.S. attorney that charged him, support of the warden, has a family that loves him. And in that situation, the fact that he had, 20 years earlier, an enhancement because he had a firearm is different than a situation where somebody has engaged in armed robbery and shot somebody. In those cases, that is still something that I'm concerned about.\nOur focus really has been on people who we think were overcharged and people who we do not believe have a propensity towards violence.\nAnd in terms of your last question about sort of last-minute pardons that are granted, the process that I put in place is not going to vary depending on how close I get to the election. So it's going to be reviewed by the Pardon Attorney, it will be reviewed by my White House Counsel, and I'm going to, as best as I can, make these decisions based on the merits, as opposed to political considerations. Okay?\nAnd finally, Jim Miklaszewski is retiring after 30 years at NBC. He has done an outstanding job, mostly covering the Department of Defense. This may be my last press conference here, so I just wanted to thank Jim for the extraordinary career that he's had and the great job that he's done. And he gets the last question.\nQ. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nThe President. You bet. Terrorism/U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy\nQ. First, back to ISIS and Iraq and Syria, your very own national counterterrorism operation has found that despite all of the decisive defeats that the U.S. and coalition have dealt ISIS on the battlefield, that they've expanded their threat worldwide to include as many as 18 operational bases. In the 6 years you've been dealing, do you feel any personal disappointment that there hasn't been more progress? And in any discussions you've had with the U.S. military and your intelligence agencies, have you come up with any new ideas on how to deal or defeat ISIS?\nThe President. Every time there is a terrorist attack, I feel disappointment, because I'd like to prevent all of them. And that's true not just when the attacks are in Europe or in the United States. When you read stories about attacks in Lebanon or Iraq or Afghanistan or distant parts of the world that don't get as much attention, they get my attention, because that's somebody's kid and that's somebody's mom and that's somebody who was just going about his business, and mindlessly, senselessly, this person was murdered.\nSo I haven't gotten numb to it. It bugs me whenever it happens and wherever it happens. And we are constantly pushing ourselves to see, are there additional ideas that we can deploy to defeat this threat?\nNow, it is important that we recognize, terrorism as a tactic has been around for a long time. And if you look at the seventies or the eighties or the nineties, there was some terrorist activity somewhere in the world that was brutal. And as much as I would like to say that during my 8-year Presidency, we could have eliminated terrorism completely, it's not surprising that that hasn't happened, and I don't expect that will happen under the watch of my successors.\nI do think that because of our extraordinary efforts, the homeland is significantly safer than it otherwise would be. Now, some—in some ways, this is arguing the counterfactuals, but the attacks we prevent I take great satisfaction in, and I am grateful for the extraordinary work that our teams do. I don't think there's any doubt that had we not destroyed Al Qaida in the FATA that more Americans would have been killed, and we might have seen more attacks like we saw on 9/11. And we have maintained vigilance, recognizing that those threats still remain, those aspirations in the minds of these folks still remain, but it is much harder for them to carry out large-scale attacks like that than it used to be.\nWhat we have seen is that these lower level attacks carried out by fewer operatives or an individual with less sophisticated and less expensive weapons can do real damage. And that, I think, points to the need for us to not just have a military strategy, not just have a traditional counterterrorism strategy that's designed to bust up networks and catch folks before they carry out their attacks—although those still are necessary, and we have to be more and more sophisticated about how we carry those out; it still requires us to have much greater cooperation with our partners around the world—but it points to the fact that we're going to have to do a better job in draining the ideology that is behind these attacks; that right now is emanating largely out of the Middle East and a very small fraction of the Muslim world a perversion of Islam that has taken root and has been turbocharged over the Internet; and that is appealing to even folks who don't necessarily know anything about Islam and aren't even practicing Islam in any serious way, but have all kinds of psychosis and latch on to this as some way of being important and magnifying themselves.\nAnd that's tougher because that involves both changes in geopolitics in places like Syria. It requires cultural changes in regions like the Middle East and North Africa that are going through generational changes and shifts as the old order collapses. It requires psychology and thinking about how do these messages of hate reach individuals and are there ways in which we can intervene ahead of time. And all that work is being done. And we've got the very best people at it, and each day, they're making a difference in saving lives, not just here, but around the world.\nBut it's a challenge precisely because if you're successful 99 percent of the time, that 1 percent can still mean heartbreak for families. And it's difficult because in a country, let's say, of 300 million people here in the United States, if 99.9 percent of people are immune from this hateful ideology, but one-tenth of 1 percent are susceptible to it, that's a lot of dangerous people running around. And we can't always anticipate them ahead of time because they may not have criminal records. So this is going to be a challenge.\nI just want to end on the point that I made earlier. How we react to this is as important as the efforts we take to destroy ISIL, prevent these networks from penetrating. You can't separate those two things out. The reason it's called terrorism, as opposed to just a standard war, is that these are weak enemies that can't match us in conventional power, but what they can do is make us scared. And when it make—and when societies get scared, they can react in ways that undermine the fabric of our society. It makes us weaker and makes us more vulnerable and creates politics that divide us in ways that hurt us over the long term.\nAnd so if we remain steady and steadfast and vigilant, but also take the long view and maintain perspective and remind ourselves of who we are and what we care about most deeply, and what we cherish and what's good about this country and what's good about the international order and civilization that was built in part because of the sacrifices of our men and women after a 20th century full of world war—if we remember that—then we're going to be okay. But we're still going to see, episodically, these kinds of tragedies, and we're going to have to keep working on it until we make things better. All right?\nQ. If I may, Mr. President——\nThe President. You may, only because this is your retirement.\nQ. I was hoping you'd respond——\nThe President. But I hope it's not too long because——\nQ. No, no, it's short——\nThe President. ——I'm going to be late for my birthday dinner. [Laughter]\nQ. Oh. Happy birthday, by the way.\nThe President. Thank you.\nSyria/Russia-U.S. Relations\nQ. You alluded earlier to the negotiations between the U.S. and Russia over some military-to-military cooperation in Syria against some of the militant forces there, presumably in exchange for whatever Russian influence could be imposed on the Asad regime for a variety of reasons.\nThe President. Right. Q. Now, you—I'm sure you're not surprised that some in the military are not supportive of that deal. Some European allies think it would be a deal with the devil. What makes you so confident that you can trust the Russians and Vladimir Putin?\nThe President. I'm not confident that we can trust the Russians and Vladimir Putin, which is why we have to test whether or not we can get an actual cessation of hostilities that includes an end to the kinds of aerial bombing and civilian death and destruction that we've seen carried out by the Asad regime. And Russia may not be able to get there either because they don't want to or because they don't have sufficient influence over Asad. And that's what we're going to test.\nSo we go into this without any blinders on. We're very clear that Russia has been willing to support a murderous regime that has—and an individual, in Asad, who has destroyed his country just to cling on to power. What started with peaceful protests has led to a shattering of an entire and pretty advanced society. And so whenever you're trying to broker any kind of deal with an individual like that or a country like that, you've got to go in there with some skepticism.\nOn the other hand, if we are able to get a genuine cessation of hostilities that prevents indiscriminate bombing, that protects civilians, that allows humanitarian access and creates some sort of pathway to begin the hard work of political negotiations inside of Syria, then we have to try, because the alternative is a perpetuation of civil war.\nI've been wrestling with this now for a lot of years. I am pretty confident that a big chunk of my gray hair comes out of my Syria meetings. [Laughter] And there is not a meeting that I don't end by saying, is there something else we could be doing that we haven't thought of. Is there a plan F, G, H that we think would lead to a resolution of this issue so that the Syrian people can put their lives back together again and we can bring peace and relieve the refugee crisis that's taken place? And the options are limited when you have a civil war like this, when you have a ruler who doesn't care about his people, when you've got terrorist organizations that are brutal and would impose their own kind of dictatorship on people, and you have a moderate opposition and ordinary civilians who are often outgunned and outmanned. And that's a very difficult situation to deal with. But we've got to give it a chance.\nThere are going to be some bottom lines that we expect for us to cooperate with Russia beyond the sort of deconfliction that we're currently doing. And that means restraint on the part of the regime that so far has not been forthcoming.\nEarly on in this version of the cessation of hostilities, we probably saw some lives saved and some lessening of violence. The violations of this cessation have grown to the point where it just barely exists, particularly up in the northwestern part of the country. So we're going to test and see if we can get something that sticks. And if not, then Russia will have shown itself very clearly to be an irresponsible actor on the world stage that is supporting a murderous regime and will have to be—will have to answer to that on the international stage.\nAll right?

Special. He is a special man and special person. And he has become my friend. Oh, there is a lot of people here. Whoa. [applause]\nHello, everybody. Your football team is going to have a great year. [applause]\nI watch. I watch. You've got the quarterback, you've got the whole deal. I think it's going to be a very good year. [applause]\nOK? And if you get into that Super Bowl, I will be going, all right?\nSo, you know, I wrote something down before, and I think it is important, because -- I love you too. [applause]\nBecause we need unity, we have to win this election. This is truly one of the most important elections, certainly in my lifetime. Because we are about to go -- we lose it, we are in the wrong direction, and maybe it's gone. Supreme Court justices, always remember that. But so many different levels, and when you see what happened with crooked Hillary today, it was a disaster. [applause]\nA disaster. She had a disaster. She lies folks, she lies badly. [applause]\nSo, I want to -- I just wrote this out. I wanted to say to the group, you know, I had a great time when I was in Wisconsin, and I did not quite eke it out. I thought I was going to, but after that, it worked out well. You built me up, you taught me about politics.\nAnd when I left here, I said, I think I've learned a lot. [applause]\nSo, I love it. I love the people. I have many friends in Wisconsin. And they're -- they're incredible people. You're incredible people, I have to tell you that. [applause]\nAnd we're going to have a lot of fun. We are going to have a lot of fun but I had to write this. This campaign is not about me or any one candidate. It is about America. [applause]\nIt is time for a change. We need a change. A real change, not an Obama change. We don't need an Obama change. We have had enough. It is time to change a rigged political system that works only for the insiders, and replace it with a government that serves the people. [applause]\nHave to do it. And know both sides. I've been on the other side. Believe me. I actually like this side better; this is a movement. This is a movement like they may be have never seen in this country, according to even the political pundits that truly hate me, OK? This is a -- they -- oh, this is a movement that some say, most say is one of the great phenomenon's that they've ever seen in politics.\nSome say it's the single greatest phenomenon. [applause]\nThough the media doesn't want to talk about it, we have done something -- we. All of us, together. I'm a messenger; I'm only a messenger. We have done something truly historic together, standing before you as nominee for president and I'm not a politician, proudly. [applause]\nI'm not part of the system. I ran against the system, and I'm probably better off running against the system. [applause]\nI ran against the donors. I'm my own donor, essentially. I have a lot of money under this deal. This is a very expensive crisis, I want to tell you. [laughter]\nI funded -- as you know, I funded the primaries. And I'm in for under $60 million, and I'm largely funding my campaign as we go forward. In addition to that -- in addition to that, we have raised tremendous amounts of money, and much of it from small donors,$61; $61. As a Republican, that doesn't happen. It happens because of what you are seeing in front of you today.\nAnd if you remember, just prior to June, they did a story, \"Donald Trump has not really done too well with fund raising.\" Well, that is because I did not even know if I was getting the nomination. I'm not going to raise funds -- I would've had enough if I didn't make it. I would have said, \"Bye, bye, politics.\"\nBut I wanted to make sure -- so I got it. And then I started raising money for the Republican Party. and we raised a lot of money. We started really on June 14th, Flag Day, my birthday. My birthday. [applause]\nAnd in June, we raised approximately -- think of this -- $51 million. Can you imagine? [applause]\nAnd those people couldn't believe it; they were really surprised. Big headlines, you know. Because they don't give me too many good headlines. I could do the greatest things. I do things that I think a fantastic.\nI say, good, there is no way they cover this badly. And they cover it badly. I gently tell a woman that I love her baby, and let the baby cry. It is OK. As the baby that had a voice that was superior to Pavarotti continued to cry -- I remember, I told her to stay, don't worry, ma'am.\nBut after about 3 or 4 minutes, and I'm trying to speak and it was in Jacksonville, we had this massive, massive crowd, filled up the stadium. And the baby's screaming. So, I said, ma'am, I would like to reverse my order. Perhaps you could nicely take -- take the baby out. Your baby is great\nI did it so nicely. She was happy. Even the baby was happy. He stopped crying. [applause]\nAnd maybe you could take the baby out, would that be possible? The whole place was cracking up. And the next day in the newspaper, it said, \"Trump throws baby out of arena.\"\nTerrible. Now, they are very dishonest. That was a tough one, when I -- and I just had a reporter come up to me, backstage, a reporter come up -- \"Mr. Trump, sir, but why did you throw that baby out of the area?\" I said, \"I was having fun. I was so nice, I was so nice. Everybody likes me. The baby liked me, the mother liked me. We had a good time. I try to keep the baby in, but the baby was such -- had such a powerful voice [applause]\nIn fact, I want to find out who that baby is, because I want to sponsor the baby. And that baby will sing someday in Philharmonic Hall. I'm telling you. New York City. OK? The great Philharmonic. [applause]\nSo, I'm not part of the system. I ran against the system. I ran against the donors, because I'm largely my own donor. I'm running against myself. That's sort of -- never thought of it that way. And against the status quo, and the status quo, we have to get rid of, because it is not working, folks, because the country is a mess. [applause]\nAnd that is why put up a lot of money. But while the Democrats nominated the candidate of special interests, and really a candidate of total corruption, I mean, you take a look at what she is doing, the Republicans made history by choosing a nominee from outside of this very, very corrupt the system. It is a corrupt system.\nIt's a corrupt system. You want something done, they can do it for you. And that is not necessarily, and usually it isn't good for the country.\nThat is why we're going to be able to deliver real change, and real safety and real opportunity to all Americans. We have to unite. Remember that.\nEverything I've accomplished, I have done by putting together a really fantastic team, including Governor Mike Pence of Indiana, who has done an incredible... [applause]\nDone an incredible job. My wonderful staff of people that really love what we are doing, and they are working so hard. My family, friends, and it's expanding all the time.\nBut I need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make. We have to make them, right? [applause]\nI understand and embrace the wisdom of Ronald Reagan's big tent within the party, big, big tent, remember? Ronald Reagan, great man, great guy. Remember he included Reagan Democrats and Independents and Republicans, a lot of people. We're going to have the same thing. There a lot of Democrats perhaps in this room, are there a lot of Democrats? Raise your hands. I mean, I don't think we need too many to be honest with you, but -- so I embraced the wisdom that my 80 percent friend is not my 20 percent enemy, Ronald Reagan. [applause]\nStated by Ronald Reagan, pretty good.\nWe will be the big tent party. We are going to have a lot of cross help. We are going to have a lot of Bernie Sanders people coming in because of trade, because Bernie Sanders knew we were being ripped off by trade. Trade is a disaster with China, with Japan, with Mexico, with Vietnam, with so many countries, with every country, every country.\nWe don't win at any level with anything, and as a unified party, we will lead our country to unity as well, very important. We need the unity, we have to win the election. [applause]\nNo we have to win it --- have to win it. Otherwise, our big movement was not as big as we thought and that's not good. That's why November 8th, you've got to get everybody you know -- and you know, all this voter ID nowadays, a lot of places aren't going to have voter ID. Now what does that mean? What does that mean? You just keep walking in and voting? So you have to be very careful, very vigilant -- you have to be careful\nBut we will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory, and very importantly, toward real change. [applause]\nSo in our shared mission to make America great again, I support and endorse our speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. [applause]\nPaul Ryan, he's good. He's a good man. He's a good man and he's a good guy. And we may disagree on a couple of things, but mostly we agree and we're going get it done and we're going to do a lot of wonderful things. [applause]\nHe's a good man. And while I'm at it, I hold in the highest esteem Senator John McCain for his service to our country, in uniform and in public office, and I fully support and endorse his re-election. Very important. [applause]\nWe'll work together. I also fully support and endorse Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. [applause]\nA state I truly love, primarily because that was my first victory, but I love New Hampshire. No, I love New Hampshire, one of the most beautiful places. She's a rising star and will continue to represent the great people of New Hampshire so very well for a long, long time. Senator Kelly Ayotte. [applause]\nWorking hand-in-hand, we will grow our majority in the House and in the Senate. We need that, we've got to get things done. Arm in arm, we will rescue the nation from the Obama-Clinton disaster, which is exactly what it is, that has bled our country dry and spread terrorism unabated across the world, that's what's happening. You saw it just now, Maps came out yesterday, they said ISIS far bigger, it's all over the place. It's all over the place. We're going to get rid of it, folks. [applause]\nOur military is depleted. We're going to build up our military, we are going to get others with us. Believe me, we're going to get plenty of others with us. And speaking of others, wouldn't it actually be wonderful if we could get along with Russia? Wouldn't that be nice? [applause]\nThey talk so big and so brave and so tough, they're the tough ones. You know, Hillary's real tough, give me a break. Wouldn't that be great? We get along with Russia, we go out together with others and we knock the hell out of ISIS, wouldn't that be great? [applause]\nTogether we will lead our country back to prosperity, security and peace. OK? When you look at the world and what's happened -- so we have the queen of corruption, she's the queen of corruption. She is a disaster. I said before, if crooked Hillary Clinton becomes president, terrorism will destroy the inner workings of our country. Believe me, they are loving it.\nShe wants to have 550 percent more people coming in from Syria and that region into our nation. And we don't know who they are, we don't know where they come from really, we don't know if they're ISIS, some will be. And look at the damage that's done in San Bernardino with a couple -- probably he became radicalized by her -- a couple, and these were friends of theirs. These were people that gave a party in celebration of the birth of their child and they were gunned down, 14 people killed, many, many injured.\nTake a look at Orlando -- take a look at Orlando, how disgusting that was. Take a look at the World Trade Center and so many other places. Go to the probably toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, go to Paris and take a look at that, 130 people gunned down. You know, if people had guns, on the other side where the bullets are flying in the other direction, like you sir, you sir, you and you, ma'am. [applause]\nFirst of all, if they knew guns were in the room, they probably wouldn't have gone there. There were no guns. They were just sitting ducks, 130 people. In San Bernardino you had 14 people.\nBut in Paris, just like this, boom -- get over here, boom -- get over here, boom -- 130 people with many still in the hospital, many so gravely wounded. It's horrible. And if they had bullets flying in the other direction, maybe they wouldn't have shown up, and if they did, I'll tell you what, you wouldn't have had that kind of carnage. You would have had people lying on the other side of the floor instead. [applause]\nSo Hillary Clinton wants to do major damage, as you know, to our Second Amendment. Hillary Clinton wants to put judges -- she wants to put justices of the Supreme Court -- she's going to make them nice and liberal, wait until -- wait until you see what that does to your rights. Wait until you see what that does to your Second Amendment. You will not recognize it, you will not recognize it. National Rifle Association, NRA, endorsed me. [applause]\nThey're great people, Wayne -- they're great people, Chris, they love this country. They endorsed me very early and it's really a -- it's really an honor. I'll tell you what, they are phenomenal people when you get to know them. They love the country -- you know, they love the country. They take a lot of heat, but they love the country, I'll tell you that right now.\nAnd I heard Mike, Governor Pence, talking about 1.2 growth -- 1.2 percent growth, the lowest in memory since the 1940's. When you think about it, it's the lowest. So a lot of differences between all of us, but I thought I would mention -- because I've known Hillary Clinton over the years -- I know her -- and she makes statements. She makes statements and they are statements coming out of her playbook.\nWell, let's see, \"we can't get them for this -- can't get them for this.\" I've always heard that I have the best temperament, people tell me I have the best temperament, I have a temperament to win. We got to win. We got to win[applause]\nShe said not so long ago, \"I don't like Donald Trump's tone\". Now, she is reading it off teleprompters only. \"I don't like Donald trump's tone.\" And I said, you know, \"we need a tough tone today. We have people -- we need a kind tone, but we need a tough tone.\"\nWe have people being beheaded all over the Middle East and other places. We have crime that is rampant. We have people in the Middle East being drowned in steel cages. This is like medieval times, and she is worried about my tone.\nSo they chop off heads and they drown people, and they bury people in sand. And then they ask me, \"Mr. Trump, sir,\" -- at one of the debates in which I won, I'm very happy about that -- \"Mr. Trump, sir, how do you feel about waterboarding?\" I'm seeing chopped off heads, drowned people, burying in sand -- I said, \"I'm absolutely OK with it, let me tell you.\" [applause]\nCan you imagine what the enemy must say -- can you imagine the enemy -- ISIS in this case -- can you imagine what they must say as they spent the day chopping off the heads of Christians -- \"come back, get together and start talking -- and they say waterboarding is not allowed in the United States -- by the United States, waterboarding is not allowed.\"\nFolks, we better get smart and tough and we are playing games with Hillary, we are playing games. It is just games, she is not the right person and everybody knows it. Her single greatest achievement is being caught in a crime and getting away with it. [applause]\nThis is true, 33,000 e-mails. [applause]\nSo I wrote this before on the way over to another rally at also a very nice place that's very full and very nice in Iowa. And we love Iowa don't we, yes? Right? [applause]\nI thought it was accurate, unstable -- and she is, she is unstable. Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment that Bernie Sanders had. You just have to pay attention, as soon as he said it, I started writing notes. [applause]\n\"She has bad judgment. She lacks the judgment, temperament and moral character to lead this country. Plus, she is a weak person.\" We don't need a weak person. He just said, \"plus, she is a criminal.\"\nShe is a dangerous liar who has disregarded the lives of Americans, and who has put all of us at great risk while supporting economic policies that have destroyed our economy. We have a long way to go.\nShe is unhinged, she's truly unhinged, and she is unbalanced, totally unbalanced. And you can see, in the words of a secret service agent who just wrote a book, I bought the book, I wanted to see what he had to say; \"she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office.\"\n\"From my bottom of my soul\" he said, \"I know this to be true.\" He was there. \"Her leadership style, volcanic impulsive as it is, disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasn't changed a bit. She's unqualified to become president.\" And she really is, and Bernie said that too. [applause]\nThank you. What great people. Wow.\nNo, but it is true, no games, it is true. In one way she is a monster, OK? Look at what happened, look at her history. In another way, she is a weak person, she is actually not strong enough to be president. So she's got both, but she is not strong enough to be president.\nShe will be a be a disaster. She will be so bad for our country, and I'm not just talking about Justices of the Supreme Court. She will be so bad for our country and we can't let it happen. We can't let it happen.\nYou know, Mike Pence told me a story, and maybe I should not say it, but I found it interesting, but of the reasons -- I guess the primary reason that he's in politics is because he watched the crookedness of the Clintons when they were in the White House. And he said \"he ran, he ran again and he ran again, and he won.\" You have to hand it to him, this is the guy that does not give up. He does not quit. He never ever quits. [applause]\nBut he watched the Clintons -- and I'm sure they will be thrilled to hear that -- but that actually got him into politics, which is interesting.\nSo then we make these horrible deals; Iran Deal, horrible deal, we got $150 billion -- and how about $400 million -- think of it, $400 million in cash, different currencies, different denominations. Now, lot of people say that money went toward terror\nI'm nicer than that, see, I don't have that horrible thought process that some people have in this room have. I say, some of it went to terror, but a lot of it went into their bank accounts, believe me, that's the way it is. It went into their pockets, can you imagine these guys sitting there with $400 million in cash? You think they're giving that money to terror, they are giving that money to them and I guess terror got some of it, but most of it they kept.\nI mean, the concept of paying $400 million in cash is mind- boggling. I mean, you wouldn't think -- who can authorize such a thing? Where did they get it? What did they do, go to a bank teller and say, \"give me $400 million in cash? I want to in euros, I want it in Swiss francs, wrap it up, we will come back in 10 minutes.\"\nI mean, it is just inconceivable. So we are witnessing a horror show in this country and throughout the world. You look at what is going on throughout the world with these same people, these people funding terror -- these people are funding terrorism. For us to have given $400 million to basically free our hostages.\nNow, Obama, just like he lied about Obamacare which was a tremendous lie, that was a tremendous lie, remember? \"You can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor.\" Really? How many people have been able to keep the doctor or their plan?\nKeep your plan, keep your doctor -- not working that way, folks. It is a disaster. By the way, it is going to be repealed and replaced 100 percent. [applause]\nAnd -- and honestly, I hope I win, because we will do a great job. We are going to make America great again. We're going to make America great again. [applause]\nBut I actually think that regardless of who wins, Obamacare is going to fold in any event. It is so expensive. People can't afford it and the country can't afford it. Other than that, it is just wonderful. So, in Texas, they just had almost a 60 percent increase. Now the increases are starting to come out. The big increase is going to be announced on November 1st. The election is November 8th. Folks, they want to delay it, because it is election-changing. It is a mess.\nIt is election changing, and they want to change it. And we can't let that happen.\nBecause the numbers -- and I can see some of the numbers already -- the numbers are going to be astronomical. They are going to be astronomical. They're going to be so big, so horrible, and the health care, you know, the plan is terrible. It's terrible. And we're going to take care of everybody, but we're going to end up with a great plan that costs much less money for the people and much less money for the country.\nThis plan is a total rip. It does not work, so it's going to fall, because economically, it is a disaster for the country, too.\nBut what about people where they said they had a 30, 40, 50, 60 percent increase? And it's going to be worse than that, I predict on November 1st.\nSo, we'd better get smart and we'd better start thinking properly.\nNow, I want to talk about what is going on at the borders, because money... [applause]\nOh, we're going to build it.\nSo, listen, so we have people coming to our country that should not be coming to our country . We have thousands and thousands of people from certain terrorist states, from certain parts of the world that we are allowing to come into our country.\nMost of the politicians, almost all of them don't even know where they are, where they are being put, they know nothing about these people. This could be the great Trojan Horse of all time. And Hillary wants thousands more to come in over and above Obama. Right?\nSo, tall -- and the wall is getting taller every day. [applause]\nIf you think of this, I just wrote this, the Obama-Clinton foreign-policy has handed huge portions of Iraq, Libya and Syria to ISIS. Huge portions. It has undermined stability in Egypt, and you know what they have to do over there. And empowered Iran as never before. Iran, three years ago was -- was dying. In fact, when they were marching in the streets, if Obama would have just encouraged them a little more, it would have been taken over by the people.\nBut Obama played ball with the thugs that are running it right now. Think of this, think of this. Look, look. We're making a deal, and the deal is not made, and they are dancing in the streets of Iran saying how stupid the Americans are to be making this deal.\nThe leaders, and in particular the leader of Iran, is calling us stupid, and the deal means nothing.\nAnd yesterday, I think he just said that the United States is essentially nothing.\nThis is our -- this is our great, great partner.\nBut when you have somebody -- if I was making this deal, and if the other side was bragging about it, the deal wasn't made, I'm not making that deal. I'm not making it. I'm walking.\nBut we kept it going, and we should have never ever started negotiating that deal until we had our hostages back. OK? [applause]\nWe should have walked. We should have doubled up the sanctions and walked. And they would have -- and I say it. Before the plane reached New York City or Washington, you could just turn it around, because they'll call you, they'll say, let's go. Take your hostages.\nBut when you think about it, you probably read today and yesterday, one of the hostages was waiting for a very long period of time. Now, Obama said that it had nothing to do with the hostages. That he would not do that for kidnappers.\nHe would not do that for kidnapping. OK? No, no, think of that. You have got to think about it. He wouldn't do it -- now, it was the same day, right, same day. We have to be exactly accurate, because they'll catch us, right? Same day.\nThe money came in, and one of the hostages, a good guy, I saw him interview on television. Good guy, hard time. Btu didn't he say he waited forever, he waited. And somebody said, nope, we are waiting for either something or a plane to come in.\nAnd here Obama stands up yesterday, and for seven minutes is telling us one thing had nothing to do with the other. Just a lie. You know, at least be truthful. [applause]\nAnd we're talking about the same day, $400 million, and we could have had something that would have been a much better deal. And you know what, I'm all in favor of deals when it gets to nuclear. But we could have made it -- we should have walked. And we should have walked with $150, too; we have said, sorry, we don't have the money, can't pay. We don't have the money. We owe almost $20 trillion\nI'm sorry, fellas, we love you, we think you're the greatest guys on Earth. But we can't give you the money. We don't have it. And they will get angry and they will be upset, and two days later, you'll be back negotiating.\nYou just saved yourself $150 billion, right? Hundred and -- $150 billion. [applause]\nSo, we have terrorists pouring into our country, we have people coming in. I don't know if you saw this, in Maine -- and Maine knows, because Maine is -- I was up there yesterday -- a great place. A great governor, great governor. Paul is doing a great job.\nAnd I think the most important issue facing civilization right now is radical Islamic terrorism. And we have a president that refuses to use the term, and we have crooked Hillary who does not want to use it. Now, she's being forced to use it by me.\nDid you notice she gave a speech, she said, I will use it. She called it, I think, radical Islam. But she said, I will use it. I will. Just like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She called it the gold standard. It is a horror show.\nIt's almost as bad or maybe it's going to worse than NAFTA, signed by her husband, which cleaned out many of the states in our country, cleaned them out from manufacturing. Moved to Mexico and other places. NAFTA, a total disaster.\nNAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton. He never suffered the ravages, because he signed it, then he got out and other people did suffer with it.\nBut we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, and if they don't want to make a great deal for us so we get our jobs back, at least a lot of them, if we can't make a great deal -- and she can't do that, by the way, if she wanted to.\nNumber one, her donors would not let her. Her special interests would never let her. Her lobbyists would never let her.\nNumber three, she could not do it anyway. Even if she wanted to.\nBut we're going to renegotiate. And did you hear her the other day? After years of saying how wonderful it is, even though you look at New England, and you look at New York state and you look at Pennsylvania and Ohio, if you look at a lot of other places, one of the reasons I won Indiana so big -- well, one of the reasons was the great Bobby Knight, OK?\nBobby Knight in Indiana. [applause]\nThat's gold standard right? As she said about TPP. But one of the reasons I won was because Carrier Air Conditioning was moving to Mexico from Indiana, and they let go of 1,400 people.\nAnd I've been talking about this, and I know how to stop it, and you've heard me before, so easy to stop. There have to be consequences when Mexico takes our companies. And not only Mexico; there have to be consequences when China devalues its currency so that our companies can no longer compete with China, even though we make better product.\nI have friends who are manufacturers. We make better product. They can't get their product into China And when a few times arise where they can, they have to pay an incredible tax, beyond what anybody would even think costs. But yet, we open our doors and just throw away your stuff, and we lose our jobs and it is very, very said.\nBut look, as many know, a major destination -- Maine, has become a major destination for Somali refugees. We admit hundreds of thousands of refugees into the United States from many of the most dangerous and unstable regions in the world. And you are getting them here too folks, you just don't know it because you just don't know.\nAnybody in this room -- anybody in this room from a terror territory? All right, a practice -- and this is a practice which will continue under Hillary Clinton except it will expand five, six, seven fold. I don't get it. I mean, I know they will vote Democrat, OK, that's what I know, but they will not be voting for a long time.\nI just -- I don't get it, how can anybody even think this way? Now, the Washington Times reported, \"of the Somali refugees -- the program in Minnesota -- that the effort to resettle large groups of Somali refugees is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state safety net\" -- tremendous problems for safety -- \"and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for the Islamic terror groups\nAren't we smart? We are having this problem across our refugee and immigration programs. Here are some of the examples -- I will give you a few examples, and this came out of the Senate subcommittee just recently. \"The Boston bombers\" -- remember those horrible, disgusting people? \"The Boston bombers arrived through the political asylum process.\nThe younger brother applied for citizenship and was naturalized on September 11, 2012. The older brother had a pending application for citizenship.\" And look what happened, we took them in. Look what happened, aren't we smart?\nThe Moroccan national who came to the United States on a student visa was arrested for plotting to blow up a university in a federal courthouse. Great. A Uzbek refugee living in Idaho was arrested and charged with providing support to a terrorist organization in the form of teaching terror recruits how to build massive and very dangerous bombs. We let him in.\nAn immigrant from Syria who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was accused by federal prosecutors of planning to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers, execution style if possible -- more than that, if at all possible.\nA college student who immigrated from Somalia who later applied and received U.S. citizenship, attempted to blow up a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Oregon.\nAn immigrant from Afghanistan who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship, and a legal permanent resident from the Philippines were convicted for plotting to join Al Qaida and the Taliban in order to kill as many Americans as possible -- as many as possible.\nAn Iraqi immigrant who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was arrested for lying to federal agents about pledging allegiance to ISIS, his travels to Syria, and how many Americans he wanted to kill.\nTwo immigrants from Pakistan who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship were sentenced to decades long prison sentences for plotting to detonate a bomb -- and a very big bomb, in the middle of New York City.\nAn immigrant from Yemen who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was arrested for trying to join ISIS. He was also charged with attempting to illegally buy firearms to try to shoot as many American military personnel as possible.\nAll right folks. So, I just say, what are we doing? What are we doing? And Hillary Clinton wants more and more to pour in. You can almost say, you know, politics aside, whether you are a Democrat, whether you are a liberal, a Republican, a conservative; what are they doing? I don't care who you are, what the hell are they doing? [applause]\nSo we are going to have strong borders, our southern border is going to be very powerful. We are going to stop the drugs from pouring into Wisconsin and every place else. [applause]\nThe heroin epidemic is beyond belief. In New Hampshire, a great place, that is where I realized the extent of what is going on. I met with the people of New Hampshire and they tell me, \"the biggest problem they have is heroin.\" I said, \"it can't be with the beautiful lakes and streams, it so beautiful.\" Right, and their biggest problems heroin. I said, \"you have to be kidding, that can't be right, \" and it was. Their youth is being poisoned. And then you go to Massachusetts, and you go to North Carolina, and South Carolina, and you come here, you come here -- I just left Iowa, you go to Iowa and you see the tremendous problems they have with heroin and drugs that pour in from the southern border. And look, here's the story, we are going to have strong borders. We are going to have a wall, it will be a big and powerful wall -- a big powerful wall. [applause]\nYou know that Hillary Clinton wanted a wall a number of years ago? She wanted a wall. And the primary research, as we understand it, looking back, not that long ago, she wanted a wall. You know, walls do work folks, all you have to do is ask Israel. All you have to do is ask some of the nations that are in Europe right now that are building walls.\nYou know, it's sort of interesting, Obama talks about, \"there will be no wall.\" But in the White House, which he just said, which is true, they want to build essentially a wall, they want to build a fence a lot bigger, and a lot higher, and a lot stronger.\nYou know, it is interesting. I say, \"don't build that fence right, don't build that fence,\" because they say, \"walls don't work\" -- fences don't work, don't build that fence.\"\nWhen Hillary doesn't want to let you have your guns, she is surrounded by people like this that have more firepower on them than any human beings on earth, and I think she doesn't want to have guns. I think that all of her bodyguards and all of her Secret Service should immediately give up their weapons. [applause]\nOK, I mean it. They should immediately give up their weapons. They should immediately give up those weapons and if somebody comes at you with a gun, you just try to talk them out of it, I guess. You got to do some quick talking.\nYou got to do some quick talking, Hillary. I don't think even Hillary with her phony lies and disgusting habits, I don't think Hillary could get away with that one. [applause]\nSo we are going to have a little contrast. And I did this very quickly but it is so simple, Hillary wants to raise taxes, Trump is going to lower taxes very substantially, the biggest tax decrease of all on business and on person.\nHillary wants to significantly expand regulations.[booing] Trump is going to get rid of many, many, many regulations. [applause]\nWhich, by the way, are stopping your businesses both small and big from succeeding, from expanding and more than anything, from starting. You can't start a business today the regulations are so onerous and horrible.\nHillary wants to shut down energy production. [booing] Trump wants to expand it significantly. And we'll start paying off our debt. [applause]\nHillary wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment, take away your right. [booing] Donald Trump will protect it more so than any president that has ever served. [applause]\nCrooked Hillary wants far left activities judges forced over there by Bernie and by Pocahontas. [laughter]\nWho will destroy our Constitution. I want judges who will support and defend our Constitution. [applause]\nAs close, by the way, to Justice Scalia who was great as we could get, OK? [applause]\nHillary wants to open our borders, just open them up because her special interests and donors want it that way. There are reasons, I understand that. I want to totally secure our borders. But I want people to come in. But they come in through a process and they come in legally. [applause]\nHillary wants to invade foreign countries. You ever see the one where she says \"Donald Trump with the nuclear\" -- I'm -- I didn't want the war in Iraq. And I'm on record. I didn't want the war in Iraq. I didn't want all of -- what they've done. And I said, if you read Esquire Magazine from a long time ago, you'll see everything I said was exactly right. It's going to de-stabilize the Middle East.\nI said the meanest, toughest group of people, the people that hate the United States and its people the most, they're going to take it over. That's exactly what's happening. They're taking over the oil, they're taking over the land, they're taking over everything. I didn't want it, but I'm always being accused like the war hog they think I'm a tough guy, the war hog. Right?\nThey think she wants to be tough with Russia. So she said well, Donald Trump likes Putin. I don't know Putin, folks. I don't know. I hope I like him, I hope he likes me because I'd love to get along with Russia. OK? [applause]\nLove to. But I don't know. But she goes Donald Trump, Donald Trump -- think about it -- wants to befriend Putin and other things, she said right? And I'm saying to myself what's wrong with that? That's good.\nBut she's going to be the tough one, see? She's going to be the tough one. She's going to play with nuclear weapons, you know? They have all the nukes, nice nukes. She's going to be the tough one.\nI'll tell you what, you put her in the office of the president -- you know, she hates Putin and Putin hates her, right? That's what I hear. No, no -- Putin probably doesn't respect her more than anything else. But Putin hates her. But she's going to be tough. We're going to be tough with Russia -- oh, we're going to be tough, right? Let me tell you, we're in a different world today, folks. We're in a different world.\nBut she makes it sound like I'm this tough guy that will have a temperament. You know, she uses the word -- you know who gave her the word? Her people that write the speeches, we'll say Trump with a temperament.\nThey said Trump in a speech with tweets. I've got -- I've got between Facebook and Twitter like almost 21, 22 million people. It's an asset, it's an asset. I tweet well. But -- but she said -- she made the statement during her speech, you know, I heard it barely because I was falling asleep, you couldn't watch it. [laughter]\nAll right. So remember that one. Hillary wants to invade foreign countries. Look at Libya. Look at that. We did a great job there. You know, a spot hit on Gaddafi maybe, but I mean even that, what the hell do we get out of this? It's a disaster. Then you have Benghazi, then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS taking over the oil, large portions of the oil. And it's some of the finest oil in the world. And you have ISIS grabbing it.\nWe don't know what we're doing. We have people that don't know what we're doing. We have people that militarily -- in fact, they said well, who is your military consultants? And I give them names. But they're not working now, you know they're not working now. And I said of course they're not working now, look what working now people have gotten us. Havoc, who the hell wants the people who are working now? I mean... [applause]\nYou know, a lot of it's common sense and a lot of it's instinct and she has very bad judgment, she's got no instinct whatsoever. And when I was asked on one of the big networks about NATO, they said what do you think of NATO? Now, you know it's not like it was my primary subject in all fairness. I've only been doing this for 12 months. Now, it's actually almost 14 months, hard to believe, right?\nBut NATO -- so I said I know enough. And sometimes knowing a little is better than knowing too much. You understand, you can't see the forest through the trees, right? So I said NATO in my opinion is obsolete because it's not covering terrorism. Obsolete for that reason and also you have many countries that aren't paying their fair share, they're not paying what they're supposed to be paying. [applause]\nAnd we're protecting those guys and we're supposed to get into World War III for all these countries that aren't paying their fair share. And even the commander of NATO -- and I so respect what he did. He came out the other day and he said Donald Trump is right, we have cut you see that's right did you see the letter -- the big story? Donald Trump is right. I'm sure Obama was thrilled when he saw that. [laughter]\nDonald Trump is right; you have countries that aren't paying. And he said how he goes in and he talks to them. He says look, you've got to pay your bills. I have budgets -- which is true. And I have to go back to Congress and I have to say what's happening.\nThey don't pay their bills though because people don't ask properly. And they probably say to the president or whoever may handle the country. \"Sir, we owe the United States millions of dollars. We're ready to pay.\" Oh, have they asked for the money? No. They'll pay, OK\nBut I will say the commander of NATO said I was right. And then you have these people back here -- stupid people -- right here. They said Donald Trump -- now they're the worst. They're the worst. They said Donald Trump -- Donald Trump doesn't like NATO. He is going to abandon NATO. That's not what I said. I said they've got to pay. They've got to pay.\nNow, you have to walk. You may have to walk. But they've got to pay. We're going to get in World War III for all these countries that are laughing at the stupidity of the United States, right? No, they've got to pay. And they probably will, in all fairness.\nBut Hillary said about Japan -- because Japan, we're defending Japan you know that, right? Now, in all fairness before I came alone put yourself back three years ago. Did anybody know that we defend Japan? Raise your hand who knew. All right, there's about 12 percent.\nNot bad. I think some of you are lying, OK? I think some of you are related to Hillary Rodham Clinton. I think some of you are lying. But we defend Japan and a man comes up, general or something, a few months ago, I remember so vividly. And he said at a news conference because they were embarrassed because I kept saying they've got to pay their way. And if they don't -- if they don't, you always have to be prepared to walk you have to do that.\nYou know, we don't want to do that, I understand the reason. It'd be nice to have them but you know this isn't again 40 years ago. We owe $20 trillion. We're defending all these -- we defend Japan. We defend Germany. We defend Saudi Arabia. You think they have the money to pay -- how about we have military bases that we rent -- we pay rent to Saudi Arabia to protect them? No. No, think of it. Think of it, think of the stupidity. Think of the stupidity. So this general comes up, has a news conference a few months ago. And he said, \"Mr. Trump doesn't understand that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend them.\"\nSo a reporter goes up who I think is there and said to me, \"Mr. Trump, we'd like your comment. They say that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend.\" And I said why aren't they paying 100 percent? The reporter said, OK.\" Not a bad question. Now, here's the problem with the Hillary -- Hillary rotten Clinton. Here's the problem. [applause]\nHere is -- that's why she changed her last -- that's why she doesn't want to use the name anymore, because everybody was saying that. I don't know. I've been saying it.\nBut look, here is -- here is why it doesn't work for Hillary. She saw that I said that we have to get reimbursed for our costs, at least, right?\nJapan, economic behemoth. Germany -- see how well they're doing -- economic behemoth. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.\nThey were making $1 billion a day with their high oil prices, now they're making a fortune, the same thing. Economic behemoth. Why are defending them, and why aren't we being fully reimbursed? Now, if we do that, your budget already is starting to look real good, OK. You know, you have budgets, so we losing our assurance; we have an $800 billion trade deficit, folks.\nWe trade with companies. We have a deficit with other countries, think of it -- $800 billion a year. Trade deficit. Do we make the deals? no.\nWith China, $505 billion trade deficit. And they cheat us because they devalue their currency all the time. Whenever it gets a little bit tough, devalue, devalue, and our companies can't compete with that. Right?\nSo, here's the thing. So, Hillary says about Japan, how dare he not not stay with our allies, how dare he not do that?\nI will never abandon our allies, ever, ever, ever. Now, how do you negotiate when you're telling somebody will never going to leave? We may have to leave.\nLook, Japan has problems because you have the maniac in North Korea making missiles. But I mean, you know, so we'll get it.\nNow, South Korea, it is an economic behemoth. You can't buy television that is not made in South Korea, except Sony, which is made in Japan, which has sort of lost its way. Whether it is LG or Samsung. I order thousands of television sets; you can't buy them in the United States. I'd love to. Show me one company. One of the pundits said, they do make them. There's a company.\nAnd he showed me, it's a little company. What they do is, all the parts come in for -- from all over the world; they put them together, and they give you a television that doesn't work and nobody ever heard of it. [applause]\nAnd then I put it into a luxury hotel, and everybody complains, right?\nSo, you can't say to people when you're negotiating -- because we're talking about tremendous billions and billions of dollars. You can't say to people -- you can't say to people when you're negotiating, we'll never leave you.\nThink of this, we're going to never leave you; we love you, we'll never leave you. Could you pay more? No, we're not going to pay anymore. You're not going to leave us. Why should we pay more?\nSo, there's a chance we'll have to leave. And there's a chance that, you know, Japan will have to take over this monster and figure it out. We're very far away. It's very expensive.\nYou know, we have a treaty with Japan. And if the United States is attacked, they don't have to do anything. But if Japan is attacked, we have to go in there will our full force and might, and who the hell knows what's going to happen, right\nWorld War III, who knows what's going to happen. But if we're attacked, they don't have to do anything. You tell me, who makes these deals?\nIt's like Sergeant Bergdahl, right? So, we trade a dirty, rotten traitor where five or maybe even six people were killed when he deserted, and we knew that they were killed and we knew that he was a traitor. We trade for five of the greatest killers, the greatest killers in the Middle East, the five people that they wanted the most. That is our deal.\nSo, we get a traitor and they get five people that are right now, most of them, already back on the battlefields trying to kill everybody, including us.\nNo more, folks. That is called the five for one president. That's -- that is the same guy that made the deal for $400 million. The other guys couldn't leave the airport, the hostages. And then all of a sudden, they were able to leave.\nAnd then you watched him yesterday saying that, can you believe it? This had nothing to do with that. OK? Just a coincidence. No, no, just a coincidence -- no. You know, she is unfit to serve as president for a lot of reasons. He is unfit also. He has done so bad. He has been so incompetent. We have doubled our debt during his -- think of it. Over the years of our country -- over the years of our country, he gets in, and in eight years by the time his term is up, we will have doubled our national debt.\nThink of it. So, we have to win this election. This is a very important election. I do not need to do this, folks, believe me. I could be elsewhere right now, I love being with you.\nBut I could be elsewhere. I could be -- I might be in Wisconsin, just a different location. OK? But I felt I had to do it. I want to give back. I will get back give back, I'm going to give back. I'm going to give back. [applause]\nI want to give back. Because our country does not win anymore.\nOur country does not win anymore. And it is not going to win with crooked Hillary Clinton. Not going to win. It's not going to win. She does not know how to win. Our country is not going to win with her.\nWe're going to be worse than we are with Obama. I mean, if you want four more years of what is going on, ISIS, all over the place, ISIS expanding.\nAnd by the way, our policeman are great, great people. [applause]\nAnd we are not going to allow our policeman to be shot down anymore. Anymore. No more. No more.\nSo, November 8th, you have a big election. I promise you this, if I win, we're going to start winning again. We are going to win on trade, we're going to win with our military, we're going to take out ISIS, we are going to win for our veterans who have been totally mistreated.\nOur veterans are great. We have a great plan for the veterans. We're are going to win for our veterans, first time, maybe ever.\nWe are going to win on trade deals. We are going to make the finest, we are going to bring our jobs back. We're not going to make it easy for these companies to leave and fire everybody. It going to be very, very expensive when they do it.\nBelieve me, it's going to be very, very expensive. They're going to say, you know what? Maybe we'll stay Wisconsin, OK? Maybe we will stay. [applause]\nNo, it's going to be very, very hard. We're going to have strong borders, we're going to have the wall. Mexico is going to pay for the wall 100 percent, 100 percent. [applause]\nWe are going to get rid of Obamacare. We're going to get rid of Common Core, we're going to bring our education -- local. We're going to have local education.\nWe're going to appoint great Supreme Court justices. [applause]\nAnd folks, we're going to start winning again. We're going to win at every level. We're going to win so much, you're going to get tired of winning, I'm telling you.\nYou're going to be begging me, Mr. President -- you will send your great quarterback, right? He will come to the White House. Everybody respects him. He'll come to the White House, and he'll say, Mr. President, the people of Wisconsin, they can't stand winning so much. [applause]\nCould you tone it down just a little bit? I will say, I just can't do that. We are going to win more, and more and more, we're going to win at every level.\nBut we are going to win. We are going to make America great again. We're going to make America safe again.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-08-05", "title": "Remarks at the KI Convention Center in Green Bay, Wisconsin"}

For more than 50 years, underserved communities and vulnerable populations have relied on the primary and preventive care options these centers provide. During National Health Center Week, we reflect on the important role that health centers have played in delivering the comprehensive care all people deserve.\nWith a strong focus on community-based and patient-centered care, health centers offer more than just treatment for illnesses and injuries; through an emphasis on education and prevention, they promote wellness and help people lead healthier lives. Anyone seeking care can locate their nearest community health center by using the \"Find a Health Center\" tool at www.HRSA.gov. Health centers have also played an important part in implementing the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In addition to giving 20 million more Americans the peace of mind of having quality, affordable health insurance, the ACA has enabled health centers to add more than 950 new service delivery sites across our country. Today, nearly 1,400 health centers operate approximately 9,800 service delivery sites and provide care for nearly 23 million patients.\nHealth centers are an important part of our Nation's health care system, and my Administration remains committed to supporting these facilities and the care they deliver. This year, we invested $94 million to help health centers treat people suffering from substance use disorders—including prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. We have also made new investments to build and renovate health center facilities across our country to help serve more patients and increase availability of oral health services. And because America's health centers are uniquely positioned to address certain public health challenges, we have increased funding to expand critical services in communities that need them most. We have made key investments to help health centers respond to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and combat the growing threat from the Zika virus in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.\nThis week, let us thank the dedicated professionals in our community health centers who provide quality care at affordable prices. Let us build on their efforts to improve the well-being of our people and together continue working to bring about a stronger, healthier Nation for all.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of August 7 through August 13, 2016, as National Health Center Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate this week by visiting their local health center, meeting health center providers, and exploring the programs they offer to help keep families healthy.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Make no mistake, new voter restriction laws in seventeen states have replaced poll taxes and literacy tests as a thinly veiled attempt to achieve an old objective: disenfranchising African Americans, Latinos, low-income people, young people, and people with disabilities.\n\"But we are fighting back. Last week, a court struck down North Carolina's voter ID requirement, saying it was designed to 'target African Americans with almost surgical precision.' Similar restrictions have recently been overturned in Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan, North Dakota, and Kansas after courts found they were intended to discriminate as well.\n\"This November, the notion that every American has a voice in shaping our future is at stake. Donald Trump supports discriminatory voting restrictions – and actually claims that without them in place, the results of American elections should be questioned. It's a dangerous attempt to undermine the legitimacy of our democracy.\n\"I have a very different view. I believe America is stronger when we expand access to the ballot box, not restrict it. That's why I'll fight to repair the Voting Rights Act, expand early voting, and introduce universal, automatic voter registration.  ?\n\"Upon signing the Voting Rights Act in 1965, President Johnson said the right to vote 'is one which no American, true to our principles, can deny.'\n\"He was right.\"", "timestamp": "2016-08-06", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on the 51st Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act"}

People pack arenas and wave flags. Journalists judge every move and overanalyze every misstep. Sometimes we're let down, but more often we're lifted up. And just when we think we've seen it all, we see something happen in a race that we've never seen before.\nI'm talking, of course, about the Summer Olympics. This month, Rio is hosting the first-ever Games held in South America, and we're ready to root on Team U.S.A. We're excited to see who will inspire us this time, whose speed will remind us of Jesse Owens, whose feats will remind us of Bob Beamon's amazing jump? Which young American will leave us awestruck, the way a teenager named Kerri Strug did when she stuck that landing, and when another kid named Cassius Clay gave the world its first glimpse of greatness? Who will match Mary Lou Retton's perfection or pull off an upset like Rulon Gardner's or dominate like the Dream Team?\nThat's why we watch. And we have a lot to look forward to this year. Team U.S.A. reminds the world why America always sets the gold standard: We're a nation of immigrants that finds strength in our diversity and unity in our national pride.\nOur athletes hail from 46 States, DC, and the Virgin Islands. Our team boasts the most women who have ever competed for any nation at any Olympic Games. It includes Active Duty members of our military and our veterans. We've got basketball players who stand nearly 7 feet tall and a gymnast who's 4-foot-8. And Team U.S.A. spans generations: a few athletes who are almost as old as I am and one born just a year before my younger daughter.\nOur roster includes a gymnast from Texas who's so trailblazing, they named a flip after her, a young woman who persevered through a tough childhood in Flint, Michigan, to become the first American woman to win gold in the boxing ring, and a fencing champion from suburban Jersey who'll become the first American Olympian to wear a hijab while competing. And on our Paralympic team, we're honored to be represented by a Navy veteran who lost his sight while serving in Afghanistan and continues to show us what courage looks like every time he jumps in the pool.\nWhen you watch these Games, remember that it's about so much more than the moments going by in a flash. Think about the countless hours these athletes put in, knowing it could mean the difference in a split-second victory that earns them a lifetime of pride and gives us enduring memories. It's about the character it takes to train your heart out, even when no one's watching. Just hard work, focus, and a dream. That's the Olympic spirit, and it's the American spirit too.\nIn our Olympians, we recognize that no one accomplishes greatness alone. Even solo athletes have a coach beside them and a country behind them. In a season of intense politics, let's cherish this opportunity to come together around one flag. In a time of challenge around the world, let's appreciate the peaceful competition and sportsmanship we'll see, the hugs and high-fives, and the empathy and understanding between rivals who know we share a common humanity. Let's honor the courage it takes, not only to cross the finish line first, but merely to stand in the starting blocks. And let's see in ourselves the example they set: proving that no matter where you're from, with determination and discipline, there's nothing you can't achieve.\nThat idea, that you can succeed no matter where you're from, is especially true this year. We'll cheer on athletes on the first-ever Olympic Refugee Team: ten competitors from the Congo, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Syria who personify endurance.\nTo all of our Olympic and Paralympic athletes wearing the red, white, and blue, know that your country couldn't be prouder of you. We admire all the work you've done to get to Rio and everything you'll do there. Thank you for showing the world the best of America. And know that when you get up on that podium, we'll be singing the national anthem—and maybe even shedding a tear—right alongside you.\nNow go bring home the gold!", "timestamp": "2016-08-06", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "Remarks as prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119744", "text": "Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It's wonderful to be in Detroit.\nWe now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America. It's a conversation about how to Make American Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least.\nThe City of Detroit Is Where Our Story Begins\nDetroit was once the economic envy of the world. The people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.\nWhen we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming. Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream.\nBut for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.\nWhen we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own. The skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit. Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.\nToday, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000 dollars, about half of the national average. 40 percent of the city's residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average. The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. Half of all Detroit residents do not work.\nDetroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime—these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.\nIn short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda. Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.\nShe supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community…and the crime policies that have made you less safe…and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets...and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries… and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity.\nShe is the candidate of the past.\nOurs is the campaign of the future.\nThis is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results.\nToday, I will outline my economic vision. In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.\nOur opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas. All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production.\nIf you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.\nNothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.\nThe one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States. Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.\nThat's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.\nMy campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first.\nHere is what an America First economic plan looks like.\nFirst, let's talk tax reform.\nTaxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.\nHillary Clinton—who has spent her career voting for tax increases—plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase. Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.\nRecently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again—to use a now famous term—when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.\nI am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.\nThe rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.\nAs part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.\nTax simplification will be a major feature of the plan.\nOur current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance.\nMy plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process. We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent. For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.\nWhile we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity.\nThese reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.\nWe will Make America Grow Again.\nIn the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family. It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.\nThe State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton's failed leadership. The Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton's broken promises. She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator. But what happened? The Washington Post writes, and I quote: \"upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent…the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation… Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run…data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton's first term.\"\nCompare that to my record. In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, \"How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,\" the paper writes that I—and this is a direct quote—\"waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out…almost by force of will — [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.\"\nThis is what I want to do for our country—I want to jumpstart America.\nNow let's look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally.\nTheir policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt.\nThere are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force. It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people.\nThe Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans.\nHome ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.\nNearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office. Another nearly 7 million Americans were added to the ranks of those in poverty.\nWe have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.\n58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.\n1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. These are the real unemployment numbers—the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.\nMeanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago.\nThe average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes. On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent.\nThe United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent. It's almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level.\nIn other words, we punish companies for making products in America—but let them ship products into the U.S. tax-free if they move overseas.\nThis is backwards. All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.\nUnder my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business. I am going to cut regulations massively.\nOur lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country—and into cities like Detroit. To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments.\nNo one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans.\nMy plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes.\nWe are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas. Our plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax. This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan.\nFinally, no family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death—it's just plain wrong. We will repeal it.\nNext comes regulatory reform\nAs with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want to keep jobs and wealth in America.\nMotor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980.\nIt is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year—that's money taken straight out of cities like yours.\nThe federal register is now over 80,000 pages long. As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more.\nIn 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations—each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy.\nIt is time to remove the anchor dragging us down.\nUpon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations. My running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses.\nI will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.\nNext, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs. Those regulations will be eliminated.\nWe are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win. When I am president, we will.\nOne of the most important reforms of all is trade reform\nAs Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. We've seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. We've seen it in Iran. We've seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.\nBut we've also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in Detroit.\nHillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth.\nShe supported Bill Clinton's NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nLet's talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers.\nPresident Obama, and the usual so-called experts who've been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion—resulting in some 70,000 jobs.\nLike Hillary Clinton's broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Our exports to South Korea haven't increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion—more than doubling our trade deficit with that country.\nThe next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Hillary Clinton's closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. Guaranteed. Her donors will make sure of it.\nA vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP—and it's also a vote for NAFTA.\nOur annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion. Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year.\nThis is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000.\nDetroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton's apology. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.\nHillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal.\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015.\nBy far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs.\nMichigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members.\nJust imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved. That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen. Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.\nBecause my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA. If we don't get a better deal, we will walk away.\nAt the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China. This alone could return millions of jobs into our economy.\nChina is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit. They break the rules in every way imaginable. China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property. They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers.\nJust enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States.\nAdd to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.\nTrade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.\nAlso critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform\nThe Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses.\nAs a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs. Hillary Clinton says her plan will \"put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.\"\nWe will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.\nClinton not only embraces President Obama's job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans.\nAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.\nA Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.\nAccording to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will:\nIncrease GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years;\nIncrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades;\nIncrease totaleconomic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years.\nThe reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning\nWhen we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity.\nWe can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\nAs part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families. I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts.\nLikewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice.\nWe will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country. Without security, there can be no prosperity. We must have law and order.\nIn the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items. One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.\nWe will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide—saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country.\nWe also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration. This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.\nDetroit—the Motor City—will come roaring back. We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past.\nOur party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.\nThe other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday—who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.\nThere will be no change under Hillary Clinton—only four more years of Obama.\nBut we are going to look boldly into the future.\nWe will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves.\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas.\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.\nWe will put new American metal into the spine of this nation.\nIt will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy—mined from American sources—that powers this country.\nIt will be American workers who are hired to do the job.\nAmericanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.\nOur country will reach amazing new heights.\nAll we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past.\nWe can't fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.\nWe can't solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them.\nOnly by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results.\nWe need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.\nBefore everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn't be done.\nAmerica is ready to prove the doubters wrong.\nThey want you to think small. I am asking you to think big.\nWe are ready to dream great things for our country once again.\nWe are ready to show the world that America is Back—Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before.\nThank you, and God Bless You.", "timestamp": "2016-08-08", "title": "Remarks to the Detroit Economic Club"}

This is unbelievable.\" Nobody believes it.\nThe crowds we're getting -- I'm the messenger, but I'll tell you what, the message is the right message. We're tired of incompetence. We're tired of not taking care of our military. We're tired of not taking care of our vets, who are being taken care of very poorly.\nWe're tired of so many different things. And this is what happens. So, our mayor, my friend, Rudy Giuliani just walks, I'm telling you, he said, \"I don't believe this. This is incredible.\"\nAnd what he hasn't seen, and your governor, by the way, who's a great guy.\nAnd he's now seeing it, they're walking outside because there are thousands of people outside that can't get in. I said, \"Rudy, you think this is bad, go take a look outside.\"\nSo I just want to thank Pat and Rudy and I want to thank everybody for being here. And we are going to have a good time. We love North Carolina. We love North Carolina [applause]\nWe did really well in the primaries if you remember, and I hear we are doing really well now. We have to win. That November 8 day is so important.\nYou know, I bring things up like the judges right? Supreme Court Justices, we have to get - you know, you could have as many as four? I guess it's a scenario where this president could pick five Supreme Court Justices.\nAnd if you pick two that are left, left, left, it's going to be a disaster for our country. Your Second Amendment, the National Rifle Association endorsed and they endorsed me early, a long time ago. And they're great people, Wayne and Chris, they are great people. [applause]\nBut if you - if you do something with these - I'll tell you what, Justices right now, you lost a great one with Scalia. We want to replace with Justices very much like Justice Scalia and that's going to happen. It is so important.\nSo if for no other reason, I mean it's such an important - it's one of the most important elections for a lot of reasons, not just that but for a lot of reasons. But that's so obviously, because for whatever reason, they say this could be the presidency. This next four years is where you will pick more Supreme Court Justices than anybody has every had the opportunity to do. Believe me, I'll make you very proud of those Justices everyday. [applause]\nSo we had an incident a few days ago with the $400 million - all cash, right -- $400 million in all cash, anybody know what that looks like? That's a lot of cash. That's a lot of case.\nAnd honestly, it's so sad. Think of it, going to Iran, a terrorist state. Now I happen to think they have plenty of money, we've given then $150 billion, so the $400 million is just, you know - I happen to think it goes into their accounts in Switzerland personally.\nNow, a lot of people say, \"no, no, it's used for terror,\" and they use it for terror because it's the number one terror funder - not even close. But I also think that when you have $400 million in cash, different denominations, do you see the size of this? I guess they did release the pictures after all. They released pictures.\nAnd interesting I'll tell you, I sort of think it goes into bank accounts, right? You know, I sort of think they take it, they probably use some for this, some for that. You can do a lot of things.\nAnd Obama said that he did it because we don't have a working account with Iran. Do you believe that? How long does it take to set up an account? Right? You don't have a working account, you set up an account, right?\nYou set up an account and it takes about - look, what's going on in this country - folks, folks, what's going on in this country is insane. And we have people running our country that don't know what they're doing, they're grossly incompetent, and it's time. We have to make change, real change. Not Obama change, we have to make change.\nWhether it's Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl who was a traitor, and they get five of the greatest killers that they've wanted for eight years. We get Bergdahl -- I call it the five for one trade. For the Iran deal, where we get nothing, we get nothing.\nThey get ultimately, they have the path, beautiful path, they'll get way, way earlier than that. They'll get nuclear weapons, so if you get Trump you're going to see a lot of changes to that deal. That'll happen fast. [applause]\nYou're going to see some big changes and what I really -- I mean, I saw where President Obama said that the $400 million in cash was not, had nothing to do with the release of the hostages, right? It really doesn't work, does it? Does it? I mean, remember Obamacare, \"you're going to keep your doctor, you're going to keep your plan, over and over again, you're going to keep your doctor.\" It was a lie.\nAnd in fact, if he didn't make the lie, he would have never gotten it approved because most Democrats, many of the Democrats didn't want to do it. It was only that, that got them to sign it and to approve it. And it was a lie.\nAnd the $400 million, and from what the rumor is and from what the reports are, the hostages couldn't leave the airport until this other plane arrived. They don't know why, but I think we all have a pretty good reason why. It was all a big lie, it was all a big lie.\nAnd it's so sad to see, and let me tell you, Hillary Clinton is going to be four more years of Obama, but maybe worse. Maybe worse. There'll be four more years. Four more years of ISIS, four more years of high taxes. You know yesterday I had a -- at a big event, really. It turned out to be a very big event in Detroit [applause]\nGood event, very good. And we got wonderful reviews and a lot of good comments. But the thing I'm doing, I'm cutting taxes big league. Especially for the middle class and especially for businesses. Because businesses are dying and that means small businesses, businesses period. [applause]\nBusinesses are leaving our country like they've never left before. They're going all over. They're going to Mexico, that I can tell you. Mexico is like the eighth wonder of the world. You know I've been telling a story, a friend of mine, good friend of mine, good guy. He builds plants, he builds plants for cars, for computers, you know where they make them. Massive plants. And I said to him, how are you doing?\nAnd he's worked in North Carolina, by the way. I said to him, how are you doing? He said phenomenal. He's like, \"I think the biggest in the world at this -\" that's what he does. Great guy. I said how's it all going? He said, 'you've got to see Mexico, Donald. It's the eighth wonder of the world. What we're building there is like, never has been built. We've never seen anything like it\".\nAnd I said, how are we doing in the United States? I'm more interested in that, OK? It's OK I guess. Right? You know, America first, folks. America first. America. [applause]\nRight, America first. [applause]\nAmerica first. We get a little tired of these deals where they actually put, and you know why, because of lobbyists and special interests and people representing and people wanting it to happen. It's just not that they want other countries to benefit over us. There are reasons for it and you know, when I raise money, and I'm putting up a lot of money for my own campaign, I'm funding me.\nAnd I'm raising for the Republican party. And we're getting a lot of money from the small donors.\nRemember two months ago? Well, I hadn't started; I wanted to make sure I get the nomination before I start, right?\nLet me get the nomination, please. And then I took a lot of heat from the press, the world's most dishonest people, by the way. [applause] Terrible. [applause] Terrible. [applause]\nThose cameras will not move and show how many people are in this auditorium. Those cameras -- those cameras are not going on the move unless we have a protester, is there a protester up there in the quota? Any protesters? [laughter]\nIf we had a protester that's the only time they move because they're showing something that in their mind is a bad thing, so then they move. But I like that, I've always liked my protesters because the cameras show these massive crowds and people say wow, was that a big crowd.\nYou know, I go home to my wife, I say how's it going? She says darling, your speech was very good, were there many people there? I say yeah, about 7,000. That's a small group.\nIts only confined -- I mean you had to see outside. I felt so badly -- I came up -- I came up -- thank you and I love you too. Who said that? Who said that, huh? [applause]\nThank you, thank you. But I came up with Rudy from New York and we're driving up and we're going block after block after block the line. And I said are those people going to be able to get in?\nThey said the place is already full. And Rudy just said man; I've never seen anything like that. Maybe a couple of days before an election, but this is what's happening. Because of the fact we have a movement going, folks.\nBecause people are so tired of them. [applause]\nThey're so tired of them. [applause]\nSo -- and by the way -- and by the way, voter ID, watch with that. Watch with voter ID, why aren't we having voter ID? In other words, I wanna vote, here's my identification, I wanna vote, as opposed to somebody coming up and voting 15 times for Hillary. [booing]\nWell -- and I will not tell you to vote 15 times. I will not tell you to do that, OK? [applause]\nYou won't vote 15 times. But people will, they'll vote many times and how that could've happened , it's unbelievable. And the governor just told me that they're going before the United States Supreme Court Justice Roberts and maybe they can get a stay. Let's see what happens, OK? [applause]\nLet's see what happens. That's a very important thing. But I wrote a few things down and to me, so important -- yes, darling thank you. [laughter]\nUnstable Hillary lacks the judgment, now; Bernie Sanders said she lacks judgment, right? And nobody said anything about it, no problem. He said you lack judgment. And -- during one of the debates, nobody said, it was fine.\nWhen I say it they say that's terrible the way you talk. [laughter]\nShe does, she lacks judgment, she lacks temperament and I'm the one that used unfit many, many months ago. And now they've turned it around, use it on me, unfit? I'm unfit? That's -- that's a first. But she lacks the temperament and the moral character to lead this country, its very simple.\nShe really does. She's a dangerous person who doesn't tell the truth which has been proven very loudly.\nI've never seen a -- I don't think we've ever had greater proof of that, of anybody. [applause]\nAnd she has disregarded the lives of Americans -- you see what's happening -- with what she has done with her server? And you know why she did that.\nSo, I just look at this, and I said that if she gets elected, she will cause the destruction of this country from within. Remember that. Remember that. [applause]\nShe will -- she will allow people into our country that will do damage, they will do damage, folks. You look at what's going on in the world -- look at France; take a good look at France. I have friends that go to France. They used to love France.\nThey say, no thank you. They don't expect to be going back anytime for a long time.\nI have one friend, I said, how was your trip this year to France? He said, France isn't France anymore. We're not going. And so many people are saying that.\nLook at what's going on with Germany. Look at what's happening with Germany. Look at the crime; look at the problems. We have enough problems in our country right now. We don't need additional problems, folks. We don't need additional problems. [applause]\nAnd for all we know, this could be the great Trojan Horse. This could be. We don't know who these people are.\nNow, they're coming in through Obama. And I looked at a chart yesterday, and it's like for years, it's sort of like this, a little uptick. And the last number or period of time, it's like, \"Wah, wah, wah, wah.\" There -- I have never seen anything like it.\nThey're letting them in, and again, you can't vet them. You don't know where they come from. We don't know -- look at the damage that two people in San Bernardino, probably radicalized the guy -- the woman coming in. Look at the damage in Orlando. Look at the damage that was done in Orlando by one wack job, one sick wack job. And you know what he was screaming? He's screaming what they all scream.\nAnd we have to get smart, folks. We don't need the problems -- and we've already got those problems, just so you understand. Because they're coming into the country, they're being put where nobody even knows where they are.\nIt's like, if I were the enemy, I would say, I can't believe they're that stupid. They're taking my people and they're putting them all over the place, because you have great military right here.\nAnd our military...[applause]\nOur military cannot be beaten. But you know what could happen? When we don't know where they are, where they're coming, you've them all over the place.\nAnd folks, it's some. You don't need many; you don't need many. One person in Orlando. Two people -- look at in France, 130. Now, they have the strictest gun laws anywhere in the world, France, Paris. One hundred and thirty people killed, 130.\nAnd I've said 100 times, if this man or if this woman, or if that woman or man had a gun in Paris or in San Bernardino and the bullets were flying in the other direction, would have been a whole different story, folks.\nWould have been a whole different. [applause]\nFor those -- for those foolish people that say Second Amendment, would have been a whole different -- and I'd go a step further. If these people, bad people, bad, sick, sick, sick people.\nIf these people knew there were guns in the good guys hands, right, they probably wouldn't have gone in in the first place, all right? All right? Gun free -- what do you think of these gun- free zones?\nDo you know what a gun-free zone is? That's like -- they study where the gun-free zones -- if they would have known you had guns, if they would have known that they were going to be shot at from the other side, it would have been a whole different story. Maybe it wouldn't have even happened in the first place.\nSo they better not come here. They better not. They better not. [applause]\nSo recently a book came out a couple of weeks ago. A Secret Service agent made a statement because she said the other day she short-circuited. Hey, could you imagine if I said that \"I short circuited\"? [laughter]\nThey would be calling for my execution, -- electric chair. They'd bring back the electric chair. It would be a whole different ball game if I said it, believe me. But the Secret Service agent said, \"She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office,\" right?\n\"From the bottom of my soul,\" he said, \"I know this to be true. Her leadership style, which is volcanic and impulsive, and she makes bad decisions. OK? Hey, you know, it's one thing to make bad decisions. It's another thing to be wacky and make bad decisions. [laughter and applause]\nShe is disdainful of the rules set for everyone else and she hasn't changed a bit. This is -- that was the good thing. I couldn't say the bad things. It was too much. Nobody would even -- nobody would even believe it. You've got to see this book. Nobody would believe because it's so terrible, so terrible.\nAnd she comes across like this woman -- nice, easy -- but she's not. And -- and she's -- listen -- she's not a leader, not a leader. And she is a liar. [applause]\nHey, hey -- 33,000 e-mails are gone. OK? 33,000 e-mails are gone. They're gone. How do you get rid of 33,000 e-mails? Who sends 33,000 e-mails? I mean, 33 -- do you know how many that is? I think that's like 24 hours a day reading them or sending them, but it wouldn't matter. For years, 33,000 e-mails are missing.\nAnd she's so guilty. She's so guilty. [applause]\nI think it's a tremendous blot in our country. I really mean that. I think what happened over the last two weeks with respect to her, especially in light of the fact that General Petraeus and many others have suffered unbelievable consequences. I think it's a tremendous blot on our country, a tremendous blot. Just remember that.\nBut I just looked at this -- the economic failures of Obama and Clinton, et cetera. Obama-Clinton economic policies have produced 1.2 percent economic growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Now, this is, like, unbelievable -- 1.2.\nDo you know China goes to 7 percent or 8 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. Now, what they do is they cut their currency.\nThey devalue their currency, and big league, and then all of our businesses continue to be drained out of the United States. Our money, our jobs. They make our product, they sell our product to us. No tax, no nothing, you devalue -- see devaluing is sort of cheating.\nYou know, it's sort of like cheating. Now I have great relationships with China. I've done great business with China, I've done really well with China. I have these tenants, I sell condos, I own the Bank of America building in San Francisco with a group, a great group, thank you ma'am. [applause]\nGot to win -- got to win North Carolina. Thank you. [applause]\nThank you. But they -- it's cheating, it's really cheating. And when I look at these trade deals -- it's so sad -- where we lose $800 billion -- billion with B -- dollars a year on trade with China alone, it's $400 billion and $500 billion and $505 billion. This is year in and year out, it's actually amazing that our country keeps going. But what has happened is, we have people in the audience, in 18 years, they're making less money now than they made 18 years ago, in real wages, 18.\nAnd in many cases, they're working two and three jobs, OK? But they're making less money now than they made 18 years ago. And those stats come right out, real wages. They're working harder, they're getting older.\nSo in theory it's supposed to be the other way, you know you work and you're young, you don't care. Get a little older, it's like, oh by the way, how about me? I think I'm working harder too, if you want to know. [applause]\nI never worked this hard in my life. But I like it, I like it, I love it actually because I've met so many incredible people. You know I really got -- thank you -- I really got a tremendous understanding of this country. Because I'm going to places that I've heard about, I've known about, I'm stopping everywhere. And I see the carnage that NAFTA has caused, I see the carnage. It's been horrible. I see upstate New York, I see North Carolina, but I see every state. You look at New England. New England got really whacked. New England got hit.\nYou look at Ohio, what happened there, and still happening. By the way, this isn't like it's going to happen or it's all over, it's getting worse. You look at Ohio, you look at Michigan, what's going on with the car plants being built in Mexico, is unbelievable.\nAnd more and more, you know they're moving. We were just talking about the autoworkers yesterday. Where they've lost over 100,000 autoworkers in Michigan, the state of Michigan, which is our car capital and it's really not the car capital anymore. Mexico will become the new car capital of the world in a very short period of time. No, think of it.\nAnd that's only because we allow it to happen. And I like Mexico. And I respect the leaders of Mexico because they're much smarter, they're much street smarter, but they're much smarter and more cunning than our leaders. But you have to see what's going on. And one of the reasons I won Indiana was Bobby Knight, because he's the best, he's the greatest. [applause]\nBut one of the reasons is that Carrier Air Conditioning let 1,400 people go and they're building a plant in Mexico. And we're not going to let it happen . . .\nIt's a suicidal pact for our country. And you know I've watched for years.\nI was never a politician until 14 months ago. So I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician. [applause]\nCan't believe it. [applause]\nBut -- but I've been watching for years and I've watched as -- as the government tries to keep businesses from leaving our country and going to other countries. And I've seen low interest loans, I've seen zero interest loans, I've seen all sorts of subsidies.\nI get it. That stuff's not gonna work, that's not gonna work. What's gonna work is -- as an example, Carrier moves to Mexico and you wish him a lot of luck, good luck, have a nice plant. I hope my friend bills it, right?\nAnd then you know what happens? When they make their air conditioners -- and then think they're gonna sell that air conditioner, people living in Indianapolis -- where they come from -- for a similar price.\nAnd they think they're gonna sell it there and have no repercussions? With me, they have repercussions, OK? [applause]\nWith me, they have repercussions. [applause]\nWith me, we inform them that if you move, you're gonna pay a 35 percent tax on every single air conditioner that pour across our now very secure borders. [applause]\nAnd two things are gonna happen, one of two things -- one of two things are gonna happen. Number one, if you get them in time, they're not moving. Throws it all off-balance, since they're all off-kilter. Number one they're not -- now, nobody -- people would say well, why doesn't anybody use this? Why doesn't anybody mention it?\nI'll tell you why. Because they're controlled by their lobbyists, they're politicians. And Carrier goes out or whoever it might be this -- I'm just using Carrier as an example. Its hundreds and thousands. Its thousands of company.\nAnd millions of jobs we're talking about. I was looking at numbers -- I'm not gonna repeat the numbers because they'll say I was wrong, it can't be that high, I couldn't believe it was that high. But it's thousands of companies and millions and millions of jobs.\nAnd you'd say why aren't -- like, why doesn't somebody else say what Trump is saying? So I'm controlled by myself because I'm putting up my money, OK? I'm putting up my money. [applause]\nBut...[applause]\nAlthough we raised, did you see $82 million last month, $82 million last month? [applause]\nAnd a lot of it -- a lot of the money was the small donations which Republicans never get. A lot of them -- I think it averaged $61 a hit, $61 can you imagine that? The total that we raised and in fact, in May I told you I was taking heat because they said Donald Trump didn't raise any money.\nAnd they told you why, right? I didn't raise it because I didn't know -- I gotta make sure I got the nomination. If I didn't get the nomination, I would've gone to Turnberry and played golf, OK? [laughter]\nIn Scotland. But you know what? I got the nomination so now I had a start. And we raised $51 million in June, right? A lot of it in small donations and we raised $82 million in July.\nPeople are going, even the haters back there, the people that truly hate Trump -- they said, that's amazing. So we're doing all right. And people look, they want -- they wanna hear this message. Because this is a message this is an important message.\nBut when you say -- and when you hear what I just said -- you charge a tariff or a tax. And guess what? And people said why hasn't the -- why haven't the politicians, they're smart, why haven't they done it?\nBecause they're controlled by people that work for many of these companies and they're not gonna do it. Whether it's donors or whether its special interests or lobbyists they control because they want it to happen.\nAnd honestly, I think it's a total disgrace.\nI think it's a total disgrace for the millions of jobs, and for the thousands and thousands of companies that have left our country. If I were here to speak to every one of those companies for five minutes -- bye, bye.\nThey were so quiet. You know, I like the Hillary protesters. You know why? They're so nice and quiet. The Bernie protesters were brutal; they were tough. Right? The Hillary protesters had no spirit. Did you see that?\nShe starts screaming and the guy walks up, \"I'll go.\" [laughter]\nThe Bernie ones were -- they had a lot more spirit. I think we're going to get a lot of Bernie voters, if you want to know the truth. Because they do understand that trade is killing us. Trade. [applause]\nSo, a few things, a few other facts I wrote, which I think are amazing. One is the 1.2 percent lowest in, you know, forget it. That's not a recovery. It's probably much -- don't forget, when they announced 1.2 percent, that means it's lower. And 1.2 is starting to set records.\nThe national debt -- so, we're up to almost $20 trillion -- $20 trillion! The national debt under Obama has doubled. Think of it, doubled. Might be, I think by the time he gets out, it's going to more than double, but again, we have to very accurate\nBecause I'll say -- they'll say, well, it hasn't quite doubled. Believe me, by the time he gets out it will have more than doubled.\nThe national debt has doubled. And you know the bad part about that? You think if the national debt has doubled, our infrastructure would be great, our country would be in great shape\nWe'd have beautiful roads, beautiful highways. You see where like 50 percent of the bridges are in danger in this country. And the roadways are a mess.\nI have a friend, he's in the trucking business. He said, you know, for years, he had no problem. Now he buys these big, beautiful trucks, and the wheels get wiped out because of the potholes on the highways and things that he never had. So, you think with all of that doubling of the national debt, you'd really think that we'd be in good shape from the infrastructure standpoint, right? We're not. We're in very bad shape.\nU.S. trade deficit, $800 -- almost $800 billion. Nearly 24 million Americans in their prime earning years are out of the labor force, right?\nIn the last seven years, another 14 million people have left the work force. Think of it. These are the real numbers, not the 5 percent nonsense.\nYou know, you look for a job, you can't find your job, you go home, you share, you go to your parents, you go to your friends, you do whatever. You gave up, and now you're considered -- statistically, you're considered employed.\nThose people are not employed; these are great people. And there are plenty of them in here.\nI mean, we have great people. We have the most loyal people. We have the smartest people. You know, so many of my people, they're so smart.\nThey like to say, well, Trump, I don't know if he's got this right -- let me tell you, we have the smartest people. We have the people that are the smartest, and the strongest, and the best and the hardest working. [applause]\nWe have the smartest people. We'll put I.Q.s among -- some of us, we couldn't say all of us, right -- against any I.Q.s that we -- we have to deal with, . . .\nIn the last seven years, 14 million. One in five American households do not have a single member in the workforce. Pretty bad.\nHomeownership -- this is one that is amazing to me -- today, homeownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.\nSo you own homes, I mean it always used to be the dream to own a home, right? The American home.\nLowest that its been in so many years, 51 years. Nearly 12 million people and more Americans are dependent on food stamps and 2 million more Latino Americans live in poverty under Obama and Clinton -- under Obama; because Clinton's just gonna carry on.\nYou know, I don't know if you saw. I gave a massive tax decrease yesterday at regulations, we're gonna get rid of so many of them. But Clinton is gonna double your taxes; she's gonna double up your taxes.\nAnd she's trying to say well, I don't know like Trump's way -- she's gonna double up your taxes. You're gonna have massive tax increases is Clinton gets in. Enjoy -- enjoy it folks, if that happens.\nFifty eight percent of African American youth are not employed. How sad is that? American households are earning $4,000 less -- listen to this one, today -- than they were 16 years ago. Many workers are earning less than 1970 in real dollars.\nSo 1970 -- that's a long time ago, right? They're earning in real dollars less money. So under my plan, we're gonna create millions of new and really good paying jobs. You know, it's interesting because even the pro-Obama people say about the jobs that they're bad jobs.\nI've heard it from many of the people. They're trying to defend him. But they say they're bad jobs, they're not good jobs. The good jobs -- the good jobs have left. But we'll create millions of new good paying jobs but good jobs.\nThat's so important, that's so important. [applause]\nEveryone's taxes will go down. Hillary Clinton has supported tax increases on the middle class for her entire career. She's voted for higher taxes, 235 times in the Senate. That's all? I thought it was more than that, 235 times. I hope there's not a decimal point in there or so, 23.5 times.\nBut I don't think there is -- voted for higher taxes, 235 times in the Senate. Now, she's planning another job killing -- $1.3 trillion tax increase, that's what her tax increase is gonna be, folks. Like you're not paying enough, right?\nHer plan will tax many small business -- businesses who are already in deep trouble out of business. Then we have -- we will make -- and this is so important, this was an Ivanka Trump, OK? My daughter, so great. [applause]\nSo great. [applause]\nWe're gonna make childcare expenses tax deductible for working families. [applause]\nAnd just many, many other things. I mean, we're gonna make some unbelievable changes and it's -- it's so easy. Again, you know regulations -- I'm traveling all over and I'm meeting with business owners -- and beyond business owners, even people that work at the businesses, they're being laid off because of it.\nRegulations; if I told you -- and I'm so surprised, this is probably the biggest surprise -- if you have a small business and I said, you can have one or the other, a major tax cut like we're gonna -- you know, we're bringing it down to 15 percent from more than -- much more than double that.\nBut if I told you that you could have a massive tax decrease or really substantially -- but in a real way -- cut regulations -- a hundred percent of the people I talk to would take the regulation, if you could only have one or the other. It's amazing, its amazing\nAnd that surprised me. Surprised you too? [applause]\nSurprised him, too. [applause]\nA hundred percent. I mean, everybody -- businesses can't form anymore, the tax -- the regulatory burden is so incredible that you can't form businesses -- very hard -- and businesses that are in existence are being put out of existence for regulations that don't do anything. We want safety regulations, we want environmental regulations. We're not, you know, people that don't want these things. We have to have that.\nWe want clear air, we want clean water. We want clear water. But -- but...[applause]\nTo do that -- and there are certain things that you want to do, but to do that, you don't have to destroy our country and destroy our businesses. [applause]\nSo you know, I just wrote this down today. Hillary wants to raise taxes. It's a comparison. I want to lower them. Hillary wants to expand regulations, which she does big league. Can you believe that? I will reduce them very, very substantially. Could be as much as 70, 75 percent. [applause]\nHillary wants to shut down energy production. I want to expand it. [applause]\nLower electric -- lower electric bills, folks. Hillary wants to abolish -- essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick... [booing]\nIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know. But -- but I'll tell you what. That will be a horrible day. If -- if Hillary gets to put her judges -- right now, we're tied. You see what's going on.\nyou see what's going on? We tied because Scalia - this was not suppose to happen. Justice Scalia was going to be around for ten more years at least and this is what happens. That was a horrible thing.\nSo now look at it. So Hillary essentially wants to abolish the Second Amendment. Now, speaking to the NRA folks - who are great - when you - when you -- and I'll tell you, they endorsed me. [applause]\nThey endorsed me very early. My son's a member. I'm a member.\nIf you - we can add I think the National Rifle Association, we can add the Second Amendment to the Justices - they almost go - in a certain way, hand in hand. Now the Justices are going to do things that are so important and we have such great Justices, you saw my list of 11 that have been vetted and respected. [applause]\nAnd have gotten great. And they to a little equate - but if you don't do the right thing, either you're not going to have a Second Amendment or you're not going to have much of it left. And you're not going to be able to protect yourself, which you need\nYou know, when the bad guys burst into your house, they're not looking about into Second Amendments, and, do I have the right to do this? OK, the bad guys aren't going to be giving up their weapons\nBut the good people will say, \"oh, well, that's the law.\" No, no, not going to happen, we can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. [applause]\nHillary Clinton wants to have totally open borders where people flow into our country. [booing]\nWhere they flow into our country, and they take your jobs, and they do lots of things. And I want people to come into our country but they have to do it through a process, they have to do it legally, right? [applause]\nSo you have drugs pouring in. You have everything coming in.\nYou know, in New Hampshire, a great state, they have a tremendous heroin problem. I said to them, we will stop the drugs from pouring in to our country from the Southern border. They're going to stop. [applause]\nAnd by the way, we will build a wall. That's legal. [applause]\nWalls do work. Walls do work. [applause]\nNow here's one and you know -- I mean she doesn't look that way, but she is -- Hillary wants to invade foreign countries. That's what she does and look at the mess. So we've spent -- you know for two years, for three years, I've been saying we spent $2 trillion, right, in Iraq, more now, I guess. Somebody actually said to me the other day that they were talking about four or five trillion in the Middle East.\nAnd I'm going to get the accurate number. They don't know the accurate number, the truth is they have no idea. They have no idea what we're doing. We're sending equipment over, the enemies take it in. We sent over 2,300 Humvees that are totally armor plated. They got stolen by the enemy, 2,300. I thought they meant like two or 23.\nOr 230 was too much, 2,300 Humvees and they got stolen. They got taken by the enemy. You know, shot guns fired in the air, the ones we gave to the so-called allies, these great allies that we always pick, who end up being worse than the guys who we're trying to get out. [applause]\nSo, terrible. Hillary and President Obama refused to use the term radical Islamic terrorism. Big problem. Big problem. Hillary wants to release violent criminals and criminal offenders from prison, that's wonderful, enjoy yourselves. I want to work with our police. Our police are so incredible, they're not getting the respect they deserve. [applause]\nNot getting the respect they deserve. [applause]\nAnd we're going to, in our country, restore law and order. We have to, we have to restore law and order. [applause]\nAnd the police are going to be careful and they're going to be studied and they're going to be -- but we have to restore law and order. What happened in Dallas, where all of those people were shot down. Absolutely, absolutely for no reason. Viciously shot down, and so many others. I was with one of the police groups the other day. They're endorsing me.\nOf like, eight other states in the last short while where the same, smaller number, but the same thing was happening where police are being killed. We have to respect and cherish our police. [applause]\nSchool choice we want, common core we don't want. We've got to get rid of common core, bring educational...[applause]\nAnd folks, and we have to re-negotiate with NAFTA. And by the way, going back to the wall, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. That I can tell you. [applause]\nListen, you know these politicians, they don't know me. They don't understand me. And I am, I'm in a group of 50 people, these are real geniuses. These are 50 people that have been running our country forever and they said we can't support Donald Trump. The reason they can't, you know why, because I'm not going to hire these people, I don't want these people.\nTake a look. Take a look at what these people -- these are sort of like the people that have been involved with Washington, making decisions militarily on defense, on other things -- take a look what has happened in our country. Our military is depleted, our vets aren't taken care of.\nWe can't beat ISIS. Can you imagine General George Patton, who is right now spinning in his grave, the great General Douglas MacArthur -- can you imagine -- and I say, because we have so many military people, and this is such a military state and I love it. [applause]\nI love. But can you imagine them seeing that we can't beat these 25 or 30,000 people, we can't beat them? We're fighting a political correct war.\nIt's a political correct war. I mean, you know what's going on. You know what's going on. These are people that chop off heads. These are people that, in steel cages, drop steel cages into the waters and drowned large numbers of people.\nThese are people that buried people in the sand. We've got to knock them out.\nI was against the war in Iraq. We shouldn't have been to the war in Iraq. It destabilized the Middle East and I said that was going to happen. But we shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out.\nThe way we got out was insane. And Obama gave a date, and he -- and that's how ISIS happened, folks. Hence, the birth of ISIS. [applause]\nCongratulations, Hillary Clinton. Congratulate -- I mean, she -- she should get -- if I'm ISIS, I call her up and I give her the most valuable player award. OK? [applause]\nAnd I guarantee you with Libya, which was her baby, and all of the other mistakes she has made. Obama takes now, because obviously, for him, that's the better alternative, all right? But he has been an incompetent president. He has done a horrible job. [applause] And I guarantee you that if he had it to it again -- and he would only say this to his wife -- but if he had it to do again, he would not have chosen Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state, because she made so many horrible mistakes and cost so many lives.\nAnd I mean lives on both sides. I'm not just saying -- I mean lives on both sides. She's inept; she's inept.\nAnd to think that she is even allowed to run for the presidency of the United States, when she deleted and got rid of 33,000 e-mails is an embarrassment to our country, and it always will be, OK? It always will be. [applause]\nSo -- so, I want to thank all of you for being here. Look, I'm going to be around, and we're going to be coming to North Carolina a lot. Got to win it, very important [applause]\nBut -- the people are great. My daughter-in-law comes from North Carolina. I'm here all the time. [applause]\nBut -- but people -- the people are great. The military is great. We are going to make America great again. [applause]\nWe're going to start winning. We're going to put America first. We're going to make America safe again.\nBut never, ever forget, we are going to make America great again.\nThank you. Thank you, everybody. I'll be back soon. Thank you. God bless you.", "timestamp": "2016-08-09", "title": "Remarks at a Rally at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122574", "text": "President Obama has led a transformational era of change through technology and innovation that is producing a smarter, savvier, and more effective government for the American people. On August 11, 2014, the President directed his Administration to accelerate efforts to improve and simplify the digital experience between individuals, businesses, and the government through the creation of the U.S. Digital Service.\nOver the last two years, these actions have significantly improved the Federal Government's ability to provide better citizen-centered services and helped Americans engage with their government in new and meaningful ways. From modernizing our country's immigration system to helping students and families make more informed decisions about college selection to developing a unified digital experience for our Veterans, this work has reimagined how government services should be provided to the public. In addition to building these important services, the Administration has created a pipeline for top technology talent from the private sector to participate in tours of duty with the Federal Government and partner with top civil servants to ensure a lasting culture of innovation that will serve the American people for years to come.\n\"In this democracy, we the people recognize that this government belongs to us, and it's up to each of us and every one of us to make it work better... We all have a stake in government success—because the government is us.\"\n— President Obama\nTo mark the second anniversary of the U.S. Digital Service's founding, today the Administration is releasing a list of examples of the progress the U.S. Digital Service and its partners across government are making in building a more effective, citizen-centered government through technology.\nTRANSFORMING CRITICAL SERVICES\nØ      Making it easier for Veterans to access health care. The Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Digital Service introduced a new digital application for health care built with Veterans, not for them. Previously, less than 10 percent of applicants used the Veteran Online Application for a simple reason: the form would not open for most users. The application was a fillable PDF that required Veterans to use Adobe 8 or 9 via Internet Explorer. More than 70 percent of U.S. Government traffic comes from Chrome, Safari, or Firefox, meaning that more than 70 percent of visitors would have trouble accessing the healthcare application. In the 30 days following the launch of the digital application, more than 11,600 Veterans have used it to apply for health care, with many receiving coverage in less than 10 minutes.\nØ      Helping students, parents, and families make more informed decisions about college selection through the College Scorecard. The Department of Education, 18F, and U.S. Digital Service launched the new College Scorecard tool to give students, parents, and their advisors the clearest, most accessible, and most reliable national data on college cost, graduation, debt, and post-college earnings. This new College Scorecard empowers Americans to search for colleges based on what matters most to them and allows them to compare the value offered by different colleges to help improve their decision. Within the first year, the College Scorecard had nearly 1.5 million users, more than 10 times the users its predecessor had in a year. By giving developers access to an application program interface (API), dozens of other organizations have used the Scorecard data to launch new tools to support students in their college search and application processes.\nØ      Modernizing our immigration system. The U.S. Digital Service is supporting the U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) in digitizing the external application and internal review process for over seven million annual immigration applications and requests. Through the new my.USCIS.gov platformand Electronic Immigration System, an increasing percentage of the immigration system is now online, including the green card renewal application (I-90), which has a 93 percent user satisfaction rate. Improvements to software development practices, system architecture, and design will save millions of dollars per year in ongoing operations, maintenance, and licensing costs and make it easier for users to interact with the immigration system.\nØ      Helping to ensure access to affordable health care for millions of Americans. Since the 2013 Open Enrollment, the U.S. Digital Service has partnered with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to support the day-to-day operations and infrastructure of HealthCare.gov, helping millions of Americans gain access to affordable health coverage.\nØ      Developing a unified, one-stop shop digital experience for Veterans. Vets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use site that consolidates important resources for Veterans into one website — not thousands. Built in partnership with leaders at Veterans Affairs, Vets.gov launched in November 2015 in beta to provide tools and resources that are easy to find and use. Veterans are actively testing the site so the team can learn, as they build, what is working for Veterans and what is not.\nØ      Providing secure access to taxpayer information. Working with the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Digital Service introduced Secure Access, a user verification process that relies on strong identity proofing and two-factor authentication to protect users' sensitive tax records. Secure Access ensures that users have convenient, real-time access to their transcripts while protecting taxpayer information from automated fraudulent attacks.\nØ      Helping student borrowers more easily navigate the complexity of student loan repayment plans with StudentLoans.gov/Repay. To help borrowers easily navigate the complexity of student loan repayment plans, the U.S. Digital Service and the Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid launched StudentLoans.gov/Repay. Built mobile-first and using human-centered design, the site helps borrowers find their best repayment options in five steps or fewer.\nØ      Streamlining Veterans Affairs disability compensation processing with Caseflow Certification. Hundreds of thousands of Veterans have waited more than three years for a final disability compensation appeal decision, relying on a complex and cumbersome process. Working in collaboration with the VA's Board of Veterans Appeals, the U.S. Digital Service launched Caseflow Certification, a straightforward web-app to improve paperless appeals processing by detecting if required documentation has been added before an appeal can move forward. This simple check helps reduce preventable errors and avoidable delays caused by disjointed, manual processing.\nØ      Modernizing the Department of Defense (DoD) travel system. The Defense Travel System (DTS) is currently used by DoD's civilians and service members around the world, accounting for $3.5 billion in travel spending every year. The U.S. Digital Service is assisting in the transition of DTS over to a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. The new system — which is currently being piloted — has greatly improved usability, simplified travel policies, and has the potential for large cost saving potential.\nØ      Helping implement Medicare payment reform at the Department of Health and Human Services. The U.S. Digital Service is assisting CMS in the implementation of the new Quality Payment Program for Medicare under the bipartisan Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), legislation with a new approach that pays clinicians for the value and quality of care they provide.\nØ      Enabling the Precision Medicine Initiative to gain new insights for the development of individualized care. Announced by the President during the 2015 State of the Union, the Precision Medicine Initiative is a new effort to revolutionize how we improve health and treat disease by taking each unique person's genes, environment, and lifestyle into account. The U.S. Digital Service is working with the Department of Health & Human Services to enable this medical transformation, and partnering with the National Institutes of Health and Department of Veterans Affairs to build their volunteer research platforms and the supporting technology.\nØ      Helping to strengthen information security at the Department of Defense (DoD).  The Defense Digital Service launched a program called  Hack the Pentagon, the first bug bounty program in the history of the Federal Government, to strengthen the security of the DoD's digital assets. More than 1,400 outside researchers (commonly known across the technology industry as \"white hat hackers\") participated, and more than 250 submitted at least one vulnerability report. Of all the submissions received, 138 were determined to be legitimate, unique, and eligible for a bounty. These vulnerability reports were remediated in near-real time.\nØ      Collaborating with the Air Force to reduce project cost and schedule slip for the next generation of the U.S. Global Positioning System, or \"GPS.\" Working alongside DoD contractors, the U.S. Digital Service is automating configuration, testing, integration and deployment, as well as introducing DevOps methods. The next iteration of GPS will provide dramatic improvements to location accuracy and signal acquisition and support GPS capabilities for billions of people across the globe.\nØ      Improving the import and export system. The U.S. Digital Service is working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and partner agencies across the government to improve the stability and performance of a new system that will collect and process data on all imports and exports coming in to or leaving our country. The Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) is a modern electronic filing system that serves as a \"single-window\" through which all import and export documentation would be filed, vastly improving efficiency and the user experience.\nØ      Digitizing the refugee approval process for Federal agencies. The U.S. Digital Service worked with the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to launch a digital stamp approval process for Federal agencies processing refugees who have already been interviewed in-person and who have cleared all security and background checks. More than 57 percent of cases require this action, so having the flexibility to conduct it from any location at any time is a significant benefit. The digital stamp approval process is the team's first step towards modernizing the refugee admissions process by increasing officer efficiency and reducing wait time for applicants, while upholding rigorous security standards.\nRETHINKING HOW OUR GOVERNMENT BUYS & BUILDS DIGITAL SERVICES\nØ      Helping to transform Federal IT procurement. Working alongside teams at the Office of Management and Budget's Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and the General Services Administration, the U.S. Digital Service has built a dedicated acquisition team to improve the Federal Government's technology marketplace and help the government make better buying decisions. A few examples:\n•      The Small Business Administration (SBA) and U.S. Digital Service partnered to establish an agile procurement to modernize technology and streamline the certification process for small business owners. The resulting certify.SBA.gov saves small businesses time and money, and increases the SBA's capacity to provide small businesses access to the Federal contracting space. This acquisition was awarded in three months and serves as a baseline for the agile software development model.\n•      Developing resources such as TechFAR and the TechFAR Hub to help Federal agencies implement procurement best practices. The U.S. Digital Service launched an agile acquisition toolkit to provide agencies with a suite of tools for rapid procurement of agile software development. This helps the government more consistently procure high quality products for users, and maps a path between industry best practices and government regulation.\n•      Developing a digital IT acquisition professionals' community with the Digital Service Contracting Officer Training Challenge. Working with OFPP, the U.S. Digital Service posted on Challenge.gov asking for training program ideas to make contracting officers more successful in the era of digital government. The challenge winner created a training pilot to test with 30 contracting officers, who will complete the program empowered to act as business advisers to their agencies on digital service procurement.\nINITIATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMON PLATFORMS AND STANDARDS\nØ      Launched the Digital Services Playbook. This resource scales best practices from the private sector and government by highlighting 13 key \"plays\" for building more effective digital services.\nØ      Brought consistency and good user experience to government websites with the launch of the U.S. Web Design Standards. Built in partnership with 18F, this new User Interface (UI) system provides guidance for creating easy-to-use digital interfaces by unifying visual language and interaction patterns that meet high standards of web accessibility.\nØ      Developing a common identity management platform to provide a secure and user-friendly login process for the government's digital services. The U.S. Digital Service is working with 18F and a team of technologists across government to build Login.gov, a modern, user-friendly shared login service that has strong authentication and effective identity proofing technology.\nØ      Creating a window into the way people access the government online with the Digital Analytics Dashboard. The dashboard, developed in partnership with 18F, draws on data from across the government collected by the Digital Analytics Program. The U.S. Digital Service uses it to focus teams on the services that matter most to the American people.\nBRINGING TOP TECHNOLOGY TALENT INTO PUBLIC SERVICE\nØ      Recruited 170 (and growing) engineers, designers, product managers, and more to serve tours of duty with the Federal Government. More than 170 engineers, designers, data scientists, and product managers have answered the President's call and signed on for a tour of duty with the U.S. Digital Service. Because of the Administration's efforts in recruiting top technical talent, teams across the government are able to develop better digital services for the American people.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122662", "text": "\"[P]romoting religious freedom is a key objective of U.S. foreign policy. And I'm proud that no nation on Earth does more to stand up for the freedom of religion around the world than the United States of America.\"\n- President Barack Obama, February 6, 2014\nThroughout the Obama Administration, the U.S. Government has prioritized efforts to promote freedom of religion globally as a universal human right, a strategic national interest, and as a key foreign policy objective. The Administration has praised countries that have made strides to promote religious freedom, assisted governments in taking steps to address shortcomings, and denounced severe violators of religious freedom; provided support to individuals who have been persecuted on account of their beliefs, and advocated for the rights of religious minorities. The Obama Administration has also worked closely with civil society organizations, including religious communities, in promoting freedom of religion or belief for all people.\nThe Administration has leveraged the tools of U.S. diplomacy, foreign assistance funds, and other activities abroad to advance this goal, ensuring that efforts to promote and protect religious freedom are fully integrated into broader policies to ensure freedom and dignity for all people.\nThe Obama Administration's record on promoting and protecting religious freedom around the globe includes:\nAdvancing a Global Vision for International Religious Freedom\n•      In his  2009 speech at Cairo University, President Obama laid out a vision of the need for mutual respect and understanding across countries and societies, noting that, \"People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul.\"\n•      In a 2012 speech at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed: \"Religious freedom is not just about religion. It's not just about the right of Roman Catholics to organize a mass, or Muslims to hold a religious funeral, or Baha'is to meet in each other's homes for prayer, or Jews to celebrate High Holy Days together – as important as those rituals are. Religious freedom is also about the right of people to think what they want, say what they think, and come together in fellowship without the state looking over their shoulder.\"\n•      In  2012 remarks at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, then-Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough articulated the nexus between religious freedom and national security: \"Put simply, religious pluralism, tolerance and freedom can help promote stability, security, development and democratic progress. And the lack of religious freedom is itself destabilizing. ... For all these reasons, advancing religious freedom around the world is not only consistent with our values as Americans, it advances our national security interests. This is formalized in the President Obama's National Security Strategy.\"\n•      At the 2014 National Prayer Breakfast, President Obama noted, \"around the world freedom of religion is under threat. ... We see governments engaging in discrimination and violence against the faithful. We sometimes see religion twisted in an attempt to justify hatred and persecution. ...I've made the case that no society can truly succeed unless it guarantees the rights of all its peoples, including religious minorities... Going forward, we will keep standing for religious freedom around the world. And that includes, by the way, opposing blasphemy and defamation of religion measures, which are promoted sometimes as an expression of religion, but, in fact, all too often can be used to suppress religious minorities. We continue to stand for the rights of all people to practice their faiths in peace and in freedom. And we will continue to stand against the ugly tide of anti-Semitism that rears its ugly head all too often.\"\n•      During the  September 2015 visit of His Holiness Pope Francis, President Obama noted, \"[A]round the world, at this very moment, children of God...are targeted and even killed because of their faith. Believers are prevented from gathering at their places of worship. The faithful are imprisoned, and churches are destroyed. So we stand...in defense of religious freedom and interfaith dialogue, knowing that people everywhere must be able to live out their faith free from fear and free from intimidation.\"\n•      In an October 2015 statement, Secretary of State John Kerry noted that \"countries benefit when their citizens fully enjoy the rights to which they are entitled. And this is not a hopeful theory; this is a proven reality. No nation can fulfill its potential if its people are denied the right to practice, to hold, to modify, to openly profess their innermost beliefs.\"\n•      During his  February 2016 visit to a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland, President Obama said, \"if we're serious about freedom of religion...we have to understand an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths. And when any religious group is targeted, we all have a responsibility to speak up. And we have to reject a politics that seeks to manipulate prejudice or bias, and targets people because of religion... And just as faith leaders, including Muslims, must speak out when Christians are persecuted around the world – or when anti-Semitism is on the rise – because the fact is, is that there are Christians who are targeted now in the Middle East, despite having been there for centuries, and there are Jews who've lived in places like France for centuries who now feel obliged to leave because they feel themselves under assault –sometimes by Muslims. We have to be consistent in condemning hateful rhetoric and violence against everyone. And that includes against Muslims here in the United States of America.\"\n•      In  March 2016, Secretary Kerry announced that, in his judgment, \"Da'esh is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yezidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims. Da'esh is genocidal by self-proclamation, by ideology, and by actions – in what it says, what it believes, and what it does. Da'esh is also responsible for crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing directed at these same groups and in some cases also against Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and other minorities.\"\nSeizing Opportunities, Expanding U.S. Capacity to Promote Religious Freedom\n•      President Obama and other U.S. Government officials have and will continue to lift up the importance of religious freedom in countries around the world. President Obama has privately and publicly raised religious freedom on numerous occasions during his travels, including in addresses to the people of  Vietnam,  Cuba,  India,  China, and  Turkey. He has spoken out on the plight of persecuted religious minority communities, including  Rohingya Muslims in Burma,  Christians in the Middle East,  Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur Muslims in China,  Ahmadiyya Muslims in Pakistan, the  Baha'is in Iran, and  Coptic Christians. He has raised his voice on themes including  anti-Semitism,  anti-Muslim sentiments, U.S. opposition to  blasphemy  laws, and the  right to wear religious attire. And he has discussed the plight of religious communities with religious leaders including the  Dalai Lama,  Pope Francis and  Christian leaders from the Middle East. Similarly, in private diplomatic consultations, the President and other senior U.S. officials routinely express concerns to governments about abusive laws and policies negatively impacting on religious freedom, including with the leaders of China, Pakistan, and Egypt, among many others.\n•      One of the less-publicized aspects of U.S. efforts in recent years involves work helping obtain freedom for individual prisoners of conscience around the world. While in some cases we speak publicly about the plight of those imprisoned on account of their religious beliefs or activities, in many more instances, this work takes place behind the scenes, as U.S. officials quietly but vigorously lobby foreign officials to free specific individuals imprisoned for everything from blasphemy allegations to seeking conscientious objector status to vaguely defined charges of \"extremism.\" In every one of these instances, we must carefully weigh whether to work publicly or privately to achieve that person's release. Far too many people remain imprisoned for their religion or beliefs, but we have seen many individuals freed, in part through our efforts. For example, President Obama and other senior officials  repeatedly  called  for the  release of Christian Pastor Saeed Abedini, imprisoned in Iran in 2012, who was finally  able to return home to his Iowa church and community earlier this year. Similarly, after  repeated  calls for the release of Christian missionary Kenneth Bae, arrested in 2012, the North Korean government finally did so in 2014. Senior U.S. officials  strongly  condemned the death sentence of Meriam Ishag, a Christian convert for apostasy in Sudan, and were  delighted at her subsequent release.\n•      The Department of State's Office of International Religious Freedom today has more staff, resources and program funds than at any time since its creation under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. The Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom serves as a principal advisor to the President and Secretary of State on this critical topic. Since his appointment in January 2015, the current  Ambassador at Large has traveled to more than 25 countries, including five of the ten \"Countries of Particular Concern,\" meeting with government officials, parliamentarians, human rights activists, religious leaders, and believers from nearly all world religious traditions, along with skeptics and non-believers. In each country, he has pressed government officials to address shortcomings or partner with the United States in promoting universal respect for freedom of religion or belief.\n•      In 2013, the United States adopted a National Strategy on Integrating Religious Leader and Faith Community Engagement into U.S. foreign policy. This strategy acknowledge the significant contributions of religious leaders and faith communities to human rights, global health and development and conflict mitigation; and that the U.S. government should integrate more robust engagement with them into broader foreign policy activities. Accordingly, the Administration has worked closely with a diverse spectrum of religious and other civil society leaders to advance pluralism and human rights, including the protection of religious freedom. The State Department's Office of Religion and Global Affairs, established in 2013 by Secretary Kerry, and the Office of International Religious Freedom, along with U.S. Agency for International Development's Center for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, help implement the Strategy.\n•      When Pope Francis visited the United States in September 2015, the White House  announced a series of new commitments to advance religious freedom around the globe. Specifically, in the face of Da'esh atrocities in Iraq and Syria, the Administration appointed a Special Advisor for Religious Minorities in the Near East and South and Central Asia, to help ensure that the urgent needs of religious minority communities are taken into consideration in our military and humanitarian planning, and our multi-pronged efforts to assist in the return of these communities to their ancestral homes are implemented as expeditiously and efficiently as possible.\n•      During this Administration, the Department of State has dramatically increased training of American diplomats on religious freedom, including promoting best practices for engaging governments, drafting reports, and liaising effectively with civil society and religious communities. In 2011, the Department's Foreign Service Institute began offering a four-day course on Religion and Foreign Policy, which has to date reached over 250 American diplomats and local staff of U.S. embassies abroad. In 2015, the Department launched a two-day course on religious freedom, offered in multiple sessions at the Foreign Service Institute's regional training centers in Bangkok, Frankfurt, and Fort Lauderdale, reaching an additional 80 U.S. diplomats and embassy staff. The Department's religious freedom experts have also lectured on these topics at a range of other courses, including for training U.S. Army Chaplains at Fort Jackson, South Carolina.\n•      The Obama Administration has redoubled efforts to ensure that government officials who are found to have engaged in particularly severe violations of religious freedom cannot obtain visas to enter the United States, as required under  Section 212(a)(2)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n•      The Administration has revitalized the \"Countries of Particular Concern\" mechanism provided under the International Religious Freedom Act by regularizing the announcement and designation of CPCs, and by making the list dynamic through the addition of two new countries to the list of the world's worst religious freedom offenders.\n•      The Administration has continued efforts to enhance the accuracy and rigor of the annual International Religious Freedom Reports, which describe in detail the status of religious freedom in every country of the world.\nCoalition-Building and Multilateral Efforts\n•      After years of fighting efforts in the United Nations calling for criminalization of speech alleged to be insulting or offensive to religion (i.e. blasphemy laws), the U.S. Government in March 2011 helped to forge global consensus on a landmark new approach, embodied in UN Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18. This resolution calls for efforts to combat religiously-motivated intolerance, discrimination, and violence in ways that do not infringe on the fundamental freedoms of expression or religion. Since that resolution's adoption, the U.S. government has participated in a series of annual multilateral expert-level meetings aimed at identifying best practices for implementation of the actions called for in the resolution.\n•      In 2015, the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom and his Canadian counterpart launched the International Contact Group on Freedom of Religion or Belief, an initiative that now includes over 25 likeminded governments working in coordination on strategies to promote and protect religious freedom across the world, and developing reinforcing strategies and tactics. In May 2016, the State Department convened a meeting of the International Contact Group to discuss next steps and plan a way forward for collective action.\n•      In July 2016, the Department of State hosted a major international conference on the global Response to Threats to Religious and Ethnic Minorities under Da'esh, which brought officials from over 30 governments and scores of civil society organizations and religious representatives together to discuss new steps to safeguard religious diversity in Iraq and Syria.\n•      In 2015, the United States partnered with the EU, Israel, and Canada to organize the first-ever UN General Assembly meeting on combatting anti-Semitism, in which 47 countries and organizations participated and many spoke out against rising world-wide anti-Semitism.\nSupporting Religious Freedom Advocates through Foreign Assistance Funds\n•      Over the course of this Administration, the Administration has dedicated tens of millions of dollars to foreign assistance programs to promote greater respect for religious freedom and to combat abuses, with $16 million in such activities currently ongoing.\n•      Through emergency funding mechanisms, the Department of State assists individuals and religious advocates facing egregious persecution for their belief or non-belief by providing assistance for critical needs such as legal fees, dependent support, and security-related relocation. The Department of State also provides small grants to defenders of religious freedom including legal and political advocates and NGO advocacy networks to build their capacity to protect religious freedom when it is under attack.\n•      In 2016, the Smithsonian Institution and Department of State collaborated to launch a program to assist religious minority communities in northern Iraq with cultural heritage preservation. Also in cooperation with the Smithsonian, State funding has led to the development of materials to train the Kurdish Peshmerga forces on identifying mass graves and cultural heritage sites. Department of State funding has also supported a partnership with an NGO to examine satellite telemetry and use geospatial analysis to identify potential mass gravesites located in areas under Da'esh control.\n•      Since 2013, the Departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security have  collaborated on an innovative effort to assist governments worldwide in training local officials on legal and policy protections for religious freedom, particularly regarding engagement with members of religious minorities and enforcement of non-discrimination laws. Such trainings have taken place in half a dozen countries so far, with several more in the planning stages.\n•      Additional foreign assistance programs focus on topics including: mitigating societal or sectarian violence, minimizing legal or other restrictions of the right to the freedom of religion, training civil society and government officials on the legal and policy protections for religious freedom, strengthening the capacity of civil society and religious leaders to track religious freedom violations and conduct advocacy to stop them, and combatting drivers of violent extremism in key countries. Here are some examples:\no      In the Central African Republic, the Department of State supports early warning programs to increase effective communication and community resilience across religious lines. These programs seek to create networks of trust across communities, using traditional and religious leaders along with youth who are specially trained in de-escalation techniques, constructive engagement, and provide leaders with early warning about potential triggering events that could lead to violence and contribute to long term tensions.\no      A Department of State grant has empowered NGOs in Eastern and Central Europe to monitor anti-Semitic expression appearing in traditional and new media, and to counter such attitudes through fact-based messages and acts of inclusion. The NGOs have used findings from the media monitoring to create cartoons, posters and other media products to counter anti-Semitism. Additional programs support the establishment of grassroots coalitions to combat xenophobic attitudes and behavior. These coalitions have been able to effectively combat xenophobia and advocate for more societal acceptance toward religious minorities.\no      In countries in East Asia, the Department of State supports programs that strengthen legal protections for religious freedom. Through these programs, lawyers learn strategic practices with regard to setting precedents, citing international human rights cases and agreements, and creating networks of like-minded jurists who are specially trained in religious liberty case-law. Through these efforts, minorities are able to expect to receive adequate counsel that is respectful of their religious or ethnic traditions when faced with governmental or societal discrimination or persecution.\no      In Central Asia, the Department of State supports NGO efforts to build networks of religious leaders with the aim of helping them more effectively coordinate policy advocacy around issues of mutual interest or concern. Such efforts have included bringing religious leaders together in order to better understand their individual concerns, and to promote increased trust and mutual understanding among leaders from different faith traditions.\nComing Together and Taking Action\n•      In 2011, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched a Strategic Dialogue with Civil Society, which included a working group on Religious Freedom, Security, and Democracy. Through this effort, U.S. officials collaborated with religious leaders and faith communities as well as other civil society leaders to develop strategies to promote religious freedom, and address issues of conflict prevention and mitigation, development and interreligious dialogue. The working group provided recommendations to the Department of State aimed toward strengthening its approach to religious freedom and engagement with religious communities, many of which have been adopted.\n•      To build greater understanding and a spirit of inclusion among youth around the world, the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat anti-Semitism and Special Representative to Muslim Communities, launched the Hours Against Hate campaign, asking young people to pledge to spend at least one hour helping out people who don't look like them or pray like them. The campaign went viral, as young people around the world committed to spend tens of thousands of hours walking in someone else's shoes.\n•      The Department of State in 2010 and 2013 sponsored trips of prominent American and international imams and Muslim scholars to Dachau and Auschwitz with the Special Envoys to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism and Special Envoy to the Organization of the Islamic Conference. The imams released public statements condemning Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism after both trips.\n•      Under the prior Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, the Female Faces of Faith initiative aimed to holistically integrate female religious actors into U.S. policy and engagement by more comprehensively highlighting religious freedom violations in which women were particularly susceptible; emphasizing the role women play in mitigating religiously motivated conflict and countering violent extremism; and advocating for reform of personal status codes that disadvantage women.\n•      U.S. diplomats and development professionals work with host governments and local populations globally to address discriminatory laws, support affirmative steps, and to encourage more inclusive policies. We continue to work in partnership with like-minded governments, civil society organizations, religious leaders, and the private sector to advance respect for freedom of religion or belief for all.\n•      U.S. Embassies, Consulates, and USAID Missions engage religious communities to understand their concerns and to discuss U.S. foreign policy priorities with them.", "timestamp": "2016-08-10", "title": "Fact Sheet: Promoting and Protecting Religious Freedom Around the Globe"}

Thank you very much. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you. [applause]\nAmazing. Amazing. What great people.\nWe're going to bring back our jobs to Pennsylvania. We're going to bring back our jobs to the United States. [applause]\nGoing to bring back our jobs, folks. I've looked at the numbers and I see what's happening in Pennsylvania. I see what's happening all over our country.\nYou look at New York state, you look at New England, you look anywhere in the country where you want to go to, all over it's the same. Manufacturing way down, jobs way down. You go to other countries, they're taking our companies, they're taking our jobs.\nPeople are right now working harder than they've ever worked. Eighteen years ago they made more money in real wages, 18 years, think of it. Eighteen years ago many of the people in this incredibly big room, and thank you for being here, you know it's 93 degrees out. [applause]\nAnd they still have a lot of people trying to get in, I don't know if they can get them in. Should we let them in? Just let them in. [applause]\nBut 18 years ago, people were making more money in real wages than they make today. And today they're working two jobs, some people are working three jobs. So they're older, and they're working harder, and they're making less money, all right? A friend of mine, I've been telling this story over the last month because it's better than going to Wharton or better than going to Harvard and asking them to do a study, because you learn it in three minutes.\nBut let me just tell you. Right now, Mexico and other countries are building facilities, plants, the likes of which you've never seen. We're going to build the wall, don't worry, we're going to build the wall, we're going to build it, we're going to build it. [applause]\nBut a friend of mine, and actually a supporter, big supporter, great guy. He builds plants, that's what he does, he builds plants. He doesn't want to build apartments, he doesn't want to build office buildings, he wants to build plants. And he's just about the biggest there is. And I said how are things going? He said very well, how are you doing in the U.S.? Not good. How are you doing in Mexico?\nHe said Donald do you want to see, it's the eighth wonder of the world. They are building plants, the likes of which I've never seen. He's building some of the greatest plants, big—you look at Ford moving vast operations to Mexico. The plants. You look at—look at, take a look. By the way, millions of jobs, thousands of companies over the years, they've left us. And we have a few things. We have unemployment, we have empty plants, I saw up in New York state, I saw it in Pennsylvania, you were great to meet, you voted a big victory for Donald Trump, thank you. [applause]\nThat was a big victory. I mean I assumed I was going—if I don't win Pennsylvania—and by the way, I was talking to our great Congressman, and where is he? He's here some place, where is he? [applause]\nHe loves the people, and I have to say, of all of Pennsylvania he wants to see this state do well. Thank you. But just talking back to a few of my friends that live here, we have a few of the friends and we see what's happened with General Electric where they're cutting way back. Not going to happen. And you know why they're cutting back, it's one reason. Because we don't take care of our miners and we're not producing coal.\nAnd they don't need to make those big, big beautiful, you could call them locomotives I guess, right? Whatever the hell they are, they're big and they're powerful and they don't need them like they used to because we don't make our government work for us. They're not working for us. They're working for others, they're not working for us. So when General Electric goes out and you see the numbers, I see the numbers, and it's about coal, so I just left parts of Virginia and West Virginia, and the coal industry's decimated.\nThe miners are out of work, they're totally out of work. I mean there will be no such thing as coal in this country pretty soon. And we're talking clean coal, we're talking clean coal.\nSo I was with the miners, we have such tremendous support, West Virginia, the mining parts of Virginia. All over, Ohio, because Hillary Clinton made the statement not so long ago. A number of months she said, we're going to put the mines and miners out of business. All right? Going to put the mines and the miners – so [booing]\nSo, we're not going to let that happen. We're not going to let that happen and we're not going to let it happen in Pennsylvania because you know what? A lot of your miners have already lost their jobs, but you have a lot of other jobs that are very reliant on the mines. Like, as an example, General Electric. And what we're going to do, folks, is going to be so special. We're going to bring it back. We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to bring back our companies. [applause]\nWhen a company wants to leave our country to go to another country and think they're going to make their product, and because our politicians are weak, stupid, taken care of by lobbyists, special interests—they're taken care of by lobbyists, they're taken care of by donors and special interests. That's what—you know, a friend of mine—very smart guy—said—I can't believe it. We're talking about a deal that took place about a month ago.\nHe said, I can't believe they could have gotten that through. I said, Why can't you believe it? Well, it's so bad for the country. I said, Yeah, but it's good for the politician because they're taken care of by their lobbyists and their donors and the special interests.\nSo even though you say we want, as an example, General Electric to produce more, if they don't want to or if for some reason one of the donors of crooked Hillary Clinton doesn't want that to happen, even though it's great for Erie, even though it's great you, even though it's great for the state of Pennsylvania, then it's not going to happen, folks. It's not going to happen.\nAnd by the way—and I have to tell you this. So when they think they're going to take our companies are rip them out of—as an example—this area or this state or any other state and go to Mexico and build massive new plants and employ people other than you, and you're going to lose your jobs or you're going to now get two part- time jobs that don't add up to half of what you used to make. That stuff isn't happening anymore. So here's what happens. They're going to build that plant. Now, if I were here five years ago and if President Obama put me and maybe secretary of keeping business in the United States—that's my title, secretary of keeping business in the United States. [applause]\nI mean, I like the sound of secretary of defense better. Oh, and by the way, we're going to build our military. We're going to be very strong. [applause]\nReally. And we're going to take care of our vets. We're going to take care of our vets, believe me. [applause]\nBut I like the sound—I like the sound of secretary of Defense. I like the sound of secretary of the Treasury. I like the sound of secretary of State. But I'll tell you, would I be good at keeping jobs over here. Would I be... [applause]\nI'll tell you this. I just have to say the Bernie Sanders protesters were much, much stronger. They had much more passion, I have to say. [applause]\nAll right. You know what's interesting? If I could speak to them for like five minutes—we want a strong military, we want to take care of our people, we want good education, we want good housing, we want good healthcare. What do we want? We're all in for the same thing. [applause]\nReally amazing. Really amazing. So I'll be your secretary of keeping companies in the United States, right? So, I would go to a company like Carrier Air Conditioner, which decided to leave Indianapolis, Indiana, and I would say here's the story.\nWe think it's wonderful that you're negotiating with Mexico. I'm sure you're going to have a wonderful plant, but here's what's going to happen. If you build that plant and you fire all of these people, 1400 people who were so great to me.\nIndiana, I won that in a landslide. Actually, the timing was good. I won it in a landslide because I know what to do. Hillary doesn't know what to do. Did you see her yesterday? She has no clue about what we're talking about. Folks, she has no clue. She has no clue. Crooked Hillary. She doesn't know anything about it and, by the way, if she did, she couldn't do it anyway because her donors don't want to do it. There's reasons.\nBut look, look. I would go to them and say just to keep them. Just to keep them. And I wouldn't even care that much. I'll tell you why. Ready? I'd say here's the story.\nIf you leave, in this case, Indianapolis, you're going to go to Mexico, you're going to make your air conditioning units. Every single unit that you make that crosses our now very, very strong border we're going to charge you 35 percent of the cost of that unit. OK? Thirty five percent. Right?\nSo simple. Thirty five percent the cost of that unit. We hope you enjoy your new plant. Very hot weather out there, very hot. We hope you enjoy your new plant, but 35 percent is coming to us. Now, here's what's going to happen if they haven't moved yet. A lot of them have moved.\nWe've lost thousands and thousands of companies, we've lost millions of jobs - too late. I should have been there 10 years ago. Nobody would have left. Nobody would have left because you need the right messenger, you know, I'm your messenger in terms of this movement.\nBut you need the right person saying it. So, here's what's going to happen. Normally they'd call up whoever it is that was putting the little order down like the new president and they'd have one of their lobbyists call up and they'd say Hillary, I'm sorry, you can't do that, they gave you $2 million for your campaign. Can't do that, Hillary. OK, I won't do that.\nWith me, I'm putting my money up, folks. I'm putting my money up. Putting my money up. We're raising money for Reince and for the RNC, but that's for a lot of other reasons. We are putting - I'm putting a lot of money up. I financed my - I funded, not financed, I wish I financed, right? I funded but I funded my primaries and I spent less than anybody else in terms of the measures. So, here's a story - wouldn't that be nice?\nI spent less and won in a landslide. Other people spent much, much more. Three, four, five times more and they came in seventh. Who the hell do you want to have as your president, right? Right? Right? Oh, boy, and then they don't like me - couple of them, most of them have really supported us, but some of them just can't get over it. You know what I say to them? Get over it. We're just having fun. Get over it.\nYou signed a pledge, I hereby guarantee that I will endorse whoever wins - you know, the funny thing, all those pledges, you know they were signed for different - they were signed so that I would sign it. And I would have honored it, I will say. Even if I wasn't fond or didn't like - I would have honored it because a pledge is a very important thing. But here's the thing. So, we are going to take these companies that haven't left - now, I'm looking at your numbers folks, you're not doing too well.\nYou're not doing too well here. Pennsylvania has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since - you know, that's massive, since NAFTA. NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton and I believe it's the single worst trade document ever signed in the history of our country and probably in the history of our world.\nIt's one of the most one-sided documents that I've ever seen. And it allowed Mexico and places to do unbelievably well at our expense. And did you see where say, I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA, I'm going to—TPP disaster. Ok, don't worry. Don't worry.\nAnd Hillary was in favor of TPP. She said it's the gold standard. Thank you for reminding me. I like this guy. It's the gold standard. TPP. Transpacific Partnership. It is going to be—I don't think you can be worse than NAFTA honestly. But it's going to be as bad as NAFTA. So TPP, she said it is the gold standard. She's reading it from a teleprompter. It is the gold standard—oh, boy. Our country is in trouble. Our country is in trouble. Our country is in trouble.\nSo she said it's the gold standard. But when she heard me make a speech, as I understand it. And she heard me talking very negatively about it. As an example, they don't talk devaluation, which is the single greatest tool that these countries are using to kill the United States, including China. They devalue their currency. Well, it doesn't happen. Number one thing is not mentioned.\nSo complicated, this agreement. Too many countries. By the way, I believe trade. I believe in trade deals. One country at a time. Boom. Boom. Boom. You got to see the lines. We'll have one line. And if they don't do well.\nIf they don't behave themselves, if they want to start devaluing their currency all over the place, very simple, we write them a notice like we do in business. We serve them with a 30 day notice. [applause]\nAnd by the way, you just saw, how great are our police, right? [applause]\nLaw and order. We need law and order. We need law and order and we will have law and order. Our police, our firemen - but our police do a fantastic job. They are not recognized for the great job they do. If they have 500,000 incidents all positively, beautifully handled, one bad thing happens, that one bad thing is on the news for two weeks and it's a disgrace. It's a disgrace.\nSo we should be very thankful for the job they do. So, Pennsylvania is losing a lot of its business. Right now, we're sitting here, we're talking - oh, here's another one. Go home to Mom. Go home to Mom. [applause]\nAnd your mother is voting for trump! She's voting for Trump. It's true. It's true.\nBy the way, just to interject - so I was told this whole area is Democratic, meaning Democrat. And I was told that by a lot of different people outside and then they said I can't believe that you have 10,000 people, you have people outside trying to get in.\nThey said, the came up to me, this is - happens to be a Democrat who I happen to know is a good guy—came up to me and said I've never seen anything like it. It always goes Democrat. Is that a correct statement? Said, you are going to win Erie in a and the surrounding area - you're going to win in a landslide. Gonna be a landslide. [applause]\nBecause people are tired of lies, they're tired of losing their jobs, they're tired of seeing their companies being ripped out and going to other places. They're tired of China coming in and dropping steel all over the place to put your companies out of business, so we have to go to China to get our steel, which is happening very quickly.\nAnd that's why the steel workers are with me, that's why the miners are with me, that's why the working people, electricians, the plumbers, the sheetrockers, the concrete guys and gals, they're all - they're with us.\nAnd I grew up, you know they say, you know you're really rich, how come you sort of relate to these people? Well, my father built houses and I used to work in these houses and I got to know the electricians, I got to know all these people, I got to know the plumbers, the steamfitters—I got to know them all.\nAnd I liked them better than the rich people that I know. I know a lot of rich people. It's true. They're better. I like them better.\nSo, anyway—and, we are going to put people back to work. We're not playing games. And it's going to go quickly. By the way, it's going to go quickly.\nBut look at this, OK. So, Erie, has lost one in three manufacturing jobs. You know that, all I—you do—I flew over, you're looking at the plants, plants that 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, some two years ago, were vibrant.\nBut no plant two years ago was too vibrant because it was down to half, down to a quarter, down to a tenth, and then ultimately they closed, but you see them. They are falling over. The rain, the sleet, the snow, the wind. These are great buildings that are falling apart. Don't feel bad, all over the country. Upstate New York is a disaster, which Hillary Clinton said that she was going to fix.\nOK, so the Washington Post is extraordinarily dishonest and that's fine. But they wrote a story, I couldn't believe I saw this story, they talked about Hillary Clinton. It was a headline, Hillary Clinton and when she ran for the United States Senator from New York, she said to the people in upstate New York, which was starting to really have problems because of her husband's bill NAFTA.\nAnd companies were leaving, tremendous unemployment, tremendous problems, making nothing and she said I will turn it around, I will create 200,000 jobs, we're going to do a great job. Guess what? She got elected, she did nothing. And the only ones that benefited were the consultants and the people that helped her out. It is a disaster. upstate New York is right now worse than anything you have in the state of Pennsylvania, she did nothing.\nAnd I watched her yesterday, which was hard to do, because she is boring, OK? [applause]\nI watched her yesterday talking about—you know what's funny? I said I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA and they said what happens if you can't make a deal, I said we're going to terminate, we're getting out. And [applause]\nSo I've been saying that and I've been saying we're going to renegotiate different trade deals, and we're going to make great trade deals and all this and she's never said that. All of a sudden, two days ago, I will renegotiate trade deals. She's not going to do it, folks. She's going to renegotiate trade deals the same way she was going to put 200,000 jobs in upstate New York.\nIt turned out to be a total fantasy and I have to tell you, I respect the Washington Post for writing one bad story. Because you what they're doing? And Reince was alluding to it a little bit, the only way she gets elected is if they don't report on her. They don't show her. They have me on so much television. There's CNN, you talk about dishonesty, it's called the Clinton—wait—it's called the Clinton News Network, CNN. Now, think of it, Clinton is[applause]\nShe's hardly ever on. So yesterday, they have yesterday, a scandal with the emails, another one. I'm not talking about the 33,000 emails that she deleted or got rid of. Can you imagine what was on those emails? Can you imagine? I love that. Can you imagine what was on those emails, 33,000 emails were deleted. And she said well it had to do with the wedding and yoga.\nI give two to yoga, I give five to the wedding. I'll tell you, the lies, the deception. We're running like they run right now a third world country folks, OK? You saw what happened, it's running like a third world country, we're being talked about all over the world, nobody can believe it.\nIn fact, when they were going over the charges against Hillary Clinton, one after another after another after another, however, and yet other people, their lives have been destroyed for doing much less, all right?\nTheir lives have been destroyed. So now they have a big scandal in New York. It's in the New York papers, but very little. Pay right? Pay for play. And it's horrifying, it's horrifying. Our government is for sale. Our government is for sale by a crooked person. And what they're doing is they're trying to not talk about her. Take a look. You go to CNN as an example. Story after story about Trump. Story—Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump.\nAnd yesterday, it was announced that people are tired of negative—the hit jobs and CNN's starting to do very poorly. That's good. I like that. I like that. And I have to say, Fox has been treating us fairly. Fox has been fair. But CNN has been catastrophic. It's so dishonest.\nBut somebody was explaining to me their theory. If they don't report on her, people aren't going to know how bad she is. Look at her news conference. She hasn't had a news conference in like 260 days. That last one wasn't a news conference. That was a few of her friends. They asked her a question. What did she say about the circuit, right? Let me tell you, if I ever said that, short- circuited, if I ever said I short-circuited, it would be headlines all over the world. They would call for the death penalty. [applause]\nCan you imagine if I said that I short-circuited? I mean, I stand up here for months in front of massive crowds, she gets 300 people going to her events. She gets 300 people and then she reads something from a teleprompter and then she leaves and she goes home and she goes to sleep. [applause]\nAnd then she wakes and she goes again. And I'm telling you—and nobody does anything about it. Now me, I stand up here—I'm not looking at notes. I'm not reading teleprompters. Not easy. Not easy. Not easy. [applause]\nBut—but—remember—but—and if I make one mistake [inaudible] say, he mention something wrong. He got a wrong date. It's like headlines all over. She can say she short-circuited up here. I don't want a president who short-circuits. Is that OK? I don't want it. I don't want a president who short-circuits. [applause]\nWe've got to deal with ISIS. We've got to deal with China. We've got to deal with lots of people. They're not short-circuiting. But I don't want somebody that short-circuits. So let me just tell you—let me just tell you.\nOver the last little while—you know, every time, it's always a big deal. When I said that Obama—and of course, I'm being sarcastic. And they know that because after I said that, I said he's the MVP, he's going to collect his MVP award. OK.\nSo I said Obama is the founder of ISIS. The founder. [applause]\nAnd these dishonest media people—they're the most dishonest people. They said oh, did he mean that? Didn't he mean that? And after that, I'd say a lot—in fact, they like him so much because he's been so weak and so bad. I mean, he let this happen. They had eight states. They had eight countries. They're now in 28 countries. They're expanding.\nSo I said the founder of—obviously, I'm being sarcastic. Then—then—but not that sarcastic, to be honest with you. [applause]\nAnd they all said, he should not say that. They should call him an enabler. Call him an enabler. He's an enabler. I said, that doesn't sound the same. He's an enabler. People are going to say what's—these people are the worst. But listen, so I said the founder of ISIS. And in fact, very soon he's going over to pick up his most valuable player award. Did I say that? I say it all the time. TRUMP: So they knew I was being sarcastic. By now they're analyzing. Did I really mean that? How could I say that? These people are the lowest form of life. I'm telling you. The lowest. [applause]\nThey are the lowest form of humanity. Not all of them. They have about 25 percent that are pretty good, actually. But most of them.\nOK. So, here's the story. So Erie has lost a lot. Right? You know that, right? Hang in, don't leave. I promise we can fix it so fast. We will stop these countries from taking our jobs. We will stop these countries from taking our companies. Hold on.\nOur jobs will come back. Now, I came up with a great plan. I'm lowering corporate taxes so our companies stay, so I don't even have to make the call. The corporate inversions - you know, we have companies that have, they say, two and a half trillion dollars outside of our comp - they can't get their money back. We don't let them.\nEverybody agrees that we should do it. Republicans, Democrats, everybody agrees.\nWhat's the - look, why do we not want them to bring money back? You know why? Because we don't have a president that can sit the leaders of both parties around a table and in about five minutes let them say let's bring this money back in so we can work it in this country, right?\nThat's what it is. So we're going to bring that money back in, we're going to lower taxes, we're going to keep our companies - and if our companies want to leave, they're going to pay a nice big beautiful tax to get their product back in.\nOK? That's what's going to happen. So, the existing U.S. trade deficit with TPP participating nations has already cost Pennsylvania 68,000 jobs, folks. No more, folks.\nWe're not going to be stupid people any more, we're going to be the really, really smart people. It's going to be America first. America first. America first. First. [applause]\nSo, the destruction of manufacturing in Pennsylvania was caused by Hillary Clinton's and her husband's disastrous trade policies.\nI mean, you take a look at what she's done. At the bidding of her corporate funders, Hillary Clinton has backed every job-killing trade deal for decades. She has received so much money, she has approved virtually every tax increase put before her.\nYesterday - you see 1.3 trillion in tax increases. We're the highest taxed nation in the land, essentially. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Anywhere in the world.\nAnd of the industrialized nations, we're far and away the highest taxed nation. And she's proposing a massive tax increase. Folks, we can't do it. It's going to make our country non-competitive - it's already non-competitive.\nIt's going to make our country non-competitive and we're not going to do it. I'm proposing a massive tax decrease for the middle class, for business, and businesses are going to pour in - not since Ronald Reagan has anything like this been proposed.\nBusinesses instead of leaving because their taxes are so high, they're going to stay. I might not even have to make those calls. Now, if I do, I will, meaning my people will. I'll do some, I love doing it. I would love telling some guy you're not moving. Well, Mr. President, sir, we would like to move to Mexico. You're not moving and if you do you pay the 35 percent tax. You say Well, in that case, I'm not moving, I'm not moving. In that case, I'm not moving. So easy.\nSo, your coal industry, your steel industry, which has been ravaged, your General Electrics of the world, which have been ravaged, just ravaged, we're going to end it and I'll tell you why. Over the years, I've watched. For years, for 10 years, for 12 years, for 15 years, beyond Obama, and I've watched as politicians talked about stopping countries from leaving - companies from leaving our states. You need strength, is right.\nOur states. And I watched. Remember they give the low-interest loans? Here's a low-interest loan if you stay in Pennsylvania, here's a zero-interest loan, you don't have to pay, here's a this, here's tax abatement of any kind you want, we'll help your - it doesn't work, folks, that's not what they need. They have money.\nThey want to go out, they want to move to another country and because our politicians are so dumb, they want to sell their product to us and not have any retribution, not have any consequences.\nSo all of that's over and I think you understand it and Hillary can't do it. Number one, she can't do it because the mentality isn't there. She can't do it. No, the mentality.\nYou know, she said fairly recently, I don't like Donald Trump's tone. His tone isn't nice. And I said, here we have a country that's being taken advantage of by every country in the world. Our businesses are being taken. Our jobs being taken. Everything's being taken.\nHere we have a world where ISIS is chopping off the heads of Christians and many others, drowning people in steel cages, burying people in the sand, and we have somebody up there who wants to be our president that says, I don't like Donald Trump's tone. [applause]\nFolks, we better get smart, folks. Hey, look, let's see what happens. We better get smart. We better get smart. [applause]\nWe better get smart. We better get tough. And if we're not smart and we're not tough, we're not going to have a country left. And one of the things I have to talk to you about before I leave is our borders. Illegal immigrants are pouring into our country. In fact, I brought something for you people. I brought—I brought—I had to do this. I didn't want to depress you. OK, look. The Clinton legacy.\nNearly one in three manufacturing jobs in Erie, PA—Erie, PA, sound familiar—have been lost since Clinton allowed a certain deal with China to happen. Now, look at this—look at this chart. This is 2001, not long ago. This is now. Congratulations, folks. I hope you're doing well. OK? I hope you're doing well. I don't want to hurt them. I hope you're doing well.\nBut you know what? You can't do well. When you have a government that is so stupid, that is so—that is so incompetent, you can't do it. Here's another one, folks. This is what we're talking about. Syrian refugees—we have no idea who they are, where they're coming from, no paperwork. You saw what happened in San Bernardino. You saw what happened—frankly, take a look at all over the world. Take a look at what's happening.\nIf we don't get smart and we don't get smart fast—Barack Obama is allowing Syrian refugees to come into our country by the thousands. Now, I have as big a heart as anybody in this room and I want to build safe zones and I want, by the way, the Gulf states to pay for it because they've got plenty of money and they're not doing much. OK? We'll supervise it. OPM, other people's money. We'll supervise it, right? We'll supervise it.\nBut they're going to pay for it because we're protecting these people. If it weren't for the United States, those countries wouldn't even exist. They'd be gone. The power we have is so enormous, but we have people that don't know what they're doing. We have an incompetent president. We have people that don't know what they're doing.\nSo look at this. Look at this. Syrian refugees admitted to the United States on a monthly basis. Look what's happening. Look what's happening. [booing]\nNow, in all fairness, we want to help people. Can't take a chance. San Bernardino, they walk in. They start shooting. Paris, the best, the toughest gun laws in the world, Paris, France. They walk in. They kill 130 people. They wound so gravely hundreds of people.\nNow, let me just tell you because well—we're on the Second Amendment, right, Second Amendment. If we had in San Bernardino—if we had in San Bernardino or in Orlando or someplace, somebody in that room like this guy right here, right, or that guy with the blue make America great again hat on or the one with the red make America—or that woman with the beautiful blonde hair. I wish I had hair that looked like that. [applause]\nBut if we had somebody and they happened to have a gun, San Bernardino, they see him come in—first of all, if they knew there was a gun where the bullets would be flying in the other direction, they probably wouldn't have got [inaudible] in, OK? But let's assume they did.\nThe carnage would not have been what the carnage was. We have to protect our Second Amendment. Hillary Clinton wants to kill our second amendment. [applause]\nShe wants to kill it. [applause]\nSo here's our chart. And I was thinking about doing a—I bring—every once in a—like, one in ten I do it, you know a lot of these. I love the people. We have such a movement going on. Who likes the snake? Do you know the snake? Do you like it? Who likes the snake? Here we are with this. We know bad things are going to happen. We know as we allow more and more people to come in from these terror areas, bad things are going to happen.\nHas anybody heard the snake? Not that many? Should I do it again? So think of this, folks, think of this, think of it. This is what is going on in our country with our borders. And by the way, we're going to have a strong border, we're going to have a wall, it's going to be a powerful wall that Mexico's going to pay for the wall. [applause]\nAnd we have no choice, and we have no choice. But think of this. This is now a situation where this was written by Al Wilson many years ago and I read it and I said you know that really pertains to what's happening to the United States and it has to do with being fooled, it has to do with a lot of different things but when you're listening to this, think of our border, think of the people that we're letting in by the thousands and Hillary Clinton, you saw those numbers right? With the chart, it's through the roof.\nHillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more coming into our country. How stupid are we? So, are you ready, you ready, you like it, you sure? On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake, his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. Oh well, she cried, I'll take you in and I'll take care of you.\nTake me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake, take me in oh tender woman, sighed the broken snake. She wrapped him up, all cozy, in a curvature of silk. Then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. Now she hurried home from work that night. As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she'd taken in, had been revived. Take me in oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.\nTake me in oh tender woman, sighed the broken snake. Now she clutched him to her bosom. You're so beautiful, she cried. But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you certainly would have died. Now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite. Take me in oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.\nTake me in oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake. I saved you, I saved you, I saved you, cried that woman. And you've bit me, heaven's why. You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die. Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin. You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in. [applause]\nGet ready folks, get ready. We're led by stupid people. We're led by leaders and you know honestly, I didn't need this. This I didn't need. I had a nice life, built a great company—a great company, some of the great real estate assets of the world. I may never see them. You know if I win, I may never see them again, and I love them—all over the world.\nBut you know what? This is so important. And I watched what was happening with the Iran deal, and I watched what was happening with jobs, and I watched what was happening with trade where China makes $500 billion in trade deficits with us.\nI look and I saw. Take a look at Mexico. You know, the politicians say, you'll never, ever be able to get Mexico to allow you to build a wall. I say trust me. Now, they don't say that anymore. Now they say, they won't put the money up to build a wall. So easy. Mexico—our trade deficit is massive, massive. They make a fortune off the stupidity of the United Stated.\nMexico will 100 percent—you hear—100 percent pay for the wall, 100 percent. [applause]\nOK? One hundred percent. But the story of the snake is what's happening to our country. We're letting people in. Many of these people hate us. Many of these people don't have good thoughts. And you see what one person can do—one sick wacko can do in Orlando. And then you see his father sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big smile on his face—with a big, fat smile on his face, right?\nAnd he was wearing a red hat, and I said, I hope that's not one of my hats. It wasn't. I was concerned. I saw that hat. I said, I hope it doesn't say make America great again. Bad guy—bad guy. Horrendous son—horrendous son.\nSo here's the story, folks. We have to win—we have to win Pennsylvania, so important. So [applause]\nHillary Clinton is run by people that do this very professionally. They're very good. They keep her out of the spotlight. She doesn't talk to reporters—very rarely. She doesn't do press conferences. She doesn't expose whatever's going on up here. She doesn't—which isn't good. She doesn't expose her mind to questions. And what they want to do is they want to try and fake it through.\nWe need strength. We need toughness. We need a strong temperament. We need a strong tone. At the same time—at the same time, let me tell you—at the same time, we need real, big, beautiful heart because we have to straighten out healthcare. Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced.\nIt's going to repay—did you see—did you see what's happening with Obamacare? Did you see where the numbers are going up 30, 40, and 50 percent? Wait until you see what happens on November 1st. Now, on November 1st, they're trying to delay it.\nBut you're going to get increases, the likes of which probably no country, nobody has ever seen. OK? Anybody in the history of healthcare—in Texas, through going through Blue Cross Blue Shield, they just had almost a 50 percent increase in their premiums.\nAnd the deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by one of those General Electric locomotives and you live for like a long time prior to death, you'll never, ever be able to use your healthcare—the healthcare. Because here's what's happened—here's what's happened. The deductible is so high, you never get to use it.\nSo, you're spending money, your deductibles raises by 17, 18, 19 percent. But now, it's going to go really bad, really bad. It's going to die of its own volition, but we have to kill it first. It's killing our country, it's killing our jobs—it's killing our jobs.\nSo, here's the story, folks—folks. We have to win Pennsylvania. We have to beat this professional group of people that are running her for her own—for their own purposes. We have to win Pennsylvania. We win Pennsylvania, we're going to win it. You know, we're up in Florida. We're doing well in Ohio. And I'm hearing we're doing well here. We'll find out.\nHere's the story... [applause]\nHere's the story. We have to win the state of Pennsylvania. I went to school here. My kids went to school here. We're going to win Pennsylvania.\nIf we win Pennsylvania, I'll tell you what. We are very much on our way. You know, the Republicans do have a tougher path, just so you—not my fault. Not my fault. It's a tougher path.\nFor the presidency, it's just a tougher, winding road. But if win Pennsylvania, we win Florida where we're doing really well, I think we can win Ohio, it'll be over. It'll be over. It'll be over. [applause]\nSo, on November 8th, you have to get out and vote or do some balloting, and I don't care—look, here's the story. If you're not feeling well, if you're so sick, if you go to your doctor and he goes, I'm sorry sir, but you've only got a few weeks left. And it's November 1st. And he gives you the ultimate word, not looking good. You haven't got long left. I don't care and nobody else in this room cares. You have to on November 8th get out of bed and get out and vote, right? Get out and vote. [applause]\nNow, in a lot of cases, you can do your early ballots too. All I'm telling you though—look, folks. I'm just saying your jobs have been taken. Your military and all of the other things, we're going to save your Second Amendment, which is protection, we're going to get of Common Core, you're going to bring your education locally. [applause]\nAll things—I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare. All these things. We're going to take care of our vets. But here's the story, folks. For you people in particular because you have been devastated.\nSupreme Court, he said. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Who did that? Who said that? Thank you.\nBy the way, and I have to just stop for a second. Look, Supreme Court Justice Scalia great. Was supposed to live for a long time. He died. So you have already an empty. This next president could have the most Supreme Court nominations of any president. Could take more justices than—it could be up to five. Probably going to be three, could be four, could be five. OK?\nIf Hillary Clinton gets to put hard-leaning left judges on the Supreme Court, number one, your Second Amendment will be gone. Our country will never ever be the same. We will have problems like we've never had before and you won't have—you will have a whole different deal going, which we don't want, believe me.\nSo, here's the story. If for no other reason, I am going to put—and you know, I've picked through Federalist society—we picked 11 Supreme Court justices. We're going to add probably four more, all vetted through Federalists, through Heritage, highly—I actually got very good marks. We're going to pick these people or people very like that.\nSo, here's the story, here's the story. You ready? We don't win anymore, you people don't win, that's for sure. You just have to look at the statistics for jobs. We're going to start winning again. We're going to win so much that you're going to get sick and tired of winning.\nYou're going to say Mr. President—you're going to send the congressman to see me in Washington. He's going to say, Mr. President, we have to do something. The people of Pennsylvania, and in particular our friends in Erie, they're sick and tired of winning. They can't stand winning so much. Mr. President, we just don't want to win that much. We really want to give other nations like it used to be, where it's good for them and bad for us, at least a little bit.\nAnd I'm going to say—I'm going to say, Mr. Congressman, I don't think you know your people very well, they want to win. And we want to win. And you want to win. And we're going to win. We're going to win so much. We're going to win with our military, we're going to knock the hell out of ISIS. [applause]\nWe're going to win for our vets. We're going to take of our vets. We're going to win at the border, we're going to build a wall, we're going to have Mexico pay, believe me 100 percent. We're going to win with education. We're going to win for our Second Amendment. We're going to win on all of the things we discussed. We're going to win again and you're going to be proud of your country again.\nWe're not going to be the people that are laughed at all over the world for not knowing what we're doing, for allowing others to come in and just strip us of what we have. [applause]\nWe are going to win. We are going to be America first. [applause]\nWe are going to make America great again. And it's going to happen quickly. [applause]\nThank you everybody, thank you.

One of the most urgent challenges of our time is climate change. We know that 2015 surpassed 2014 as the warmest year on record, and 2016 is on pace to be even hotter.\nWhen I took office, I said this was something we couldn't kick down the road any longer, that our children's future depended on our action. So we got to work, and over the past 7½ years, we've made ambitious investments in clean energy and ambitious reductions in our carbon emissions. We've multiplied wind power threefold. We've multiplied solar power more than thirtyfold. In parts of America, these clean power sources are finally cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. And carbon pollution from our energy sector is at its lowest level in 25 years, even as we're continuing to grow our economy.\nWe've invested in energy efficiency, and we're slashing carbon emissions from appliances, homes, and businesses, saving families money on their energy bills. We're reforming how we manage Federal coal resources, which supply roughly 40 percent of America's coal. We've set the first-ever national standards limiting the amount of carbon pollution power plants can release into the sky.\nWe also set standards to increase the distance our cars and light trucks can go on a gallon of gas every year through 2025. And they're working. At a time when we've seen auto sales surge, manufacturers are innovating and bringing new technology to market faster than expected. Over 100 cars, SUVs, and pickup trucks on the market today already meet our vehicles standards ahead of schedule. And we've seen a boom in the plug-in electric vehicle market, with more models, lower battery costs, and more than 16,000 charging stations.\nBut we're not done yet. In the weeks and months ahead, we'll release a second round of fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty vehicles. We'll take steps to meet the goal we set with Canada and Mexico to achieve 50 percent clean power across North America by 2025. And we'll continue to protect our lands and waters so that our kids and grandkids can enjoy our most beautiful spaces for generations.\nThere's still much more to do. But there's no doubt that America has become a global leader in the fight against climate change. Last year, that leadership helped us bring nearly 200 nations together in Paris around the most ambitious agreement in history to save the one planet we've got. That's not something to tear up, it's something to build upon. And if we keep pushing and leading the world in the right direction, there's no doubt that, together, we can leave a better, cleaner, safer future for our children.\nThanks, everybody.

That we are stronger together.\n\"Social Security benefits 59 million Americans today—but Republicans are relentlessly trying to attack and undermine this bedrock American guarantee. They want to cut benefits and gamble seniors' retirement security on the stock market through privatization.\n\"And Donald Trump is no different—just look who he chose as his running mate. Mike Pence spent his time in Congress championing efforts to dismantle Social Security—and to privatize it even faster than President George W.

Instead of cutting or privatizing Social Security, we will defend and expand it.\n\"When President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law, he said it 'represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but is by no means completed.' Social Security works, but we can make it better. Millions of women—and men—who are widowed or who take time out of the paid workforce to raise a child or care for a sick family member are being left behind. As President, I'll expand benefits to cover these hardworking Americans, because no one should have to live in poverty because their spouse died or they did the vital work of taking care of a loved one.\n\"Social Security isn't just a program—it's a promise.

He resolved to do everything he could to ease others' suffering and prevent other families from going through what he had.\n\"Since the launch of the Cancer Moonshot initiative, Vice President Biden has spurred unprecedented cooperation between federal agencies and leaders in the private and nonprofit sectors. Together, they are creating new protocols to promote the sharing of research data, pushing for more enrollment in clinical trials, and providing new tools for patients. And all of this effort is taking advantage of the incredible strides we have made in recent years to grapple with this disease. We know more than we ever have about the biology of cancer, how to prevent it, and how to treat it. We need to do more to build on these developments, advance our understanding, and develop more effective treatments. Simply put, if we make the right investments today, we can save lives.\n\"To start, Congress should fulfill the administration's request for moonshot funding next year. Cancer does not discriminate, and I believe leaders of both parties can come together to tackle this disease as part of a comprehensive effort to improve medical research across diseases, both by restoring robust funding to the National Institutes of Health, including the National Cancer Institute, and by harnessing the power of the private sector. And we will continue to build on Vice President Biden's work to mobilize the cancer community, make sure that scientists work together, and enable more patients to enroll in clinical trials. By combining new funding with creative approaches, we will not only catalyze progress against cancer: We will strengthen the nation's entire scientific enterprise.\n\"I could not be prouder to stand with Vice President Biden in this fight, and as President, I will take up the charge. My Administration will carry out the mission the Vice President has set, and continue to call on his advice, leadership, compassion, and sheer strength of will. Together, we will seize this moment.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "This speech was titled \"Understanding the Threat: Radical Islam and the Age of Terror\".", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119503", "text": "Thank you, everybody, thank you very much. It's great to be with you this afternoon and today we begin a conversation on how to make America safe again. In the twentieth century, the United States has defeated fascism, Nazism and communism. Now, a different threat faces our world: radical Islamic terrorism.\nThis summer, there's been an ISIS attack launched outside the warzones of the Middle East--hard to believe--every eighty-four hours. Here in America, we have seen one brutal attack after another: thirteen were murdered and thirty-eight wounded in the assault on Fort Hood. The Boston Marathon bombing wounded and maimed sixty-four people, and ultimately left five dead, including two of our great police officers . In Chattanooga, Tennessee, five unarmed Marines--unbelievable people, by the way--were shot and killed at a military recruiting center.\nLast September, fourteen innocent Americans were gunned down at an office party in San Bernardino; another twenty-two were very gravely injured. In June, forty-nine Americans were executed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando . Another fifty-three were badly injured. It was the worst mass shooting in our history, and the attack, by far, the worst on the LGBTQ community, and I'll tell you what: we can never, ever allow this to happen again. [applause]\nIn Europe--thank you--in Europe we have seen the same carnage and bloodshed afflicted upon our closest allies. In January of 2015, a French satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, was attacked for publishing cartoons of the prophet Mohammed. Twelve were killed, including two police officers, and 11 were wounded. Two days later, four were murdered in a Jewish delicatessen. In November of 2015 terrorist went on a shooting rampage in Paris that slaughtered 130 people, and wounded another 368 people, some in very, very, very bad shape today.\nFrance is suffering gravely. And the tourism industry is being massively affected in the most negative way. In March of this year terrorists detonated a bomb in Brussels airport killing 32 and injuring 340 people. This July in the South of France an Islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of mass murder, plowing down and killing 85 men, women and children and wounding 308 people.\nTerrible. Among the dead were two Americans, a Texas father and his 11-year-old son. A few weeks ago in Germany a refugee armed with an axe wounded 5 people in a gruesome train attack. Only days ago an ISIS killer invaded a Christian Church in Normandy, France forced an 85- year-old priest to his knees. A priest who was beloved, who was beloved; before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things.\nOverseas ISIS has carried out an absolute atrocity and one after another. Children slaughtered, girls sold into slavery, men and women burned alive, crucifixions, beheadings, and drownings, ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution. Holy sites desecrated. Christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination. ISIS rounding up what it calls 'Nation of the Cross', 'Nation of the Cross' in a campaign of absolute and total genocide.\nWe cannot let this evil continue. [applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nNor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam, it's oppression of women, gays, children and non-believers be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries. [applause] We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat we've faced at every age and before. But we will not, we will not, remember this, defeat it with closed eyes or silenced voices. We have a president that doesn't want to say the words.\nAnyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. [applause] Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president. [applause] The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton. Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama-Clinton administration took over.\nLibya was stable. Syria was under control. Egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the United States.\nIraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.\nFast forward to today. What we have--and think of this--and the decisions made by the Obama/Clinton group have been absolutely disastrous.\nLibya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other really brave Americans are dead. And ISIS has gained a new base of operations.\nSyria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.\nIn Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways of the world. Iraq is in chaos. And ISIS is on the loose. ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West.\nIn 2014, ISIS was operating in seven nations. They were in seven nations. Terrible, but that's what it was.\nToday they're fully operational in 18 countries with aspiring branches in six more for a total of 24. And many believe that number is actually 28 to 30 countries. They don't even know.\nThe situation is likely worse than the public has any idea. A new congressional report reveals that the Administration has downplayed the growth of ISIS with 40 percent of analysts saying they had experience efforts to manipulate their findings in trying to make it look much better than it is. It's bad.\nAt the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and to the United States. Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is not flush with $150 billion in cash released by the United States. Plus if you remember from two weeks ago, another $400 million in actual cash that was obviously used for ransom.\nWorst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East, and put the nation of Iran, which chants, \"death to America\", in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring a dominant world power.\nIt all began in 2009 with what has become known as President Obama's global apology tour. We all remember. We all remember. [Booing] In a series of speeches, President Obama described America as arrogant, dismissive, derisive, and a colonial power. He was describing us.\nHe informed other countries that he would be speaking up about America's past errors. He pledged that we would no longer be a senior partner that sought to dictate our terms. He lectured CIA officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes, and described Guantanamo Bay as a rallying cry for our enemies.\nPerhaps no speech was more misguided than President Obama's speech to the Muslim world, delivered in Cairo, Egypt, 2009. I remember it well.\nIn winning the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism and called the USSR the Evil Empire. Yet when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo, no such moral courage could be found or would be found. Instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations, and the systematic violations of human rights, or the financing of global terrorism, President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights record--and remember this, our human rights--and theirs.\nThe records are unbelievable and unmistakable.\nHis naive words were followed by even more naive actions. The failure to establish a new status of forces agreement in Iraq and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS without question. [applause]\nThe failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clinton's disaster, total disaster, in Libya. President Obama has since said that he regrets, and really regrets, Libya and the mistake he made. He considers it his worst mistake. According to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision, but Hillary Clinton's forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor. That's why we went in.\nWith one episode of bad judgment after another, Hillary Clinton's policies launched ISIS onto the world stage. Yet, as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out really to be not so hot for our world and our country. The Middle East in particular.\nThe Clintons made almost $60,000 in gross income while she was secretary of state. It is unbelievable. Incident after incident proves again and again Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment--as said by Bernie Sanders--stability and temperament and the moral character to lead our nation. [applause]\nImportantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face. Not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around. [applause]\nIt is now time for a new approach. Our current strategy of nation- building and regime-change is a proven, absolute failure. We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive. I was an opponent of the Iraq War from the beginning. A major difference between me and my opponent. Though I was a private citizen whose personal opinions on such matters were really not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion. I was against, believe me.\nThree months before the invasion I said in an interview with Neil Cavuto to whom I offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery, that \"perhaps we shouldn't be doing it yet. And that the economy is a much bigger problem.\"\nIn August of 2004, very early, right after the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire Magazine in an interview. Here's the quote in full. \"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess we're in. I would never have handled it that way.\" This was right after the invasion. \"Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country? C'mon.\"\nI then continued, \"Two minutes after we leave there's going to be a revolution and the meanest, toughest, smartest most viscous guy, in this case, guy, will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein did not have.\n\"What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention, in all fairness, the other side. The tremendous damage done. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All of this death and destruction for nothing.\"\nSo I've been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in. But I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out.\nAfter we had made those hard fought sacrifices and gains we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal on a timetable advertised to our enemies. They said, we're moving out, here's our time, here's our date. Who would do this but an incompetent president?\nAl Qaeda in Iraq had been decimated. And Obama and Clinton gave it new life and allowed it to spread all across the world. By that same token President Obama and Hillary Clinton should have never attempted to build a democracy in Libya, to push for immediate regime change in Syria or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt.\nOne more point on this. I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq. [applause] I said it over and over and over again. Another area where my judgment has been proven correct. I just said it so many times, virtually every time I was interviewed, keep the oil, keep the oil.\nAccording to CNN, ISIS made as much as $500,000 in oil sales in 2014 alone. That's before they really got started. Fueling and funding its reign of terror. If we had controlled the oil like I said we should, we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq, both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of U.S. forces necessary to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for us to have the oil.\nI was saying this constantly and consistently to whomever would listen. I said, \"Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Don't let somebody else get it.\" [applause] If they had listened to me then we would have had the economic benefits of the oil which I wanted to use to help take care of the wounded soldiers and families of those who died in the war. [applause] In addition to which thousands of lives would have been saved. This proposal by its very nature would have left soldiers in place of our assets. We would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil. In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils. [applause] Instead, all we got from Iraq and our ventures in the Middle East, was death, destruction and tremendous financial loss. But it's time to put the mistakes of the past behind us and chart a new course. [applause]\nIf I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end. [applause] Thank you. Our new approach--which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas and by our friends in the Middle East--must be to halt the spread of radical Islam. All actions should be oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will be our ally. Very important. Some don't share this goal. We cannot always choose our friends but we can never fail to recognize our enemies. [applause]\nAs president, I will call for an international conference focused on this goal. We will work side by side with our friends in the Middle East, including our greatest ally Israel. [applause] We will partner with King Abdullah of Jordan and the president of Egypt, President Sisi, and all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished. [applause]\nWe will also work very closely with NATO on this new mission. I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats. Very good. Very, very good.\nI also believe that we could find common ground with Russia in a fight against ISIS. Wouldn't that be a good thing? Wouldn't that be a good thing? [applause] They, too, have much at stake in the outcome in Syria, and have had their own battles with Islamic terrorism just as bad as ours. They have a big, big problem in Russia with ISIS.\nMy administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS. International cooperation to cut off their funding. Expanded intelligence sharing, and cyber warfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting. Their recruiting is taking place right now, and they're setting records. It's got to be stopped. [applause]\nWe cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool and for other purposes by our enemy. We must shut down their access to this form of communication, and we must do it immediately--immediately. [applause]\nUnlike Hilary Clinton, who has risked so many lives with her careless of handling of sensitive information, my administration will not telegram exactly military plans and what they are. [applause] And by the way, what's happened with her 33,000 e-mails is an absolute disgrace to the United States of America. [applause]\nI've often said that the great General Douglas MacArthur and the great General George Patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to recklessly announce their every move before it happens. Like they did in Iraq, so that the enemy can prepare and adapt. Their enemy says, \"Thank you.\"\nThe fight will not be limited to ISIS. We will decimate Al- Qaeda. And we will seek to starve funding for Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah. [applause] So important. We can use existing U.N. Security Council resolutions to apply new and even stronger sanctions. Military, cyber and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle Islamic terrorism.\nBut we must use ideological warfare as well. Very important. And they use it on us, better than we have ever even thought of using it on them. But that will change.\nJust as we won, just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets, so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam. While my opponent accepted millions of dollars in foundation donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by prison or death, my administration will speak out against the oppression of women, gays and people of different beliefs. [applause]\nOur administration would be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East and will amplify their voices. This includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings, where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings. Over 1,000 Pakistani girls are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year.\nRecently a prominent Pakistani social media star was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family. In his confession, the brother took pride in the murder and said, \"Girls are born to stay home and follow traditions.\" Shockingly, this is a tradition that has reached our own shores. One such case, and many, many cases have happened--where one involves an Iraqi immigrant who was sentenced to 34 years in jail for running over his own daughter, claiming she had been \"too Westernized.\"\nTo defeat Islamic terrorism we must also speak our forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow. It's a breeding ground. It's a terrible, terrible breeding ground.\nA new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well. [applause] The common thread linking the major Islamic terror attacks that have recently occurred on our soil--9/11, the Fort Hood shooting, the Boston bombing, the San Bernardino attack, the Orlando attack--is that they have involved immigrants or the children of immigrants.\nClearly, new screening procedures are needed. A review by the U.S. Senate Immigration Subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses between 9/11 and 2014, and many more since then, and this year is a record for identification. It's gotten worse, far worse.\nWe also know that ISIS recruits refugees after their entrance into the country, as we have seen with the Somali refugee population in Minnesota.\nBeyond terrorism, as we have also seen in France, foreign populations have brought their anti-Semitic attitudes with them. In Cologne, Germany on New Years, we have seen the reports of sexual violence and assault far greater than anybody knows.\nPew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large number of immigrants--extreme views about religion such death penalty--and for those who are involved--the death penalty is very, very common if you don't have the faith that they demand you have.\nA Trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration, and we will be tough, and we will be even extreme. [applause] We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme--extreme vetting.\nOur country has enough problems. We don't need more, and these are problems like we've never had before. [applause]] In addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers we must also screen out any with hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles, or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law. [applause] Those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry or hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country. [applause] Only those who we expect to flourish in our country, and to embrace a tolerant American society should be issued visas. [applause] To put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world, that have a history of exporting terrorism, nor for us! Not for us. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you. As soon as I take office, I will ask the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to identify a list of regions where adequate screening cannot take place, there are many such regions. We will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume, based on new circumstances or new procedures. The size of current immigration flows are simply too large to perform adequate screening. [applause] We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year . Beyond that, we admit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions--hundreds of thousands . If we don't control the numbers, we can't perform adequate screening. There's no way it can take place. [applause]\nBy contrast, my opponent wants to increase--which is unbelievable, no matter who you are, where you come from--wants to increase the flow of Syrian refugees by 550% over what they are now. [Boos] The United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillary's plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term , assuming no cuts to other refugee programs--so it could get worse! This would be additional to all other non-refugee immigration. Unbelievable numbers. Unbelievable numbers. The Subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the cost of healthcare, welfare, housing, schooling and other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Department's placement figures. Think of this: $400 billion. In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel. [Boos] And you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany. Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe. We have enough problems in our country. We don't need more.\nLastly, we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures. Another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored. The 9/11 hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications. Almost every one of them. It said practically in big bold letters \"fraud\". And nobody saw it. The Russians warned us about the Boston bombers, here on political asylum, and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the FBI. Very sad.\nThe female San Bernardino shooter, on her--on her statements, and everything that she said: she was here on a fiancйe visa, which most people have not even heard of, from Saudi Arabia, and she wanted to support very openly jihad online. These are the people we're taking in.\nA neighbor saw suspicious behavior--bombs on the floor, and other things--but didn't warn authorities because they said they didn't want to be accused of racial profiling. Now, many are dead and many more are gravely wounded.\nThe shooter in Orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after 9/11 . He, too, was interviewed by the FBI. His father, a native of Afghanistan, supported the oppressive Taliban regime, and expressed anti-American views very strongly , and by the way, was just seen sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big fat smile on his face, all the way through her speech. [Boos] He obviously liked what she had to say. It's called: weakness, weakness. It's called stupidity, and we've had it. [applause]\nThe Fort Hood shooter delivered a presentation to a room full of mental health experts before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another. He even proclaimed that we \"love death more then you love life\". Not good. These warning signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense in our society. [applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nThat is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a commission on radical Islam, which will include reformers voices in the Muslim community, who will hopefully work with us. We want to build bridges and erase divisions. The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization. This commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers, federal investigators and immigration screeners. And while I'm at it, we should give a hand to our great police officers and law enforcement officials. [applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nWe will also keep open Guantanamo Bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence. Drone strikes will remain part of our strategy, but we will also seek to capture high-value targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations. [applause] Foreign combatants will be tried in military commissions. [applause]\nFinally, we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends materiel support to terrorism. There will be consequences for those people. There will be very serious consequences. [applause] Similar to the effort to take down the mafia, this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country. [applause] To accomplish a goal, you must state a mission. The support networks for radical Islam in this country will be stripped out and removed, one-by-one, viciously if necessary--viciously if necessary. Immigration offices will also have their powers restored. Those have been taken away. Those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home immediately and if they don't immediately, we will return them home.\nTo make America safe again, we must work together again. Our victory in the Cold War relied on a bipartisan and international consensus. That is what we must have to defeat radical Islamic terrorism. [applause]\nBut just like we couldn't defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists, or explaining its horrible evils, we can't defeat radical Islamic terrorism unless we do the exact same thing. We have to explain that it exists, and explain the difficulties. We have to have a leader that can do that, and we do not have that now.\nBut this also means that we have to promote the exceptional virtues of our own way of life. We have an exceptional country, an exceptional way of life. But it's being tread on by sick, sick people. And expecting that as newcomers come into our society, they will likewise have respect and do the same. Pride in our institutions, our history and our values should be taught by parents and teachers and impressed upon all of those that come into our society and want to join our society. [applause]\nAssimilation is not an act of hostility, but an expression of compassion. Our system of government and our American culture is the best in the world, and we'll produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it. [applause] Thank you. Thank you.\nThis approach will not only make us safer, but bring us closer together as a country. Renewing the spirit of Americanism will help heal the divisions in our country, of which there are so many. We have a divider as president. We call him the Great Divider. It's the thing he best. [applause] It will do so by emphasizing what we have in common, not what pulls us apart.\nThis is my pledge to the American People: as your president, I will be your single greatest champion. I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. [applause] We will reject bigotry and hatred, and oppression, in all of its ugly forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American People. Only this way will we make America great again, and safe again--for everyone. Thank you very much, God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

In his remarks, he referred to Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Presidential nominee Donald J. Trump. Audio was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118830", "text": "Well, with an introduction like that I should just stop now. [Laughter] Carol, thank you so much, and Hank and to the entire Goldberg clan. There are all these gorgeous Goldberg kids running around somewhere. And what a wonderful time to be here.\nI see some really wonderful old friends who have been with us through the incredible journey, and I see some new friends. I do remember that event at Eli Segal's. And Eli was such a great American and had provided such great service to the country, and obviously, he's missed. But in some ways, his spirit lives on through all of us. A lot of the work that we've pursued during the course of this administration reflects the values that he worked on so valiantly for so many years.\nI'm here because we've got an election. And although Michelle is very strict about me actually taking a vacation when I get a vacation, she gave me a special dispensation for this evening because she understands, just as all of you understand, how important this is.\nIt's important because we have made extraordinary progress over the last 8 years on a whole range of issues. The economy, which was on the verge of collapse when I came into office, is, by almost every measure, better than it was 8 years ago. Unemployment has been slashed by more than half. Incomes are up. Wages have begun to go up. We have seen 20 million people get health insurance that didn't have it before. We have doubled our production of clean energy. We are as close to energy-independent as we've ever been. We are seeing record graduation rates in high school, and college enrollment rates.\nThere's a lot of good news out there. And I could not be prouder of the part that our administration played in helping the American people rebound from what was an extraordinarily difficult time. But what is also true is we've still got a lot of work to do. Our job is not finished. There are still too many people out there who, if they have a job, don't make enough money to get beyond the worries of paying their bills at the end of the month. There are still people who don't have health insurance, not because we haven't tried, but because you have Governors who have been resistant or a Congress that has not wanted to work with us to close those final gaps in coverage that are so necessary.\nDespite the extraordinary work that we've done in mobilizing 200 nations to, for the first time, tackle climate change in a comprehensive, aggressive way, we've still got a long way to go before we're out of the woods on that one. And that is a genuine existential threat that we all face and, more importantly, our children and our grandchildren face.\nWe still have too much violence in our society. There are still conflicts not just in the Middle East, but around the world. And given the rapidity of change, the pace of change that's taken place, it is absolutely critical that we have a capable, visionary, hard-working, diligent, smart, tenacious leader in the Oval Office. And that's Hillary Clinton. That's who she is.\nNow, a lot of you were at the convention in Philadelphia, and so you heard me and Joe Biden and Michelle and others make the case, and you heard Hillary make the case herself. I'm not going to belabor it. I want to spend most of my time with questions. The main thing I want to emphasize is that this is somebody who I know and I have worked alongside for many years. And look, I'm a Democrat, and so it's fair to say that whoever the Democratic nominee was I would want to get behind them. But I don't display the kinds of enthusiasm and energy and commitment to Hillary's candidacy just because of the fact that we belong to the same political party.\nWhen I say that she knows what she's talking about, it's because I have seen her do the work. When I talk about her work ethic, it's because I've watched her travel around the world and, at a breathless pace, manage a whole range of conflicts and open up opportunities that have resulted in American national security interests being served. When I tell you that I've seen how she works not just with me, but with her staff and people below her in a way that is full of integrity and seriousness and good humor, it's something that I've witnessed on a day-to-day basis.\nAnd as I said at the convention, you don't know ahead of time how you're going to turn out as President. You don't—you figure, \"I seem to know what I'm talking about\"—[laughter]—\"I think I have a good sense of what's involved.\" But until you sit at that desk and you're making life-and-death decisions and you're deploying young men and women to war, or you're having to avert a crisis that can affect millions or, in some cases, billions of lives, you don't know how you're going to respond.\nBut I will tell you that I have as good a guess when it comes to how Hillary will respond as I would of anybody's, because I've seen her under really tough-pressure situations. And that's what's needed right now.\nWhat I also know is the passion that she feels for making sure that ordinary people in this country get a hand up, get a break, that somebody's fighting for them. Now, she's not always the flashiest. She's not always the person who's going to give you the big stemwinder. But she is the person who's going to do the work. And whether it's her advocacy for children, or her advocacy for health care, or her advocacy on behalf of equal pay or making sure that we've got childcare for families that need it, she hasn't just talked the talk, she's walked the walk for decades. And my grandmother used to tell me, you want to judge how somebody is going to do, look at what they've done. [Laughter] And she's done the work.\nSo look, I know this is not an audience where I need to make a hard sell. [Laughter] To some degree, I had you at hello—[laughter]—when it comes to voting for Hillary. What I do want to emphasize is needing a sense of urgency and finishing the job of getting her elected. And you notice I haven't said much about her opponent. [Laughter] Frankly, I'm tired of talking about her opponent. I don't have to make the case against her opponent because every time he talks he makes the case against his own candidacy.\nBut what I do know is that this has been an unpredictable election season, but—not only because of anxieties and concerns that the American people have, but also because of the changing nature of the media and voting patterns. There's still a lot of uncertainty out there. And if we are not running scared until the day after the election, we are going to be making a grave mistake.\nAnd Democrats are interesting creatures. We tend to veer from full-fledged freakout and \"the world is ending and everything is terrible,\" which—I had conversations with some of you about 3 months ago, and it was \"the world was ending\"—[laughter]—to \"it's going to be fine\" and \"who do you think she's going to appoint for Commerce Secretary?\" [Laughter] And what I'd like us to do is veer somewhere in between those two extremes. [Laughter] If we do our job, then Hillary will be elected President of the United States. But if we do not do our jobs, then it's still possible for her to lose. And when I say \"do our jobs,\" what I mean is we are going to have to continue to be engaged. We are going to continue to have to write checks. We are going to continue to have to make phone calls and rally people behind her candidacy. We are still going to have to fight what has been a unrelenting negative campaign against her that has made a dent in the opinion of people even who are inclined to vote for her.\nSo we've got to be aggressive in our campaigning for 80 days. And that's not a lot. But when you think about the stakes, there's nothing more important. This is a group that has been extraordinarily fortunate. By definition, if you are here, you've had a blessed life, and your kids have been bequeathed and your grandchildren have been bequeathed extraordinary good fortune. But as fortunate as you are, if we have a society of growing inequality, if we have a world where oceans are rising and droughts and famines are common occurrences, and millions of people are being displaced, and refugees are trying to find refuge someplace and crossing oceans and dying because they have no choice, all of us will be poorer for it. This will not be the kind of world that we want for our kids and our grandkids.\nAnd to invest 80 days to make sure that we at least have a leader in the White House who understands that—not because they're going to be perfect, not because Hillary is going to solve every problem, just like I wasn't perfect and I wasn't able to solve every problem—but at least somebody who understands what's required and every single day is waking up and making best efforts to do it, if we're not willing to invest 80 days to make sure that happens, then shame on us.\nSo we've got to work. And I don't want to hear it about whether \"I'm not sufficiently inspired\" or \"we've got this in the bag\" or \"I've got other things to do.\" You've got to work for 80 days. And I'm glad to see some young people here. I hope you volunteer and get involved in the campaign and do your part. And if you do, then I continue to be, as I said in Philadelphia, extraordinarily optimistic about this greatest Nation on Earth and the prospects for our future.\nThank you very much, everybody.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119165", "text": "It's so great to be here tonight. I am honored to also be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker, Chairman Reince Priebus, and Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\nWe are at a decisive moment in this election.\nLast week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country. Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism. Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness.\nLet me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.\nThe violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.\nLaw and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.\nThe main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods. It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result.\nThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.\nThe narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one. The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.\nMore law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.\nJust like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police. You know it, and I know it.\nThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society – a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent – share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.\nThey have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.\nEverytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives – whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore – and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.\nDuring the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded. More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama's hometown area since his presidency began.\nHow are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers?\nThe war on our police must end. It must end now.\nThe war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety.\nOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor. Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus. Or the young child walking home from school.\nFor every one violent protestor, there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night. My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.\nHillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities.\nI care too much about my country to let that happen.\nWe all care too much about our country to let that happen.\nGood policing saves lives. My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this. The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.\nImagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn't blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City? I'll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country.\nIt's easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force. I believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security.\nHillary Clinton has had her chance. She failed. Now it's time for new leadership.\nThe Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most.\nThere is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people. It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American – and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time.\nI am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.\nIt is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.\nThe Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.\nLet us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade. Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings. 18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims. The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average. Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job. Nearly four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty. 55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil. There is only a 60% graduation rate, and it's one of the worst public school systems in the country.\n1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit.\nTo every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future.\nThe Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted. They've just assumed they'll get your support and done nothing in return for it. It's time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it's time to rebuild the inner cities of America – and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.\nI'm not part of the corrupt system. In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me. I've been paying my own way. The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system.\nThe other party – the Democratic Party – nominated the personification of special interest corruption. The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.\nI am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help. The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.\nJobs. Safety. Opportunity. Fair and equal representation.\nWe reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future. She doesn't care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.\nThe African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party. It's time to break with the failures of the past – I want to offer Americans a new future.\nIt is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests.\nEvery insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton. The hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class.\nIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.\nInsiders fighting for insiders.\nI am fighting for you.\nWhen we talk about the insider, who are we talking about? It's the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests. It's the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill. It's the financial industry that knows how to regulate their competition out of existence. The insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change.\nEvery day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and you hear about some self-interest banker or some discredited Washington insider says they oppose our campaign. Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign. Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.\nI wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change. I am fighting – all of us across the country are fighting – for peaceful regime change in our own country. The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\nThe leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country.\nI am going to give the people their voice back.\nThink about it. The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result.\nThe people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another.\nThe people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another.\nAren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?\nAren't you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?\nAre you ready for change?\nAre you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first? That puts your country first? That puts your family first?\nLet's talk about what this means for the inner cities of America. It's time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests. I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system – a lot of people who've created our problems – will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign.\nIt's time to stop making the special interests rich. It's time to make the American people rich.\nI am going to Make America Wealthy again.\nThe Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin.\nThey've ruined the schools.\nThey've driven out the jobs.\nThey've tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.\nViolent crime has risen 17% in America's 50 largest cities last year. Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent. Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore. They are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C.\nThis is the future offered by Hillary Clinton. More poverty, more crime, and more of the same. The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine.\nIt is time for a different future.\nHere is what I am proposing.\nFirst, on immigration. No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton's immigration policies than the African-American community. Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans. I will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community. We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people.\nOn trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job.\nOn taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores – and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave.\nI am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee. Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas. I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States.\nOn education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers. We are going to put students and parents first.\nHillary Clinton would rather deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy.\nI am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.\nOn crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods. To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end.\nOn healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare – which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases – and give choice to patients and consumers. Aetna, just today, announced they are dropping out – as are many of the major insurance companies.\nOn government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government. We've seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense. We've seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government.\nIn my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.\nI am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.\nI am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government. This is all just the beginning.\nWe are going to make this a government of the people once again. This is our chance to take back power from all the people who've taken it from you. The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.\nThese are tough times. But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before.\nTo do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House.\nI will be your fighter.\nTo defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina. Hillary Clinton doesn't have that strength and stamina. She cannot win for you.\nMost importantly, she has bad judgment. Bad judgment on terrorism, bad judgement on foreign policy, bad judgment on trade.\nThe only individuals she's ever delivered for is her donors – not the people.\nI've said it before, and I'll say it again. My opponent asks her supporters to repeat a three-word pledge. Her pledge reads: \"I'm With Her\"\nI choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: \"I'm With You – the American people.\"\nI will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity – a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. We will once again be a country of law and order, and a country of great success.\nTo every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\nTogether, We will make America strong again.\nWe will make American safe again.\nAnd we will make America great again.\nThank you, and God Bless.", "timestamp": "2016-08-16", "title": "Remarks at the Washington County Fair Park in West Bend, Wisconsin"}

The pledge represents a call-to-action for all members of the private sector to improve their communities by eliminating barriers for those with a criminal record and creating a pathway for a second chance.\nToday we're announcing a round of new signatories, bringing the total number of pledged employers to 185. The new commitments are from a diverse range of employers including: Walmart, Dropbox, and the University of Pennsylvania. The companies and organizations that have signed the pledge collectively employ over 3 million Americans.\nSince the President took office, this Administration has been committed to reforming America's criminal justice system and highlighting the importance of reducing barriers facing justice-involved individuals who are trying to put their lives back on track. Over 2.2 million individuals are incarcerated in American prisons and jails, and the vast majority of them will return to their communities. Improving education and job opportunities for these individuals has a recognized effect of reducing crime and will make our communities safer.\nBy signing the Fair Chance Business Pledge, these companies are:\n•      Voicing strong support for economic opportunity for all, including the approximately 70 million Americans who have some form of a criminal record.\n•      Demonstrating an ongoing commitment to take action to reduce barriers to a fair shot at a second chance, including practices such as \"banning the box\" by delaying criminal history questions until later in the hiring process; ensuring that information regarding an applicant's criminal record is considered in proper context; and engaging in hiring practices that do not unnecessarily place jobs out of reach for those with criminal records.\n•      Today's announcement is further evidence of the private sector's support for a more fair justice system. Throughout the year, the Administration will continue to highlight businesses that join the Fair Chance Business Pledge.\nTHE FAIR CHANCE BUSINESS PLEDGE\nWe applaud the growing number of public and private sector organizations nationwide who are taking action to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed, including individuals who have had contact with the criminal justice system. When around 70 million Americans – nearly one in three adults – have a criminal record, it is important to remove unnecessary barriers that may prevent these individuals from gaining access to employment, training, education and other basic tools required for success in life. We are committed to providing individuals with criminal records, including formerly incarcerated individuals, a fair chance to participate in the American economy.\nCompanies and organizations interested in joining the Fair Chance Business Pledge can do so by signing up HERE.\nToday's signatories include:\n•      3D PARS\n•      Aesthetics On The Glow\n•      ALB3 Consulting Research & Management\n•      Anzures Worldwide\n•      Aone Contracting & Supply\n•      Asian Media Access\n•      Associated Students Inc., San Francisco State University - Project Rebound\n•      Bob Barker Company\n•      Bubbles Bubbles Bubbles, LLC\n•      C.H.

Originally launched in 2011, the Federal Interagency Reentry Council brings together representatives from more than 20 agencies across the federal government to expand the range of tools available so that every individual returning from prison or jail has a meaningful chance to rebuild their life and reclaim their future. Co-Chaired by the Attorney General and the Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, the Federal Interagency Reentry Council coordinates and leverages existing federal resources, dispels myths related to reentry and clarifies policies, elevates promising practices, and reduces the policy barriers to successful reentry.\nNational Reentry Week\nThe Department of Justice also released an after-action report today describing the success of this year's first-ever National Reentry Week. Held during the week of April 24th, this inaugural effort featured more than 550 events throughout the country, as well as several federal, state, and local actions and announcements aimed at improving reentry outcomes and raising awareness of the importance of successful rehabilitation and reintegration into communities. As the after-action report notes, leaders from across the Administration traveled in support of these events, which included:\n•      More than 75 resource fairs, connecting individuals with housing, legal aid, community-based reentry services and other vital resources;\n•      More than 65 employment-related events, providing recently released individuals with opportunities to connect with employers and job search resources;\n•      More than 75 reentry presentations, informing individuals returning home from prison or jail about ways to succeed despite the barriers they may face as they reenter their communities;\n•      More than 35 family-related events, providing individuals with information that will assist them with their release;\n•      More than 30 stakeholder meetings, bringing together all parties that have a stake in the reentry process;\n•      More than 25 graduation ceremonies, marking successful completion of programs ranging from reentry court programs to GED and vocational training curricula; and\n•      More than 25 reentry simulations, highlighting real-life issues facing reentering individuals.\nThese announcements build on the Administration's longstanding commitment to improving reentry outcomes and removing unnecessary obstacles facing formerly incarcerated individuals, including:\n•      Establishing the Federal Interagency Reentry Council to lead the Government's work on the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals returning to their communities from prisons and jails.\n•      Proposing a rule \"Banning the Box\" in federal employment by prohibiting federal agencies from asking questions about criminal and credit history of applicants for tens of thousands of government jobs until a conditional offer of employment has been made.\n•      Releasing guidance on the application of Fair Housing Act standards on the use of criminal records by providers of housing and providing guidance for public housing authorities on excluding the use of arrest records in housing decisions.\n•      Clarifying that individuals in state or local halfway houses and those on probation or parole are not excluded from Medicaid and describing how states can better facilitate access to Medicaid services for individuals reentering the community.\n•      Making available Veterans Affairs services and support to justice-involved veterans in over 350 Veterans Treatment Courts and other Veteran-focused court programs and 1,284 local jails.\n•      Removing unnecessary barriers to college access. The Department of Education issued Beyond the Box Guidance and higher education institutions from across the country joined the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge to voice their support for the reforms needed to expand college opportunity.\n•      Establishing the My Brother's Keeper Task Force in February of 2014, which is charged with addressing persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color and ensuring all young people can reach their full potential. Many of the announcements being made today respond to the Task Force's May 2014 Report to the President, which included a wide range of recommendations designed to create clear pathways to opportunity and \"eliminate unnecessary barriers to giving justice-involved youth a second chance.\"\n•      In addition, in 2012, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission released updated guidance on the appropriate use of arrest and conviction records in employment decisions and clarified employers' nondiscrimination obligations.", "timestamp": "2016-08-16", "title": "Fact Sheet: White House Announces New Commitments to the Fair Chance Business Pledge"}

The United States has been a firm and consistent supporter of Serbia's efforts to strengthen its relationship with NATO. We value, in particular, Serbia's commitment to multilateral efforts aimed at defeating ISIL and combating international terrorism. Our Ohio National Guard led bilateral State Partnership Program, which we launched in 2006, is the cornerstone of our security relationship and has provided an effective platform for developing vibrant and close ties between our armed forces. In a similar vein, the United States and Serbia have partnered for more than nine years through our International Military Education and Training (IMET) program to allow Serbian and American officers and non-commissioned officers to train together and learn from each other in our most prestigious military schools.\nThe United States deeply appreciates and continues to support Serbia's contributions to global peacekeeping efforts, and in August 2016 we delivered 19 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs/Humvees) to Serbia to support Serbian units participating in UN operations across the globe. This brings to 40 the total number of Humvees delivered under our Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, which has provided more than $8.6 million in security assistance to Serbia for defense modernization and training since 2011. Serbia has been a Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) partner since 2011, benefiting from an additional $9.7 million in U.S. security assistance aimed at enhancing Belgrade's capability to train and deploy peacekeeping forces. Since becoming a proactive GPOI partner, Serbia has increased by more than 10 times its contributions to UN Peacekeeping Operations. Finally, in July, Serbia helped the United States advance a key foreign policy and humanitarian objective by agreeing to resettle two former detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention facilities.\nPartners in Development\nAmerica has long been committed to economic and democratic development in Serbia and the wider Balkan region. From 2001 - 2015, the United States invested more than $728 million to stimulate economic growth, strengthen the justice system, and promote good governance in Serbia. Projects include partnering directly with the Government of Serbia to strengthen private sector firms in 12 municipalities in the economically disadvantaged regions of south and southwest Serbia, and working to create jobs and stimulate small business through support for the Opportunity Bank of Serbia, which provides small loans to clients that cannot ordinarily access financial services from traditional banks. A public-private partnership provides vocational training to women to improve the quality of their skills to meet the needs of industry in Serbia's Srem district.\nOur good governance assistance programs collaborate with civil society organizations and government agencies to improve the implementation of Serbia's new whistleblower protection law. Democracy Commission grants support freedom of information and anti-corruption public awareness campaigns and advocacy initiatives, while the Women's Leadership Academy is supporting female leaders in an effort to increase the ratio of women in local governments and to push for an agenda on gender equality in the policy processes. In addition, we are developing media assistance programs that will support the independence of media regulatory bodies and civil society media watchdogs, improve the public's ability to analyze media content, and enhance the capabilities of independent media outlets to produce and distribute investigative and quality news content.\nIn partnership with Serbia's government and judiciary, we are strengthening Serbia's rule of law by helping to improve the transparency, efficiency, and professionalism of the justice system. Our assistance to key independent agencies is strengthening their capacity and enhancing public accountability. We are providing support to civil society to more effectively engage with government and represent the public interest.\nSince the end of the Balkan conflicts of the 1990's the United States Government has provided over $900 million in the region to provide durable solutions for refugees and displaced persons, including returns, local integration, and the provision of humanitarian assistance to alleviate suffering and support self-sufficiency. In Serbia, this funding has assisted more than 50,000 displaced and refugee families who fled to Serbia during the Balkan wars and Kosovo conflict with housing, legal aid, income generation, and other support. In addition, since 2015, the United States has responded to the wider European migration crisis with more than $67 million to support United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees efforts to provide protection and humanitarian assistance for the more than one million migrants and refugees who have traveled through Serbia on the Western Balkan route. In addition, through the Complex Crisis Fund (CCF), America provided $2 million to mitigate the impact of migrants on local communities and improve the response coordination between government and civil society service providers.\nPartners in Business\nSince 2001, U.S. businesses have invested some $3.8 billion in Serbia, creating or protecting over 16,000 Serbian jobs. Key American investors include KKR, Ball Packaging, Cooper Tires, and Coca-Cola. Serbia is also home to an active American Chamber of Commerce, with 195 members representing every sector of the Serbian economy. American businesses also have active Corporate Social Responsibility programs, giving back and developing the communities in which they work. Companies such as Eaton, Apatinska Brewery, and Actavis have contributed to their communities through public service campaigns, educational and environmental initiatives, and donations of medicine.\nPartners in Justice\nSince 2003, the United States has partnered with Serbia to improve its rule of law, fight against corruption, and modernize its law enforcement institutions. Targeted assistance to Serbia's judiciary, the High Court Council, and the Judicial Academy fosters professionalization of judges and staff, enhances accountability and independence, and modernizes practices. The United States funds and oversees several programs that work closely with Serbian prosecutors, judges and law enforcement, providing support in legislative and structural reform, training, regional cooperation, and technical assistance. The United States has spent $40 million on these programs in order to provide expert advice through resident legal advisors, implement professional training programs, and provide equipment donations. All of these activities are aimed at improving Serbia's judiciary, prosecution service, and law-enforcement agencies so that they can better tackle complex and transnational crime including corruption, fraud, organized crime, and terrorism. These efforts have been critical in the development of a witness security unit, war crimes investigative service, and the Operational Analysis Network, which facilitates intelligence-led criminal investigations.\nOur resident legal advisors have also helped the Serbian government to conclude important reforms to the legal framework, including Serbia's prosecutor-led Criminal Procedure Code, the Law on the Protection of Whistleblowers, and the Law on Police. United States support to Serbia's Judicial Academy has built capacity important to their European Union accession process. In February, Serbia adopted a ground-breaking Holocaust-era heirless property restitution law, one of the first of its kind in Europe, which provides for the restitution of heirless and unclaimed Jewish property expropriated during the Holocaust.\nPartners in Education and Culture\nThe strongest ties between the United States and Serbia continue to be our people-to-people ties. More than 20,000 Serbians visit the United States every year, and nearly 1,000 Serbian students attend U.S. universities. The United States continues to support a robust program of cultural and educational exchange with Serbia, with more than 3,500 participants last year. Every year, our FLEX program brings forty high school students from Serbia to the United States to live with host families and attend U.S. schools for an entire academic year. Our Fulbright program has been active since 2001 and has fostered academic exchanges and collaborative research across a number of fields, including law, economics, information technology, and medicine. Our American Corners in Belgrade, Bujanovac, Kragujevac, Nis, Novi Pazar, Novi Sad, Subotica, and Vranje provide opportunities for Serbians to study English and to learn about U.S. culture and educational opportunities. They also provide platforms for engagement between visiting U.S. speakers and performers and Serbian citizens of all ages. Our International Visitor Leadership Program has provided up-and-coming Serbian leaders with opportunities to explore the American experience in their chosen fields, and to build lasting friendships with American counterparts.", "timestamp": "2016-08-16", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S.-Serbia Relations: Progress through Partnership"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122663", "text": "Heavy duty vehicles account for more than 20 percent of carbon pollution from transportation and without additional action, the amount of emissions is expected to grow. That is why, in the first term, President Obama worked with the trucking industry to put in place the first-ever national policy to increase fuel economy and decrease carbon pollution for Model Years 2014 – 2018 medium- and heavy duty vehicles, while making historic investments to boost innovation in new technologies.\nToday, we are taking the next step and finalizing common sense rules that will improve fuel economy and ensure that America sets the global standard for innovative medium- and heavy- duty vehicles for the next decade. To continue to accelerate the development of innovative technologies, we are also announcing $140 million in new investments for the next generation of fuel efficient trucks and other vehicles. These actions will give our trucks and manufacturers a competitive edge and, over the lifetime of the vehicles sold through the program, will reduce approximately 1.1 billion tons of carbon emissions that harm our environment and our health. This reduction is the equivalent of taking nearly all the cars in the United States off the road for a year. And by lowering fuel costs and reducing shipping costs, these actions will help Americans save money on the products we buy.\nFINALIZING STANDARDS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND IMPROVE FUEL EFFICIENCY OF MEDIUM- AND HEAVY-DUTY VEHICLES FOR MODEL YEAR 2018 AND BEYOND\nToday,  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) will jointly adopt a second round of standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles that willcut carbon pollution and improve fuel efficiency, while bolstering energy security and spurring manufacturing innovation. These ambitious and achievable standards, which represent a strengthening of the first standards, will promote a new generation of cleaner, more fuel efficient trucks by encouraging the wider application of currently available technologies and the development and deployment of new and advanced cost-effective technologies through Model Year 2027. When fully implemented, the standards will cut approximately 1.1 billion tons of carbon pollution, save vehicle owners nearly $170 billion in fuel costs, and reduce oil consumption by up to 84 billion gallons.\nThe program, which EPA and DOT worked closely with the California Air Resource Board to finalize, includes carbon and fuel efficiency standards for certain trailers used with heavy-duty combination tractors for the first time; creates certainty by creating standards that increase over a period of 10 years; allows manufacturers to achieve the standards through a mix of different technologies; yields fuel savings that more than offset the costs and have favorable payback periods for truck owners; encourages manufacturers to continue to build a single fleet of vehicles and engines for the entire U.S. market; establishes complete vehicle standards and enhanced test procedures that incentivize holistic technology approaches for further real world improvements; and improves the agencies' ability to measure industry's performance and enforce compliance drawing from extensive data and stakeholder feedback related to actual vehicle performance. Additionally, based on input and technical data received during the public comment period, the final program achieves 10 percent more carbon emission and fuel consumption reductions than the proposed standards. The program achieves these benefits through:\n•      Requiring up to 25 percent lower carbon emissions and fuel consumption for tractors used in combination tractor-trailer vehicles, delivery trucks, school buses, and other vocational vehicles, compared to the Administration's first round of standards for Model Years 2014 - 2018;\n•      Locking in standards for heavy duty pickup trucks and vans to become 2.5 percent more efficient annually between Model Years 2021 and 2027;\n•      Establishing first time standards for certain trailers used with combination tractors that will cut carbon emissions and fuel consumption by up to 9 percent; and\n•      Finalizing diesel engine standards that will reduce carbon emissions and fuel consumption by up to 5 percent for tractor engines and up to 4 percent for vocational engines compared to the first round of standards.\nACCELERATING TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF COMMERCIAL AND PASSENGER VEHICLES\nIn line with the President's commitment to increase investment in clean energy research, development, and demonstration (RD&D), today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is investing nearly $140 million to improve vehicle and truck efficiency. DOE plans to invest $80 million in funding to develop the next generation of fuel efficient truck technologies. DOE will also invest $57 million in new projects to develop and deploy a wide array of cutting-edge light duty vehicle technologies.\nSupporting Industry in Developing Technologies to Improve the Efficiency of Our Trucks: In 2010, DOE launched the SuperTruck Initiative, supported by historic investments through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, to develop and demonstrate technologies to improve truck freight efficiency by 50 percent. Four competitively-selected teams accepted the challenge – three of those teams have exceeded the 50 percent goal and the fourth team is on track to exceed the target this year. In fact, more than 20 SuperTruck technologies, including advances in aerodynamics and engine/drivetrain integration have reached the commercial market, and more than 25 additional innovations are expected to be commercialized in the next 2-4 years. Building on the success of SuperTruck I, today, DOE is announcing plans to invest up to $80 million, in four new multi-year industry-led SuperTruck II projects to accelerate the development of technologies that can more than double the efficiency of trucks that deliver goods across America.\nBuilding Cleaner Cars, SUVs, Pickups and Minivans: Since President Obama took office, DOE's investments have already helped reduce the high-volume modeled cost of advanced batteries by more than 70 percent. To build on this progress, DOE will invest nearly $60 million in 35 new, cost-shared projects to accelerate the development of technologies for the next-generation plug-in electric and fuel efficient cars, SUVs, pickups, and minivans. These investments in advanced batteries and electric drive systems, stronger and more durable lightweight materials, and more efficient engines will help save consumers money and reduce both carbon emissions and petroleum consumption.\nBuilding on Progress\nWhen President Obama took office, the fuel efficiency standards of our cars and trucks were stuck in the past. With fewer fuel efficient vehicles, American's were paying more for less at the pump, automakers were in crisis, and dangerous carbon pollution from cars and trucks continued to rise. Today, car manufacturers are improving fuel economy and reducing dangerous emissions at lower costs than was widely thought possible just a few years ago, and the number of electric vehicles models available has grown from one to more than 25 models made by 17 major automotive brands. Large trucking fleets across the country are getting cleaner too. The Obama Administration's National Clean Fleets Partnership, which works with large private fleet owners to cut their petroleum use, has had impressive impacts nationwide. In 2015 alone, the partners saved more than 150 million gasoline gallon equivalents of petroleum and averted more than 369,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions.\nContinuing to move the United States to a cleaner transportation system will require decades of dedicated RD&D of advanced technologies – a sustained investment that is consistent with the President's announcement of Mission Innovation alongside more than 20 other nations last year. The actions the Administration is taking today set us on a path toward achieving this goal and moving us towards a lower-carbon transportation system.", "timestamp": "2016-08-16", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Announces New Actions to Spur Innovation and Promote More Efficient Cars and Trucks"}

When one state hurts, we all hurt – and we must all work together to lift each other up. Working, building, restoring together.\nOur prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences. Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.\nWe are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.\nTonight, I'd like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.\nLast week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.\nOn Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.\nOn Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.\nLet me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.\nThe chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens. If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end – and it will end very quickly.\nEvery single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.\nTo be one united nation, we must protect all of our people. But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.\nWe cannot make America great again if we leave any community behind.\nNearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.\nJobs, safety, opportunity. Fair and equal representation. This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.\nBut to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.\nAs you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I've never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I've never been politically correct – it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.\nSometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.\nBut one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.\nI speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice.\nI speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.\nI speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need – and so many are not making it. They are dying.\nI speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.\nOur campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans – Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals – who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don't hear anyone speaking for them. All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.\nThese are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels. The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.\nI am fighting for these forgotten Americans.\nFourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people. Every day since then, I've worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.\nEvery day I think about how much is at stake for this country. This isn't just the fight of my life, it's the fight ofour lives – together – to save our country.\nI refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream. Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved. Let our children be dreamers too.\nOur whole country loses every time a kid doesn't graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.\nWhen I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.\nIn the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.\nIf something isn't working, you replace it.\nIf a product doesn't deliver, you make a change.\nI have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.\nThat's why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity. A future where America, and its people, always – and I mean always – come first.\nAren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?\nAren't you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises? And Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.\nAren't you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?\nThat is all about to change – and it's about to change soon. We are going to put the American people first again.\nI've travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.\nIn this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe. I will never put anyone's interests ahead of yours.\nAnd, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.\nI have no special interest. I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign – nobody else is.\nMy only interest is the American people.\nSo while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.\nThe American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she's told to them, and the many times she's betrayed them.\nTell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?\nHas Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?\nHas she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?\nHas she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?\nHas she apologized for Iraq? For Libya? For Syria? Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?\nHas Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?\nSpeaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran. He denied it was for the hostages, but it was. He said we don't pay ransom, but he did. He lied about the hostages – openly and blatantly – just like he lied about Obamacare.\nNow the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped. Hillary Clinton owns President Obama's Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.\nLet's talk about the economy. Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.\nBill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization – another Hillary Clinton-backed deal. Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State – our chief diplomat with China. She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.\nHillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you'll get that apology around the same time you'll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.\nAnother major issue in this campaign has been the border. Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities. So much needless suffering, so much preventable death. I've spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.\nI've embraced the crying parents who've lost their children to violence spilling across our border. Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.\nMy opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.\nBut where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?\nWhere was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?\nThese moms and dads don't get a lot of consideration from our politicians. They certainly don't get apologies. They'll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.\nBut they will always come first to me.\nListen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families. We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.\nHillary Clinton's mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.\nPlease remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security. I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests. I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs. I will never put the special interests before the national interest. I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.\nInstead, I will be a champion for the people.\nThe establishment media doesn't cover what really matters in this country, or what's really going on in people's lives. They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.\nJust imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed – she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.\nJust imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.\nJust think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools. Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.\nInstead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders. It's the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it's been rigged against.\nSo many people suffering in silence. No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.\nSo again, it's not about me. It's never been about me. It's about all the people in this country who don't have a voice.\nI am running to be their voice.\nI am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.\nI am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again – including some powerful people in my own party. Because it means I am fighting for real change.\nThere's a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.\nIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.\nThe insiders fighting for the insiders.\nI am fighting for you.\nHere is the change I propose.\nOn terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.\nWe will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism. I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens: we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.\nOn immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed. All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn't share our values and love our people. Anyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa. If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life. Those who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.\nWe will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.\nMy opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration. Hillary Clinton is running to be America's Angela Merkel, and we've seen how much crime and how many problems that's caused the German people.\nWe have enough problems already, we don't need another one.\nOn crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world. We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.\nThe gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one. Their day is over.\nOn trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.\nHillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.\nOn taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses – creating millions of new good paying jobs.\nWe are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.\nOn education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive. We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones. My opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy. She doesn't care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.\nWe are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities – and what a big difference that will make. This means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.\nOn healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina. We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare – at a much lower cost.\nOn political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.\nIn my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.\nI am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.\nI am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.\nFinally, we are going to bring this country together. We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.\nIf African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing. Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership – look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working. It is time for change.\nWhat do you have to lose by trying something new? – I will fix it. This means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.\nHillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted. Because the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.\nIt is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.\nIn my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\nThis is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.\nBut we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.\n72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track. I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.\nIt is time to vote for a New American Future.\nTogether, We will make America strong again.\nWe will make American proud again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nFriends and fellow citizens: Come November, we will make America great again.\nThank You, and God Bless.", "timestamp": "2016-08-18", "title": "Remarks at the Charlotte Convention Center in Charlotte, North Carolina"}

But this is not the end of the story. It's just the beginning. You can get rid of Manafort, but that doesn't end the odd bromance Trump has with Putin. Trump still has to answer serious questions hovering over his campaign given his propensity to parrot Putin's talking points, the roster of advisers like Carter Page and Mike Flynn with deep ties to Russia, the recent Russian government hacking and disclosure of Democratic Party records, and reports that Breitbart published articles advocating pro-Kremlin positions on Ukraine. It's also time for Donald Trump to come clean on his own business dealings with Russian interests, given recent news reports about his web of deep financial connections to business groups with Kremlin ties.\"\nHFA also released a new video on Donald Trump's tendency to echo Vladimir Putin's talking points:\nVIDEO: Why do Trump and Putin sound so much alike?\nBACKGROUND\nTrump Campaign Advisers' Russia Connections Extend Far Beyond Manafort\nCarter Page, Trump's pro-Putin foreign policy adviser, built his career on deals with Russia's state owned gas company, Gazprom, and traveled to Moscow just last month.\nWashington Post: Trump adviser's public comments, ties to Moscow stir unease in both parties\n\"In early June, a little-known adviser to Donald Trump stunned a gathering of high-powered Washington foreign policy experts meeting with the visiting prime minister of India, going off topic with effusive praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump. The adviser, Carter Page, hailed Putin as stronger and more reliable than President Obama, according to three people who were present at the closed-door meeting at Blair House — and then touted the positive effect a Trump presidency would have on U.S.-Russia relations. A month later, Page dumbfounded foreign policy experts again by giving another speech harshly critical of U.S. policy — this time in Moscow.\"\nBloomberg: Trump's New Russia Adviser Has Deep Ties to Kremlin's Gazprom\nA globe-trotting American investment banker who's built a career on deals with Russia and its state-run gas company, Carter Page says his business has suffered directly from the U.S. economic sanctions imposed after Russia's escalating involvement in the Ukraine. When Donald Trump named him last week as one of his foreign-policy advisers, Page says his e-mail inbox filled up with positive notes from Russian contacts. \"So many people who I know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy,\" Page said in a two-hour interview last week. \"There's a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.\"\nLt.

Now he's leading 'Lock her up' chants.\nLike Trump, Flynn has advocated forging closer ties with Russia. In interviews with The Washington Post, Flynn acknowledged being paid to give a speech and attend a lavish anniversary party for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network in Moscow last year, where he was seated next to Russian President Vladi­mir Putin…. Asked why he would want to be so closely associated with a Kremlin propaganda platform, Flynn said he sees no distinction between RT and other news outlets. \"What's CNN? What's MSNBC? Come on!\" said Flynn, who also has appeared occasionally as an unpaid on-air analyst for RT and other foreign broadcasters.\nPolitico: The Kremlin's Candidate\nAt a moment of semi-hostility between the U.S. and Russia, the presence of such an important figure at Putin's table startled current and former members of the Obama administration. \"It was extremely odd that he showed up in a tuxedo to the Russian government propaganda arm's party,\" one former Pentagon official told me.\nDaily Beast: Trump Embraces Ex-Top Obama Intel Official\nThree former U.S. officials said that a trip Flynn took last December to Moscow—where he was filmed sitting at the head table next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a formal dinner—set off alarms within military and intelligence circles over whether Flynn had notified the U.S. government about his foreign travel, as his security clearance requires.\nMike McSherry, an aide who helped lead Trump's convention strategy, worked alongside Manafort and Gates to lobby for Putin puppet Yanukovych.\nBuzzFeed: Ukraine Lobbying Contract Linked To Manafort Also Involved Another Trump Aide\n\"Donald Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort is not the only Trump aide to have been involved in lobbying for Ukraine's pro-Russian ex-president.

It's the latest in a long list of relationships that give Trump a financial stake in warm U.S.-Russian relations. Businessman and investor Howard Lorber already donated $100,000 to the Trump Victory fund, has been named as one of Trump's \"best friends\" and even appeared once on \"The Apprentice.\" He is also president and chief executive of the Vector Group, a holding company that has various business interests in Russia. In 1996, Lorber brought Trump to Moscow to look for opportunities for Trump to lend his famous name to development projects there. \"Howard has major investments in Russia,\" Trump told Russian politician Alexander Ivanovich Lebed after his trip to Moscow with Lorber, according to a 1997 profile of Trump in the New Yorker.\nBoris Epshteyn, a senior Trump adviser and surrogate, moderated a 2013 forum at the \"Invest In Moscow!\" Conference and has echoed Kremlin talking points on TV.\nHuffington Post: When It Comes To Donald Trump's Russia Ties, It's All About The Aides\nAnd there's also Boris Epshteyn, a Trump surrogate who frequently appears on television and describes himself as a senior adviser to the campaign.

Trump's most shocking, pro-Kremlin proposal is to \"look into\" recognition of Crimea as a part of Russia…. Trump has demanded that other NATO members essentially pay us for protection… Trump has also disparaged our allies in Asia, creating new opportunities for Russian influence…. On the whole, Trump advocates isolationist policies and an abdication of U.S. leadership in the world. He cares little about promoting democracy and human rights. A U.S. retreat from global affairs fits precisely with Putin's international interests.\nVox: Trump's policies are objectively pro-Russia\nNothing Russia could do, on its own, would help its foreign policy more than what Trump is proposing. He is literally suggesting the United States transform global politics to make it more favorable to Russian interests.\nSlate: Putin's Puppet: If the Russian president could design a candidate to undermine American interests—and advance his own—he'd look a lot like Donald Trump.\nDonald Trump is like the Kremlin's favored candidates, only more so.

The Russian-born businessman had already done a stint in prison for stabbing a man in the face with the stem of a margarita glass, and he was now awaiting sentencing for his role in a Mafia-orchestrated stock fraud scheme… Trump and his lawyers have said that he was not aware of Sater's criminal past when he first signed on to do business with Sater's firm, Bayrock Group. Sater's involvement in the stock fraud was kept secret for years by federal prosecutors because of his role as an informant. But even after elements of Sater's background were disclosed in a 2007 New York Times article, he remained in close proximity to Trump — at one point using Trump Organization office space and business cards.\nWashington Post: \"Putin canceled at the last minute, but he sent a decorative lacquered box, a traditional Russian gift, and a warm note, according to Aras Agalarov, a Moscow billionaire who served as a liaison between Trump and the Russian leader. Still, the weekend was fruitful for Trump. He received a portion of the $14 million paid by Agalarov and other investors to bring the pageant to Moscow. Agalarov said he and Trump signed an agreement to build a Trump Tower in the heart of Moscow — at least Trump's fifth attempt at such a venture.\"\nTrump and his campaign have been aligned with the Russians while they attempt to defeat Hillary Clinton.\nNew York Times: Spy Agency Consensus Grows That Russia Hacked D.N.C.\nAmerican intelligence agencies have told the White House they now have \"high confidence\" that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee, according to federal officials who have been briefed on the evidence.\nAP: Donald Trump encourages Russian hackers to spy on Hillary Clinton\n\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\" Trump said. \"I think you'll be rewarded mightily by our press!\"\nWashington Post: Trump allies, WikiLeaks and Russia are pushing a nonsensical conspiracy theory about the DNC hacks\nTrump campaign surrogates are fueling a conspiracy theory that a murdered Democratic National Committee staffer was connected to the hacking of the DNC, a theory being pushed by WikiLeaks and the Russian state-controlled press.\nBuzzFeed: Exclusive: How Ukraine Wooed Conservative Websites\nSeveral conservative bloggers repeated talking points given to them by a proxy group for the Ukrainian government — and at least one writer was paid by a representative of the Ukrainian group, according to documents and emails obtained by BuzzFeed. The Ukrainian campaign began in the run-up to high-stakes Ukrainian parliamentary elections last year, and sought to convince skeptical American conservatives that the pro-Russian Party of Regions, led by President Viktor Yanukovych, deserved American support. During that period, articles echoing Ukrainian government talking points appeared on leading conservative online outlets, including RedState, Breitbart, and Pajamas Media. [emphasis added]\nSome experts have gone as far as to say that Putin is explicitly using Trump to further his agenda.\nReuters: Senior ex-CIA official: Putin made Trump 'an unwitting agent' of Russia\nA former top CIA official attacked Donald Trump on Friday as a danger to national security, saying President Vladimir Putin had made the Republican presidential candidate an \"unwitting agent\" of Russia. Putin had flattered Trump into supporting positions favorable to Russia, Michael Morell, a longtime CIA officer and former deputy director of the agency, said in an opinion piece in The New York Times. \"In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation,\" Morell said\"\nPolitico: Is Putin playing Trump like he did Berlusconi?\n[T]he Berlusconi-Putin bromance has acquired a new resonance, as foreign policy analysts and even some U.S. officials see unsettling echoes in the recent long-distance kinship between the Russian leader and Donald J. Trump. It may even suggest that Putin is applying a specific method to the GOP nominee. In recent years Putin has befriended several major Western European politicians, including former leaders of France and Germany, who openly challenge U.S. and European policies toward Russia, including NATO's buildup in Eastern Europe and economic sanctions punishing Putin's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.\nEven top Republicans have raised serious concerns about Trump's relationship with Putin's Russia.\nNew York Times: 50 G.O.P. Officials Warn Donald Trump Would Put Nation's Security 'at Risk'\nMany of those signing it had declined to add their names to the letter released in March. But a number said in recent interviews that they changed their minds once they heard Mr. Trump invite Russia to hack Mrs. Clinton's email server — a sarcastic remark, he said later — and say that he would check to see how much NATO members contributed to the alliance before sending forces to help stave off a Russian attack. They viewed Mr. Trump's comments on NATO as an abandonment of America's most significant alliance relationship. Mr. Trump has said throughout his campaign that he intends to upend Republican foreign policy orthodoxy on everything from trade to Russia, where he has been complimentary of President Vladimir V. Putin, saying nothing about its crackdown on human rights and little about its annexation of Crimea.\nWashington Post: Republicans are among a new list of foreign policy experts denouncing Trump\nSeveral Republicans are among a group of former cabinet officers, senior officials and career military officers who denounced Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday, calling his recent remarks on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia \"disgraceful.\" The open letter, released first to The Washington Post, takes issue with Trump statements that appear to question the alliance, encourage Russia to hack and release Hillary Clinton's deleted State Department emails, and seem to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea, which the United States considers illegitimate.\nTrump has praised Putin for a decade, and Putin has returned the favor.\nTrump, 2007: \"[Putin's] doing a great job.

Looking at Mr. Ruganvic's (ph) photograph or painting as I came down the stairs. I've met with him many times, as well. It goes back a long way.\nAnd I always enjoy coming. People back home ask me why I keep coming to Kosovo. It's because every time I come, particularly when I speak to you, Mr. President, I go back reinvigorated. I go back hopeful. I go back with the unyielding belief that years, decades, centuries of enmity and hostility can be overcome. You and I were in a long conversation upstairs. And President Obama always kids me because I keep saying, all politics is personal, particularly in international relations. And you essentially said the same thing. It takes personalities who are willing to fight very hard for what they know is in the interest of their country, even sometimes when it's not in their own political interest. And that always gives me hope. It gives me hope.\nAnd I will leave here today when I leave this evening with a renewed sense of hope and quite frankly feeling vindicated that I was smart enough to be captivated by all of you years ago and be among the first to argue for Kosovo's independence. You're making me a hero. (Laughter.)\nBut on a very serious note, this is a particularly meaningful visit for my family and me -- including my wife, Jill; my son Hunter, the love of my life; my two grandchildren, and Beau Biden's wife, Hallie, and his two children.\nI wanted them to be here. I wanted them to see Kosovo. I wanted them to taste it. I wanted them to feel it. And when my Beau, who was the attorney general of my state and a fine man, and a decorated war veteran coming back from a year in Iraq, he volunteered back early on to come to Kosovo in the middle of the war. The war was just ending. And he came not as a soldier. He came as a member of the United States Department of Justice to help, at the request of some, to advance justice and the rule of law here in Kosovo back in 2001.\nAnd he loved it here. He grew to love the people. I mean this sincerely. He had an overwhelming sense of affection. And it was his strong belief from having been here in the depths of very difficult times that made me confident that calling for the independence of this great country was the right thing to do. Sometimes it's better to listen to your sons than your sons to listen to you.\nMy father used to have an expression, Mr. Prime Minister -- I remember you as Prime Minister as well -- Mr. President, and that was he said, it's a lucky parent who turns and looks at his child and realizes his child turned out better than he was.\nI was, indeed, a successful parent because Beau was a better man than I am, and he sensed right away how important Kosovo should, could, and will be in the region.\nSo later this afternoon, as a consequence of the generosity of your parliament, you, and the Prime Minister, and the people of Kosovo, I will, with my family, be attending a ceremony to name a portion of the road in front of Camp Bondsteel after my Beau.\nAnd I want to thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank the Prime Minister Mustafa, and all the people of Kosovo for the friendship that you have shown me personally, and to the Biden family generally.\nAnd I don't -- this is not hyperbole to suggest we genuinely, genuinely, genuinely appreciate it.\nYou know, Mr. President, we've known each other for a long time. And I'm here for an even much more important reason than merely to honor my son and to thank you for honoring him.\nLet me begin by congratulating you on your election to President. And I know from my experience and our many, many hours of discussions how deeply you care about Kosovo and how committed you are to its future as a free, open, independent, and full integrated European nation.\nThere's an expression I use in my country when young women or men will come to me and ask me if they're going to run for office. They say, what's the most important thing I have to know? And I tell them -- and I mean this sincerely -- I tell them the same thing for the last 44 years, have you figured out what it's worth losing over? Have you figured out what is essentially more important than you as to the reason why you're doing what you're doing?\nYou figured it out. You put your country first, and it shows. And the rest of the world is following your leadership.\nAnd I'm here today to affirm the United States is going to continue to stand with the people of Kosovo on your journey to become a prosperous and peaceful multi-ethnic democracy; and to join the Euro-Atlantic and international community.\nAnd by the way, I don't say that as the American saying we're coming here to help -- that's not what this is about. This is overwhelmingly -- your success is overwhelmingly in the interest of my country. Overwhelmingly. For if you succeed, the region will succeed -- a region of Europe that has never been fully, thoroughly integrated into Europe.\nAnd our vision and the vision of most European leaders and the world is for Europe whole, free, and united. And it matters a lot to the United States of America.\nSo although we're deeply engaged and we'll do all we can to help, we're not doing you a favor. It's overwhelmingly in our interest you succeed.\nI was last here in 2009. I remember at the time right after we got elected, I came here. And they said, well, why is this among your first visits? Why is it -- you've just been elected. You've just been sworn in. Why Kosovo?\nWell, it was just one year after you had gained your independence. And it was a time in which we, the President and I and our administration, wanted to demonstrate that our commitment to is real. It's not passing. It's not something that is ephemeral. It's real. Again, because it's in our interest.\nNow, seven years later, I'm proud to return to see the tremendous progress that Kosovo has made. You've gained greater global recognition. Every time you've come to my office, you've said, will you call the following Presidents, Joe? He gives me a list when he comes as to what countries that hadn't -- you know I'm not kidding. But now -- not because of me or the United States -- but because of what you've done, you're in a position where the world is recognizing you. You've gained greater global recognition, but you've also -- including competing under your own flag -- and Majlinda, you should meet this young woman. She has to be strong to hold up that gold medal. I lifted it. I had my grandchildren lift it. It must weigh I don't know what. And fortunately, my young granddaughter, who is 12, said, Pop, what did she win it in? I said, judo. She said, like fighting? I said, like judo, yes. (Laughter.) She said, boy, she must be strong. But it was wonderful for you to have her at the airport to meet us. You made me a hero with my grandchildren.\nAnd as I said in my last visit, your democracy and independence are a force for regional stability. There's no going back. If you nail down this independence and capacity to govern the way you're on your to doing, this will have an impact ripple throughout the region. It's not just about Kosovo. And your firm commitment, as you stood here today, in spite of a strong minority -- a minority view that sometimes is somewhat over the top in not wanting you to sign the agreement you negotiated with Montenegro -- as an example of your leadership, standing here before your countrymen and the whole world and saying, this is important. It is a fair agreement. It is a fair agreement. It is a fair agreement. And your commitment to see it come to fruition will have a very positive impact in the region.\nYou've had to make some very difficult decisions and push necessary reforms -- even when they weren't popular. That's something President Obama and I know a little bit about, coming into office as you're losing 800,000 jobs a month is not a usual welcoming environment to come in. But those decisions over the period of time have proven to be correct for our economy. None of the easy decisions are usually consequential. But the difficult decisions you've made that are unpopular are beginning to bear fruit.\nI know that for many, the scars of war and the pain of loss are still very raw. I was in and out of this region of the world in middle of the wars 28 times. I witnessed it. I saw it. I was in shelters. I was in bombed-out buildings. I was visiting newspapers that were two stories underground. I was visiting hospitals. I saw with my own eyes only a portion of the suffering and the carnage that took place.\nBut, although these scars are still raw, the only way for Kosovo to move forward is to assure a united future and to advance reconciliation -- to ensure the rights of every citizen is protected.\nMr. President, I commend you for your participation in the wreath-laying at Staro Gracko -- I'm mispronouncing it, and I apologize -- last month, for honoring Kosovo-Serb victims of the violence of 1999. And for your words yesterday, commemorating the children who were killed in 2003.\nI know these were controversial decisions in some quarters, but they are very important testimony to the progress that Kosovo is making under you and the leadership of your nation.\nToday, with both the President and the Prime Minister, we talked about the necessary steps that lie ahead for Kosovo, and how the United States may be able to be of continued support and help in that march toward progress.\nAnd it starts with pursuing closer cooperation and peaceful negotiations with your neighbor -- even your former enemies. President Thaci and Prime Minister Mustafa have shown great commitment to advancing the EU-facilitated Brussels Dialogue with Serbia in order to move toward normalization of relations between Pristina and Belgrade; including not only the demarcation line, which is nothing to do with Brussels, but is kind of change that has to occur with your neighbors, in terms of the Brussels dialogue of moving forward to establish an Association of Serb-Majority Municipalities.\nIt will be difficult, but it is necessary and important, urgent work. And I had the same conversation, as I pointed out to you, Mr. President, with Prime Minister Vucic yesterday. We talked about it at length. And he understands, as he expressed to me, the need to move forward, as well. Both of you face headwinds in your country on some of this, but you both understand what has to be done.\nBoth sides have a responsibility to follow through on the commitments you made in Brussels and to look for new areas to keep the dialogue moving forward once that's done. It can't be the end. It should be the beginning. This is critical for advancing Kosovo and Serbia's full integration into Europe. Without it, it will not likely happen.\nAnd as you continue this work, the United States is going to continue to stand by your side, Mr. President, because we believe in Kosovo. Since your independence, the United States has provided almost $2 billion of help, and there is more help available with continued change. That $2 billion is used to promote governance and democracy, advance peace and security initiatives, implement social development programs, spur economic growth, and provide humanitarian relief.\nBut ultimately, we hope to welcome a strong, democratic, multi-ethnic Kosovo as a full member of the European family. Because the use of violence and intimidation to disrupt lawful democratic processes, some of which you've seen here, are completely, thoroughly, totally unacceptable.\nAnother key issue President Thaci and the Prime Minister and I discussed today was need for greater economic growth and prosperity across Kosovo. If you look at history, folks, no fledgling democracy has been able to sustain itself without economic prosperity, without economic growth. And economic growth cannot be sustained in the absence of the rule of law. It's not because the United States says that or because the U.N. -- it's because -- there's sort of new laws of physics for the economy. People will only invest where there is transparency. Companies will invest only where they know there is a rule of law. They'll only invest where they know what they negotiated can be litigated and upheld within those courts of law; will only invest where they don't have to engage in bribery and coercion. That is the new norm for our global economy.\nAnd in order for you to take advantage of the incredible talent you have here interests his country, there is a need to continue, which you have been pushing, to deal with corruption and organized crime.\nThat's why it's absolutely critical that the government continue fight impunity by closing loopholes in the criminal code; professionalize public appointments and take zero-tolerance approach to corruption; including preventing indicted and convicted officials from continuing in their positions; and increase the democratic accountability of the government.\nCorruption is a cancer that eats at the fabric of every society where it exists. And that's not hyperbole. I spend my time on behalf of the President going around the world trying to be of some value added. We not -- we always don't make it. But every country that is riven with corruption as a consequence of the last government that has -- that they've been able to overthrow or move away from is struggling. They're struggling economically. Corruption is a cancer. And unless it's dealt with, the likelihood of bringing down the unemployment rate, the likelihood of raising the standard of living, the likelihood of Kosovo meeting its potential is not likely.\nAnd so ultimately we hope to welcome a strong, as I said, democratic, multi-ethnic Kosovo as a full member of the European family, free of corruption. But the use of violence, as I said, and intimidation is something that is not tolerable in any modern democracy.\nCorruption drains the economic resources away from the people and drives away business and investment. It weakens a nation's ability to defend itself. It leaves it vulnerable to manipulation from outside. In short, it jeopardizes everything Kosovo hopes to achieve, hopes to achieve, hopes to become, hopes for its future. The rule of law has to apply equally to everyone. The justice system has to be equitable, and it has to be transparent.\nThat's why in the first instance in 2001, my son Beau came here to work toward that kind of system, long before Kosovo achieved independence. And that's what we encouraged -- we're encouraged by the people like you who believe that we have to continue to move in this direction so a future for themselves and their families can be achieved here in Kosovo -- and people stop leaving and start coming back, instead of leaving.\nKosovo is not alone. You have friends ready to help all over the world -- and no greater friend than the United States of America. We want to help you transform your economy, reduce poverty, and promote a more prosperous future for the people of Kosovo and the children of Kosovo.\nThat's why, last December, the Millennium Challenge Corporation selected Kosovo to create a new development assistance compact between our nations. That could potentially provide hundreds of millions of dollars -- direct dollars to Kosovo -- to help foster a better environment for business growth and to draw outside investment, which will create urgently needed jobs.\nWe want to help strengthen your energy security, as well. That's why we support the construction of the new Kosovo C power plant, which will provide Kosovo with reliable power and unlock economic growth.\nWe want to continue cooperating to advance our shared security, and that's why you made reference it a little bit earlier, that's why, Mr. President, we want to compliment as President and the Prime Minister on the important work that you've done to combat the flow of foreign fighters. You have done it. I want the world to listen. They have done it. We know they have done it. They have been highly, highly successful. And it matters.\nIt took incredible fortitude and resilience over many years for the people of Kosovo to gain their independence. But that was only the first step. Much of the hard work still lies ahead. You're going to continue to need to draw on your courage, Mr. President, and determination to meet these challenges. All of your countrymen are going to have to do that.\nThe work of democracy is never done. We know -- 240 years after our independence, the United States of America still works daily toward what we call \"a more perfect union.\" And we are not there yet. We are still dealing with our own problems internally.\nSo as you continue to make progress on your democratic path, know the United States is going to continue to be champion for the people of Kosovo. And we will keep advocating around the world in every international organization for a strong and independent Kosovo that is an integral part of a Europe whole, free and at peace.\nAnd with your leadership and the leadership of the Prime Minister and all of your colleagues, I am absolutely confident this is a path you can walk. This is a path you can walk down. This is an objective you can achieve. And when you do fully achieve it, Mr. President, every single country in the region will be better for it.\nSo thank you for all your hard work and your courage in moving forward.", "timestamp": "2016-08-19", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at the Conclusion of a Meeting with President Hashim Thaci of Kosovo in Pristina, Kosovo"}
{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121172", "text": "VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister, (inaudible).\nI'll start again. Thank you, very much Mr. Prime Minister. And I told the Prime Minister as he greeted me at the limousine for that beautiful formal welcome, as they were playing the national anthems of both our countries, we stood on that platform. As we walked away, I said, my expectation is your water polo team will be standing on a similar platform very soon. And I'm glad to hear other of your countrymen are standing on that platform.\nAs you know, we in the United States -- we don't take it very seriously. We don't pay much attention to gold medals. I'm only kidding, obviously. It's a great scene to watch. It makes you think as a leader who has been involved in national security issues and foreign policy for 40 years, imagine if we could settle all our differences the way they're settled at the Olympics and with the winners and losers embracing.\nBut, Mr. Prime Minister, you're going a long way to make your country a winner all the way around. This is not the first time we've met. Presumptuous of me to say this, I think we've become friends. I always enjoy it when you're able to be in the United States.\nAnd I want to thank you for the welcome you've showed me at the airport. You've made me seem like a very important grandfather to my 13-year-old granddaughter as she came down the stairs. And so I want to thank you for that.\nMy visit today is much too short, but I believe we have accomplished a great deal. The Prime Minister and I have gotten to know each other over the past several years, and I mean this sincerely, I -- along with President Obama -- respect the leadership you've shown in some very tough challenging moments, Mr. Prime Minister, and your positive vision for the future of Croatia [sic].\nI'll say what I said privately with your colleagues, I'll say it again, I have for the last three decades viewed Croatia and all the rest of our neighbors -- Kosovo, Montenegro, everyone in the neighborhood -- as an essential part of what I think is needed for a Europe that is whole and free and united for the first time. And Serbia is the keystone to that.\nIf Serbia does well economically and politically, the entire region does well and will do well. And I've not worked on issues in this region for the -- at least the last four decades. My first visit was back in 1997 [sic], before the breakup of Yugoslavia. I was recounting one of the most fascinating meetings I've ever had in my life with President Tito in Split at his residence there with a gentleman named Averill Harriman, an esteemed American diplomat. And I felt like I was reliving specific incidents in World War II. They were both hard of hearing. We were sitting a little dining room table, and they were hollering at each other so they could hear one another. And to hear them talk about Franklin and Joe Stalin and Franklin Roosevelt, it was like something -- like history coming alive. That was my first visit. And I've been here a number of times since.\nAnd I believe this -- today, this year, this period is a moment of genuine opportunity for Serbia.\nI witnessed firsthand the incredible progress Serbia has made in a relatively short period of time. And as I said when I visited back in 2009, the United States is committed to supporting the people of Serbia as you continue on your journey.\nWe don't do that out of nobility. We do that because it's overwhelmingly in the self-interest of the United States of America for the people of Serbia to be able to grow and prosper. I mean that sincerely. I mean that sincerely.\nAnd to support a strong, successful, democratic member of the Euro-Atlantic community is overwhelmingly -- not only in Serbia's interest, as you've all stated, but is in the interest of Europe. And it's an interest of a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace.\nBut, together, we are steadily working to change that circumstance into reality. Serbia's success and leadership is critical to the overall success, as I've mentioned earlier, of Southeastern Europe.\nThere is a long history between our two countries, the United States and Serbia. Not all of it good. Some of it painful. But I'm proud that the United States and Serbia\nhave started a new chapter in our relationship, grounded on the shared ideas of mutual respect.\nAnd today, Mr. Prime Minister, you and I discussed how to continue to deepen that partnership between our nations.\nFirst, we discussed the importance of moving forward with an EU-facilitated Brussels Dialogue, so that Serbia and Kosovo can continue making progress to normalize relations. It is difficult. There is nothing easy about it. There is a lot of history to overcome.\nThis is an issue that I'll also be raising in Kosovo tomorrow with the leaders in Pristina. As I said, it's not easy. It's going to take a lot of hard work and political will to overcome the divisions. But I'm convinced that you and your team have already and will continue to do all you can to bring it to fruition.\nIf both sides remain committed to a future of peace and greater prosperity, it's going to help both nations move closer to joining the European Union.\nAnd I commended the Prime Minister for his efforts to continue advancing broader regional reconciliation, including attending what he did last year at the 20th anniversary of Srebrenica and signing a Joint Declaration with the Croatian President. It took a lot of courage. It took a lot of leadership. And it's the measure of the man that I've come to know.\nSecondly, we talked about the importance of Serbia continuing the path of reform. I've said often around the world there is sort of a new physics almost of economic growth. Not laid down by any country or any rules. But there are certain things that have to exist for countries to prosper. Because we're in a global economy, companies and individuals will not invest that there's not transparency. They will not invest where there's not rule of law. Not dictated by any country, not dictated by any international agreement. It's just a reality. It's just a reality.\nAnd the fact of the matter is that there is a considerable interest around the world and in the United States for further foreign direct investment in Serbia. You have an extremely talented population, and you have an extremely, extremely hopeful future.\nAnd so we expressed our commitment to implementing the reform agenda and the Serbian people -- that the Serbian people overwhelmingly voted for in April. And the United States stands ready to help Serbia navigate the difficult road ahead.\nAlready we're seeing the impact of the economic reforms that the Serbian government has put in place. As the Prime Minister pointed out, the economy is growing and predicted to grow even faster. You're drawing more international investment, including from my country. American companies are providing thousands of\nquality jobs for Serbian workers. And our economic partnership is going to continue to grow as we keep strengthening our economic ties.\nWe're also seeing the impact reforms -- the reforms that have impact on advancing the relationship between Serbia and the European Union. I congratulated Prime Minister Vucic on Serbia's opening two more chapters in their accession negotiations with the EU. It's a critical step that commits Serbia to ensure equal access to justice, strengthening an independent judiciary, and resolve war crime cases.\nThe rule of law is the backbone of all successful democracies. And very few democracies are successful without economic growth and economic prosperity. And a free media and a vibrant civil society are essential components for allowing people to feel invested in their governments and communities. Nations are stronger when they hear from many voices.\nCivil society is a vital source of new ideas and energy that can help a country advance and make sure that governments are accountable to the people they serve. These voices must be protected and respected.\nSerbian civil society can also be an important ally in rooting out corruption that hollows out institutions, weakens economies, siphons resources away from people. And that is literally an act of patriotism when that occurs.\nThird, we talked about all the ways Serbia and the\nUnited States can continue to advance our bilateral relationships. Yesterday, we reached a new extradition treaty. Not since 1902 has that occurred, the first upgrade of that agreement between our two countries in more than a century.\nThis treaty will enable much more effective cooperation between our countries on law enforcement. And what it says even more importantly is that the international norms that have become the standard for advanced countries are being shared between our countries.\nThe treaty, as I said, will enable more effective cooperation between our countries in law enforcement. We also addressed the growing security cooperation. Serbia and the United States already share a strong military-to-military relationship. Our troops train together. We stand together to combat terrorism of ISIL and other violent extremists. And we share a commitment to global peacekeeping.\nAnd we continue expanding our ability to work together by helping Serbia modernize its military equipment, increasing Serbian military's interoperability with NATO forces.\nAnd, in an issue that's very close to my heart, I'm encouraged that -- although we didn't have a chance to discuss it in our meeting -- that we're exploring opportunities to increase our joint efforts for cancer research and prevention and management so that we can end the scourge of cancer as we know it as part of my government's so-called Cancer Moonshot. We are really anxious to work with your scientists and your doctors, Mr. Prime Minister.\nAnd finally, today, the United States and Serbia have I think reached another point in the maturation of our agreement. Even though we don't always agree on every issue, for many throughout the region, the scars of the wars in the 1990s are still raw. The memories of lost loved ones are still fresh. But I am hopeful that the steps we are taking to ensure future governments and future generations, I should say, grow up in the region marked by peace, stability, and greater prosperity.\nAnd that's why, Mr. Prime Minister, I appreciate the comments you just made taking responsibility, to the extent it existed, for wrongs, hoping other countries will take equal responsibility for transgressions they may have engaged in, and offering your condolences of the lives lost --- Serbs and Kosovar Albanians alike. This is an important, important step forward to healing. It's a difficult, difficult, difficult process.\nAnd I would like to add my condolences to the families of those whose lives were lost during the wars of the '90s, including as a result of the NATO air campaign, in terms of responsibility.\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, when I came to Belgrade in 2009, just a few months after President Obama and I took office, it was intended by the President and me to demonstrate to the people of Serbia America's enduring commitment to the region and our desire for a strong relationship between our two nations.\nThat's the same reason I'm here today. The only difference is we've even become closer friends since that first visit.\nAnd over the past several years, Mr. Prime Minister, we've learned just how much we can achieve if we work together.\nSo thank you and your colleagues once more for your partnership and your commitment to advancing the relationship. And I am optimistic. There are an awful lot of problems facing the region. But I am optimistic -- maybe because I've been doing this such a long time. And I've seen the progress that's moved as quickly as it has.\nAs long as we have leaders like you in the region, as long as we are committed to making progress, I am absolutely, positively convinced our publics will support the efforts we're making. And things will continue to get better.\nAnd thank you for your leadership, Mr. President.", "timestamp": "2016-08-19", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President at the Conclusion of a Meeting with Prime Minister Vucic of Serbia in Belgrade, Serbia"}

Wow, look at that. Boy. What a crowd. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. We just set a record in this building, folks, so that's good news. That's fantastic. Thank you. [applause]\nI love Michigan, and I must tell you, come November, to be specific, November 8th, with your help, we are going to win and we are going to win big. [applause]\nAnd we are going to the White House and we are going to bring jobs back to our country and we are going to bring jobs back to Michigan. [applause]\nIt's going to be a victory for the people, a victory for the wage-earner, the factory worker. Remember this, a big, big victory for the factory worker. They haven't had those victories for a long time. A victory for every citizen and for all of the people whose voices have not been heard for many, many years. They're going to be heard again. [applause]\nIt'll be a win for the voters, not for the pundits, not for the journalists, not for the lobbyists, not for the global special interests funding my opponent's campaign. [booing]\nIt's going to be your victory. [applause]\nThese are hard times for many in this country. I just got back from a tour of the suffering and devastation in Louisiana. Perhaps you can tell by the way I'm dressed. Just got off the plane. It was actually incredible. The spirit of the people is incredible. The devastation, likewise, they've never seen anything like it, but the spirit of the people is incredible. And honestly, Obama ought to get off the golf course and get down there. [applause]\nWe mourn for the lives lost and we pledge our help, comfort and support to every last person in need. To the people of Louisiana, we are with you and we will always be with you. [applause]\nIn my vision, I saw not only the suffering of our people but also their strength, courage and really unbeatable spirit. Their spirit will overcome. We have a lot to overcome in our country, especially the fact that our jobs are being taken away from us and going to other lands, and we're not going to allow it to happen, and especially it's happening right here in Michigan. [applause]\nIt's an amazing spirit that we will need to rebuild our country. It's that strength that we're going to need to create the new American future our children so much deserve. [applause]\nIn this new -- thank you. Thank you very much. In this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the work force. And if I'm not elected president, that will never happen, believe me. They're talking to you, they're playing you, but believe me, you know the answer.\nAnd I have to say that I've been talking about Michigan and the car industry and how your businesses and plants have been ripped out of your land, and I have been doing it for four years to the people of Michigan. Other people started talking about it last week. They're not going to do anything about it.\nCrumbling roads, bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves. [applause]\nFamilies strapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity. Children stuck in failing government schools will be able to attend the school of their choice. [applause]\nGovernment will become lean, effective, responsible and honest. [applause]\nOur border will be protected and our children will be safe, very, very safe. [applause]\nAnd we will build the wall, don't worry about it. We will build the wall. [applause]\nLaw and order will be restored and the poorest places in our country will know safety and peace again. [applause]\nAmerican values and cultures will be cherished - and I mean cherished and celebrated once again. But to achieve this new American future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past, and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies over and over, and over again. [applause]\nNo group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies than African-Americans no group. No group. If Hillary Clinton's goal was to inflict pain on the African-American community, she could not have done a better job. It is a disgrace. [applause]\nTonight I'm asking for the vote of every single African-American citizen in this country who wants to see a better future. [applause]\nThe inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic party for more than 50 years. Their policies have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, and broken homes. It's time to hold democratic politicians accountable for what they have done to these communities. At what point do we say enough? [applause]\nAt what point do we say enough? [applause]\nIt is time to hold failed leaders accountable for their results, not just their empty words over and over again. Look at what the democratic party has done to the city as an example and there are many others, of Detroit. 40 percent of Detroit's residents, 40 percent, live in poverty. Half of all Detroit residents do not work, and cannot work, and can't get a job\nDetroit tops the list of most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime, number one. This is the legacy of the democratic politicians who have run this city. This is the result of the policy agenda embraced by crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing]\n33,000 e-mails gone. [booing]\nThe only way to change results is to change leadership. [applause]\nWe can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created our problems in the first place. A new future requires brand new leadership. [applause]\nLook at how much African-American communities are suffering from democratic control. To those I say the following, what do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? What do you have to lose? [applause]\nI say it again, what do you have to lose? Look, you're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. 58% of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?\nAnd at the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95% of the African American vote. I promise you. Because I will produce, I will produce for the inner cities and I will produce for the African Americans. And the Democrats will not produce and all they have done is taken advantage of your vote. That's all they've done. And once the election is over, they go back to their palaces in Washington. And you know what? They do nothing for you. Just remember it.\nSo, you have nothing to lose. One thing we know for sure: if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same, exactly the same, results.\nMy administration will go to work for you as no one has ever done before.\nWe will work. We will bring back jobs. We will work.\nBy contrast, the one thing every item in Hillary Clinton's agenda has in common is that it takes jobs and opportunities away from African American workers.\nIt takes jobs away from all workers because your companies are leaving Michigan. Your companies are leaving every single state in our union. They're going to Mexico. They're going everywhere but here.\nHillary Clinton supports open borders. Which means many things but it means people pouring and they take your jobs.\nWhether you like it or don't like it. They take your jobs.\nHer fierce opposition to school choice. You need choice. You have to get your children into good schools. You do that through competition. You need choice.\nHer plan to massively raise taxes on small business and everyone. $1.3 trillion tax increase. Where as I am cutting taxes very substantively for business and for the middle class.\nHer tremendous opposition to American energy. Her opposition is fierce and her record of giving our jobs away to many many other countries. America must reject the bigot dream of Hillary Clinton who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.\nHillary Clinton would rather provide a job to a refugee from overseas that to give that job to unemployed African American youth in cities like Detroit, who have become refugees in their own country.\nIt's time to get our country back to work and that includes an all out effort. To help young African Americans get the good paying jobs that they deserve.\nHillary Clinton's plan would bring in an estimated 620,000 refugees in her first term at a lifetime benefit cost of some $400 billion to our country. According to the Senate Immigration Subcommittee.\nHillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel. By the way, for the price of supporting one refugee in the United States, we could support 12 in a safe zone in the Middle East or let's say Syria.\nThe approved refugee screening standards that I have proposed will save countless, billions of dollars. It's called extreme vetting. Extreme vetting. [applause]\nWe will invest a portion of the money saved in the jobs program for inner city youth. The African American community has given so much to this country. They fought and died in every war since the Revolution.\nThey've lifted up the conscience of our nation in the long march towards civil rights. They've sacrificed so much for the national good. Yet, nearly 4 in 10 African Americans children still live in poverty and 58%, as I said, of African Americans are not working.\nThey cannot find a job.\nWe must do better as a country. I refuse to believe that the future must be like the past. It won't be. Our future will be a great future for everyone. For everyone. [applause]\nIn a Trump administration, all workers of all colors will get priorities for jobs in their own country which is about time.\nI want higher wages for African Americans, for Hispanic Americans, and for all Americans. We want higher wages [applause]\nMany, many workers in our country are making substantially less money today in real wages than they made 18 years ago.\nThey're working two jobs instead of one. They're working much harder as they get older and it's supposed to be the opposite.\nWe're gonna stop it. We're going to create great jobs and we're gonna get the wages up.\nHillary Clinton, is a throwback to an ugly past where politicians preyed on our poorest citizens while selling them out for personal gain. Promises, promises, all talk no action. All talk, no action politicians.\nThey talk, talk, talk. You vote them in with great fan fare and then they just do nothing.\nWith Trump, that is not going to happen. Believe me.\nWe must turn the page on yesterday, only a change in leadership will produce a change in outcomes. And we can't take, as a country, four more years of Obama. And that's what you get with Hillary Clinton but probably worse.\nIn this new American future, American workers will always come first. America first, always come first.\nThis will include a complete revitalization of the Michigan manufacturing sector. Now, you have to understand, the Michigan manufacturing sector is a disaster. Is a disaster.\nLook at your notes, look at your stats, look at what's happening to your state. You're losing your businesses. It's like taking candy away from a baby. And many people right now in this audience that think you have jobs, you're gonna find out very soon that your company is leaving from Mexico or some other place and you're not going to have your job for very long.\nAnd if Trump gets in, those days are over folks, they're over [applause]\nWe will be brining back our jobs to Michigan. There will be a very big price to pay for those companies that wanna leave our land, go someplace else, manufacture their goods, and sell back with no retribution.\nIt won't happen. There will be consequence. Won't happen. It will not happen.\nMichigan lost more than 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.\nAs you know, NAFTA, one of the worst trade bills in history maybe, maybe the worst trade bill signed in the history of the world. Not only in our country. Its emptied out Michigan, its emptied out New England. Its emptied out New York State. Its emptied out so many of our great companies.\nThey leave and they fire. We end up with devastation. We end up with unemployment. We end up with nothing.\nThe bill was signed by Bill Clinton. [booing]\nIt was supported by Hillary Clinton. [booing]\nRight here in this community, you have lost 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton put China into the World Trade Organization. Another Hillary Clinton back deal. She backs all the deals.\nAnd by the way, she will be backing Trans Pacific Partnership. TPP. If she is elected. Just mark your words. Just remember, you know it's gonna happen.\nShe considered it the gold standard. All of a sudden when she heard me talking about it, she said \"I can't win this one\" so she went against it. She will go back immediately, and you saw that when the governor of Virginia, who's her friend, said that was going to happen.\nDetroit lost more than 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs following the NAFTA and WTO agreements. That was supported very strongly by my opponent.\nNo industry, has been hurt more by Hillary Clinton's policies than the automobile industry or as we call it the car industry. It has been a total disaster.\nAccording to the Bureau of the Labor of Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is down to only 160,000 and it is going to be a lot lower because if you look at the massive plants being built right now in Mexico, car plants, folks, you can kiss these jobs goodbye. [booing]\nBut not me. Not with me. It won't happen. [applause]\nIn 2014, General Motors announced plans to double its investments in Mexico by plans by 2018. Not good. [booing]\nIn April 2016, Ford Motor Company announced plans to invest another $1.6 billion constructing an auto plant in Mexico. Mexico will become the car capital of the world very, very quickly. And Michigan is going to end up with lots of empty buildings all over the place unless you elect Donald Trump president. In which case, it's not gonna happen. [applause]\nIn same month, Fiat Chrysler announced 1,300 layoffs. The list goes on and on. We will turn it around, we will turn it around fast. We will meet with these companies and we will say, it will not be easy for you to move your plant to Mexico for you sell your cars through what will be a very strong border, and for you not to pay tax on those cars coming in, okay? [applause]\nAnd when we tell them that there will be a substantial tax on the cars that they make in Mexico and other places, number one, they're not going to move in the first place, and number two, if they do, our country will make one heck of a lot of money. [applause]\nBut to save your jobs and do all of the things that I'm talking about, we have to win on November 8th. [applause]\nThe destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Transpacific Partnership is approved. It will be almost, nothing is as bad as NAFTA, but it will be almost as bad as NAFTA.\nWe know from Hillary's closest friend, that she is planning to ram through TPP if she's elected. She even called it, as I said, the gold standard. Its passage would be a disaster for Michigan, in particular, for the car industry in particular, for the people of Michigan. I won't let it happen. [applause]\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, the United States trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over one million manufacturing jobs in our country in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parks, which lost nearly 740,000 think of that 740,000 manufacturing jobs. Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to trade deficit with TPP members.\nJust imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if Hillary gets her wish and approves TPP. It will not be pretty. That's why I have announced that we will withdrawal from the deal before that deal can ever, ever, ever happen. [applause]\nI have have previously laid out a detailed seven-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation from countries like China and tariffs against any nation that cheats by unfairly subsidizing their goods, of which many of them do. [applause]\nMy plan also includes a total renegotiation of NAFTA so our jobs can come back. [applause]\nAnd if we can't make a much, much better deal than we have right now, we will walk. [applause]\nI'm not in any way, shape or form an isolationist. I don't believe in it, but we have to make great deals for our country. We're losing in our whole trade negotiation with all countries over $800 billion a year. That's our trade deficit. Who negotiates these deals? We want great trade deals and we will have them. [applause]\nBut we want trade deals that work for America, that create jobs and wealth for our country, that work for the American worker. [applause]\nWe want to shrink our almost $800 billion trade deficit. We don't want to expand it, and it's been expanding for years. For years and years. You look at the charts up, up, up, up, up. And I say to myself so often, why don't they do something about it? And the reason is we have political hacks as our negotiators.\nWe have politicians as our negotiators. We have politicians that are controlled like Hillary Clinton by her donors, her special interests and her lobbyists and they won't let her do what's right for our workers and for our country.\nWe want to be leading the world in production, exports and manufacturing. We want jobs to leave from other countries and come into our country for a change. [applause]\nAnother major issue in this race is foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another. Beginning with the support for going to war in Iraq, and I opposed it so strongly.\nNobody cared. I was a civilian, but I opposed it. I said you will have a total destabilization of the Middle East. It was such common sense and look what happened. Her tenure as secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in United States history. But she is totally without remorse. Her failed decisions as secretary of State unleashed ISIS onto the world. [booing]\nBut has she ever apologized for the death and destruction she has caused? No.\nLook at the world before and after she became Secretary of State. Pre-Hillary in the early 2009s, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Libya was somewhat stable. Syria was under control. The group we now know today, ISIS, was close to being extinguished. Iran was being choked by sanctions.\nNow, take a look at what we have. Fast forward to the present time.\nAfter Hillary, here is what it looks like. Iraq is in total chaos. Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States, where we're taking in thousands and thousands and thousands of people. ISIS has been unleashed unto the entire world.\nIran, the world's top state sponsor of terrorism has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, was given $400 million in ransom payment cash [booing]\nVery much like you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan, Obamacare a total disaster. It will be repealed. It will be replaced. [applause]\nHillary Clinton is a legacy of death, destruction, and terrorism. America deserves a better legacy.\nAll of you deserve a much, much, better future.\nI am the change agent. I am the change agent. [applause]\nI am your messenger. And I said it many times, I'm nothing more than your messenger. It's a message of strong defense, common sense, take care of our vets, great education, get rid of Common Core, great health care, get rid of Obamacare, save our Second Amendment. [applause]\nWhich is under tremendous siege right now.\nHillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo or what we have. While our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time. Our country was losing. Our people were losing, but she is cashing in.\nBill Clinton's speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State. He was paid almost $50 million for speeches during her tenure, an increase in 44 percent over the previous four years.\nBy the way, things came out today that blow everything away today. Then there was all of the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations. It was pay for play. [booing]\nYet, Hillary Clinton, who is indifferent to the suffering she has caused, has no remorse at all. She offers no apologies. No apologies for unleashing ISIS. No apologies for her open borders. No apologies for lying about her e-mails or about Benghazi. [booing]\nThe only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 e-mails that she deleted.\nAnd the only way to get justice in this rigged system is to show up and vote on November 8th and vote big, big, big. [applause]\nAnd I will bring your jobs back. So are you ready to vote?\nAnd what about your future? Is it going to be great, good, or terrible?\nGreat. So if you're ready to vote for honest government and the honest government that you deserve, a Trump administration will end the corruption and restore integrity to government service. Remember, I'm funding my campaign, I'm spending tremendous amounts of money on running for office.\nI'm raising money for the Republican Party and the Republican National Committee, which I think is doing a very good job, but I'll tell you more about that on November 8th. I'll let you know if they do a good job or if they do not such a good job. But I think they're going to do a great job.\nNo one will be above the law in a Trump administration. The State Department will work for the country, not for Hillary Clinton's donors. [applause]\nAnd I will work for you and I will work for no one else. I will work for you. I will never lie to you. I will never put any other interests before you and I will never, ever stop fighting for you. Never. [applause]\nThe government will work for the people again. That means we are only going to admit individuals into our country who support our values and we're not going to issue visas where adequate screening controls take place. We are going to make sure that we have total screening, and without it, we cannot continue to have our government run like this. We will also seek to join in partnership with any nation that wishes to join us in defeating and destroying ISIS. [applause]\nAt home, taxes will go down, especially for look, I mean, it's going to go down for a lot of people, for business they're going down, businesses are going to flourish, they're going to come pouring back. But taxes will go down, especially for middle-income Americans. [applause]\nAnd small business rates will be lowered to 15 percent so we can put millions of new jobs into our poorest neighborhoods. [applause]\nAs I said, Obamacare will be repealed and replaced. Voters, not special interests, will be in charge finally. We are going to bring our country together again. We have a divided country. It's totally divided. The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity, total unity. We will love each other. We will have one county. Everybody will work together. [applause]\nWe are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. It's time to break with the failures of the past and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve. [applause]\nIn my administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people. [applause]\nThis is the change I am promising to all of you; an honest government with low taxes, a thriving economy and a just society for each and every American. It's time to vote for a new American future. [applause]\nTogether, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America united again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. God bless you. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you very much, Michigan. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-08-19", "title": "Remarks at the Summit Sports and Ice Complex in Dimondale, Michigan"}

This week, we recognize the important role played by the families, employers, and communities of these men and women in ensuring they can step forward and serve our country when they are needed most.\nThere are more than one million members of our National Guard and Reserve. Throughout the year, they dutifully train and prepare so that when they are called at a moment's notice to serve their Nation, they are able to serve with the honor and dedication that have long been hallmarks of our Armed Forces. Balancing their lives as civilians with their responsibilities in uniform, they defend and protect our people at home and abroad. In the face of natural disasters and humanitarian crises, they are quick to respond and offer assistance; during periods of conflict and strife, they help keep us safe and protect our national interests.\nThese citizen-Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen deserve the full backing of their civilian employers and the promise of a secure and stable life here at home. From the businesses that seek to recruit and retain these patriots in the workplace to the supporters who provide leadership and resources, this unconditional care for our Guardsmen and Reservists and their families is part of what makes our military the greatest fighting force the world has ever known.\nAmericans who volunteer to serve their country should always be able to partake in its opportunities. First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden's Joining Forces initiative has worked to make it easier for military spouses and veterans to find employment and ensure they are supported in the workforce. And my Administration has worked across all sectors to encourage communities to hire veterans and match members of the Guard and Reserve to the jobs they deserve. We must never waver in our commitment to fight for those who have fought for us, and we must continue striving to connect each of them with opportunities to keep their families strong and our country competitive.\nDuring National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, let us honor the members of our Guard and Reserve for their steadfast dedication to us all—both in and out of uniform. And let us acknowledge the families, employers, and businesses whose encouragement and flexibility have enabled our military to thrive, and whose support has been vital to the success, stability, and security of our Nation.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 21 through August 27, 2016, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. I call upon all Americans to join me in expressing our heartfelt thanks to the members of the National Guard and Reserve and their civilian employers. I also call on State and local officials, private organizations, and all military commanders to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-08-19", "title": "Proclamation 9474—National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2016"}

Earlier this summer, Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and I headed west to the national parks at Carlsbad Caverns and Yosemite. And I've got to say, it was a breath of fresh air. We explored hundreds of feet of underground, standing beneath dripping stalactites in New Mexico. We hiked up a misty trail next to a waterfall in California. And I even took a few pictures of my own, which I thought were pretty good.\nBut the truth is, no camera—especially one with me behind it—can fully capture the beauty and majesty of America's national parks. From Glacier and Denali to Gettysburg and Seneca Falls, our more than 400 parks and other sites capture our history and our sense of wonder. As FDR once said: \"There is nothing so American as our national parks. . . . The fundamental idea behind the parks . . . is that the country belongs to the people.\"\nThis month, we're celebrating the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service. And I want to encourage all of you to \"Find Your Park\" so that you and your family can experience these sacred places too. If you're a military family, you can even get in free through Michelle and Jill Biden's Joining Forces initiative. And if you've got a fourth grader in your family, you can get a free pass too, by going to everykidinapark.org.\nI hope you do. Because all across the country, the National Park Service is preparing for a big year. We're revitalizing a grove of giant Sequoias in Yosemite, repairing the Lincoln Memorial, and enhancing the iconic entrance to our first national park at Yellowstone.\nAs President, I'm proud to have built upon America's tradition of conservation. We've protected more than 265 million acres of public lands and waters, more than any administration in history. We've recovered endangered wildlife species and restored vulnerable ecosystems. We've designated new monuments to Cesar Chavez in California and Pullman porters in Chicago and the folks who stood up for equality at Stonewall in New York to better reflect the full history of our Nation. And we've got more work to do to preserve our lands, culture, and history. So we're not done yet.\nAs we look ahead, the threat of climate change means that protecting our public lands and waters is more important than ever. Rising temperatures could mean no more glaciers in Glacier National Park, no more Joshua trees in Joshua Tree National Park. Rising seas could destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades, even threaten Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty.\nSo, in the coming years and decades, we have to have the foresight and the faith in our future to do what it takes to protect our parks and protect our planet for generations to come. Because these parks belong to all of us. And they're worth celebrating, not just this year, but every year.\nThanks, everybody. Have a great weekend. And see you in the parks.", "timestamp": "2016-08-20", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

It's very detail, then we explain– do you know that Dwight Eisenhower who is a nice general, in the 1950s, do you know that he moved over a million people out and what he did, he brought them to the border and they came right back. Brought them to the boarder, and they came right back. Then what they did is they took them and moved them all the way down south and they never came back.

But last week, the administration acknowledged that the payment was contingent on the release of the prisoners. So I wanted to ask whether there is a shift in the way this is being explained, and has the administration been adequately forthcoming in explaining the scenario adequately?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, we've been quite direct since January, when the President announced this deal shortly after consummating it, exactly what the benefits would be for the United States. And the benefits that we have described have been verified and made public based on what exactly transpired. So those benefits are significant. Those benefits include preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, rolling back key aspects of their nuclear program. That was the nuclear track of negotiations that were completed -- that were read and completed by Secretary of State John Kerry.\nThat was a significant accomplishment. Many of our allies around the world had identified Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon as their most significant foreign policy concern. On a separate track, we completed negotiations to resolve a three-decade-old financial dispute between the United States and Iran in a way that saves taxpayers potentially billions of dollars. And on a separate, third track of negotiations, the United States succeeded in executing a mutual prisoner release that allowed four Americans who were being unjustly detained in Iran to come home.\nAll of this was accomplished without a single shot being fired. All of this was accomplished without U.S. troops being deployed. And it's an indication of how effective the President's tough diplomatic strategy has proved to be.\nQ: Was the President aware that senior Justice Department officials at that time were objecting to the sending of cash at the same time as the four imprisoned Americans were to be released?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I think you won't be surprised to hear that I'm not going to get into a lot of the discussions. But what I can tell you is that the President, of course, discussed these arrangements with members of his national security team and there was unanimous agreement among his national security team that he should move forward because of the many benefits that I've just described in terms of preventing them from obtaining a nuclear weapon, in terms of rolling back key aspects of their nuclear program, in terms of reaching a financial settlement that saved American citizens potentially billions of dollars, and in terms of securing the release of Americans who had been unjustly detained in Iran.\nAnd I think there is an on-the-record statement from the President's Attorney General indicating her strong support for moving forward with this arrangement.\nQ: In regard to the President's trip to Baton Rouge, did the White House schedule the trip in response to Donald Trump's visit?\nMR. EARNEST: Of course not.\nQ: The local paper has said the President is \"already late to this crisis, but it's better late than never.\" Has the President been tardy in responding more personally to Baton Rouge's floods?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I can tell you what the President has been focused on, is the response on the ground and the people whose lives in Louisiana have been turned upside down by this terrible flooding event. And the response that you've seen from the federal government has been effective. And the President and the other members of his team that have operational responsibilities have been effective.\nAnd, again, you don't just have to take my word for it. I would actually refer you to local officials in Louisiana who have said very positive things about the federal response -- including Republicans, including the highest-ranking Republican in Louisiana who has built his political career as far as I can tell on colorfully criticizing the administration. I'm referring, of course, to Billy Nungesser, the Lieutenant Governor of the state of Louisiana, the highest-ranking Republican official in the state. And his response was, when asked about this just a couple of days ago, he said, \"It's always nice to have the President visit as long as the team here on the ground is working closely with the local elected officials and the governor and getting the job done. That's what we are worried about.\"\nThat's what the President is worried about, too. That's why he sent his FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, down to Louisiana last week to see the damage firsthand. That's why the President sent his Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, down to Louisiana to see the damage firsthand. That's why the President was on the phone with the Governor of Louisiana eight days ago to talk to him directly about how his state was being affected by the flooding. And that's why in that phone call, the President informed the Governor that he was prepared to issue a disaster declaration to ensure that all available federal resources were being mobilized to support the local recovery efforts.\nSo I think the effectiveness of the response thus far speaks for itself. And I think, frankly, it's the most effective way to answer any of the politically motivated criticism that the President has faced.\nAyesha.\nQ: So a U.S. judge granted a nationwide injunction against the administration's bathroom policy for transgender students. I wanted to know, what's your response to this ruling? Was it a surprise? What are the next steps?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I will refer you to the Department of Justice about next steps. You will recall that this stems from guidance that the Department of Education had issued earlier this year that was in response to questions that they were getting from community groups and school districts all across the country. And the effort that was undertaken by the Department of Education was to collect best practices, to understand the experience of other school districts and individual schools that implemented policies to address this particular issue.\nAnd this guidance was issued, again, in response to these requests for information and the request for advice, and the primary goal in offering this guidance was to ensure a safe educational environment for all students. That I think was the motivation of the vast majority of administrators who were seeking this guidance, and it certainly was the primary goal of the administrators at the Department of Education who were seeking to be responsive to that request for information.\nIt certainly was not a mandate and was never described as such by the administration. I know it was described that way by some of our critics. But, look, I recognize that there are people who are eager to play politics with an issue like this just a few months before a national election, but the focus of the administration has been on practical problem-solving. And we have worked effectively with local school districts across the country to try to help them address this complicated issue. But our goal has been from the beginning to provide for the safety and security and dignity of students all across the country.\nSo I guess the point is we've got a lot of confidence in the guidance that was put forward. We certainly have confidence in the legal basis for issuing that guidance. But obviously we're respectful of rulings that are put forward by federal judges, and I'll let my colleagues at the Department of Justice speak to the next step in the legal process.\nQ: Vice President Biden is going to be visiting Turkey this week. I was wondering, what is going to be his message to the Turkish government? And there are more and more, I guess concerns being raised from Turkish officials that the cleric is not extradited that there will be a rise in anti-American sentiment and that basically extradition is going to deal with that in Turkey. Do you have any concerns about that? And what will be the Vice President's message on that issue?\nMR. EARNEST: First and foremost, the Vice President's message will be to indicate our continued, ongoing support for our allies in Turkey. It's a country that obviously is going through a lot. This is a country that was subject to a failed coup attempt earlier this summer. That is a coup attempt that was roundly and publicly condemned by the United States government. And we continue to strongly support the democratic government of our allies in Turkey. And there's been no ambiguity about that. And that is something that Vice President Biden will reiterate on his trip to Turkey.\nYou certainly can also expect to hear the Vice President indicate his support for and appreciation for the steps that Turkey has taken to make contributions to our counter-ISIL effort. There are a variety of ways in which their actions have benefitted the United States and the other members of our coalition, including additional efforts to secure the border between Turkey and Syria, and giving the United States and some of our coalition partners access to military facilities inside of Turkey.\nAs it relates to Mr. Gьlen, the individual that's in the United States that is obviously the subject of some concern that's been expressed by -- to put it mildly -- by the Turkish government. Vice President Biden will, if asked, will say to his counterparts what President Obama has communicated directly to President Erdogan, which is that there is a treaty, an extradition treaty, that's been on the books between the United States and Turkey for more than 30 years. And the United States is committed to following the procedure and guidelines that are outlined in that treaty.\nAnd you've already seen extensive coordination between officials at the Department of Justice and their Turkish counterparts. I understand that some Department of Justice officials are actually traveling to Turkey this week to meet with their counterparts to review some of the materials that have been produced by Turkish officials. But ultimately, this decision about extradition -- it's not a presidential decision. There is a process that is codified in that treaty and in U.S. law that we'll follow. And that's why U.S. Department of Justice officials are involved, and they certainly are going to do the due diligence that's required to follow that process, to follow those guidelines and to arrive at a conclusion. But it will be guided by the evidence and it will be guided by the rules and procedures that are codified in the extradition treaty and in United States law.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On the $400 million agreement, did the President know and agree that the payment should be used as leverage to ensure that the Americans would be released, that the money should not be released until we had confirmed that the Americans had been sent back?\nMR. EARNEST: Toluse, the approach to this from, again, as we described this in January, has been that there was an opportunity for the United States to make progress on a variety of issues that had been a longstanding source of concern between the United States and Iran. And because of our success in completing that three different set of negotiations, the American people benefitted and our interests were advanced.\nSo we do now stand here, six months later, seven months later, at a place where Iran is not able to obtain nuclear weapons, where Iran has made significant commitments to roll back key aspects of their nuclear program, where Iran has agreed to cooperate with intrusive inspection measures to verify their compliance with the agreement. Iran did agree to settle a longstanding financial dispute between our two countries in a way that saved American taxpayers potentially billions of dollars. And there are now four American citizens who have been freed from unjust detention in Iran. And that's good news.\nSo that is the way that we have described this from the beginning. And the President himself made this announcement to all of you in the Roosevelt Room *Cabinet Room of the White House. So our story on this and the way that we have described what our goals are have not changed. The benefits of this agreement have not changed.\nAnd look, I understand that there are right-wingers in Iran and right-wingers in the United States that would love to try to sully this agreement for their own political motivations. They were doing that before this agreement was reached. They were trying to prevent the nuclear agreement from moving forward. So it's not particularly surprising to me that they're now trying to criticize all of the engagement between the United States and Iran. They have their own political motive -- that's been well identified. You all have written about it.\nSo the criticism to me is not particularly surprising, but it also has not changed the motivation for making this deal. It has not changed the goals that we have laid out. And, frankly, it has not changed the benefits that the United States has enjoyed as a result of the tough diplomatic strategy implemented by the Obama administration.\nQ: Back on August 3rd, you were asked sort of about the coincidental timing that all of these things seemed to happen all over the same weekend -- the money being flown to Iran, the prisoners being released. And you said, in part, that it was because the Iranians were eager to have this money after 35 years and of this dispute being settled.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sure they were, but let me -- what I also did on August 3rd was I contested the notion that I ever described this as a coincidence. I never did. So I recognize that other people have raised that prospect. I'm not really sure why. I've never made the case that this was somehow a coincidence. What we sought to do was to try to reach these agreements, to get them done, to move it across the finish line. And clearly, Iran was in the business of signing off on agreements, so we were going to go and get as much as we could out of the deal.\nAnd what did we get? We got Iran committing to not getting nuclear weapons. We got Iran committing to rolling back their nuclear program. We got Iran to release Americans who were unjustly detained in Iran, and we got Iran to settle a longstanding dispute between our two countries that saved American taxpayers potentially billions of dollars. So the benefits are clear.\nQ: Right, but you never acknowledged at that point that this money was being used as leverage, and that the money would not be sent to Iran if the Americans were not released. So I think that's what's new that's come out since the last time we spoke about this. So I'm wondering, did you decide not to be as transparent as you could have been when you were given the opportunity to describe why these things happened around the same time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I described is the reason they happened around the same time is because Iran was in the business of signing off on agreements and so we were pushing the envelope to get as much as we possibly could. And, again, I've chronicled several times here the significant benefits that the United States enjoyed as a result of our tough, principled diplomacy.\nAnd the fact of the matter is those benefits are not in dispute. Even the toughest critics of this engagement aren't arguing here on the merits. So, again -- and the other part about this, Toluse, is nobody has changed their mind. I'm disappointed that there are previous critics of the agreement that haven't come around to acknowledging the fact of these benefits, but I understand that they're under some political pressure. And right-wingers in the United States and right-wingers in Iran can't be in a position of complimenting something that President Obama does. I understand that. They have their own political motivations. But what's also true, Toluse, is that the people who have supported this engagement with Iran and the benefits that we have enjoyed since have continued to support it.\nSo our story, since January, about what we did, why we did it, and what we got out of the deal has been consistent. And there's a good reason for that. Because the benefits are significant. Because the benefits are such that it's hard to quibble with the success of this engagement because the benefits are so significant. And all that was achieved without the firing of a single shot, without the deployment of a single soldier to ensure that we could get it done.\nQ: One more question about Syria. I'm wondering, has the President seen those images of the five-year-old boy who was pulled out of the rubble? And does he have any reaction to those images? And I think today marks six months since the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities. Does that cessation in the President's mind still hold or has it been completely broken at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I haven't spoken to the President about the image of that young boy in Syria, but it's difficult to spend much time looking at that image without being shaken by it. It's an arresting image and one that does document the terrible daily tragedy of life inside of Syria. It's heartbreaking. It's difficult to imagine what that five-year-old boy has seen in his short life, but it's deeply troubling to anybody with a conscience.\nIt's why the President and his team have invested so much time and energy to trying to bring an end to the violence inside of Syria. And as heartbreaking as that situation is, there's no military solution. In fact, I think that image, in some ways, is a testament to the fact that continued military action along the lines of the indiscriminate bombings carried out by the Syrian regime and aided and abetted by their allies like Syria -- I'm sorry -- like Russia and Iran is actually making the situation worse. And that's been communicated quite directly at very senior levels by American officials to their Russian counterparts.\nAnd we were pleasantly surprised six months ago when the Cessation of Hostilities first went into effect that it did have a greater-than-expected impact in reducing the violence in Syria. But we have obviously seen that Cessation of Hostilities fray significantly in some key areas of the country. It hasn't frayed everywhere, but in some key areas, including in Aleppo, we've been deeply concerned about that.\nAnd we've made the case to the Russians directly that continuing to support the Syrian regime as they carry out this kind of indiscriminate military activity only deepens the chaos inside of Syria. It only exacerbates the violence in that country. And it exacerbates the kind of tensions that fuel extremists, which is why it's just hard to believe that Russia has a sound strategy for going after extremists when so much of their strategy rests on carrying out and supporting the kinds of activities that only fuel that extremism.\nSo this has been an inherent contradiction in the Russian approach to Syria from the beginning and one that I pointed out from this podium on many occasions. And we're going to continue to make the case to the Russians that their strategy needs to change.\nMichelle.\nQ: I know you've had a lot to say about the benefits of the Iran nuclear deal and, yeah, the way you've described those benefits hasn't changed. But when we talk about how this was portrayed, do you see that we wouldn't even be having this conversation still if some of the details that have come out over the last few weeks had been put out there as they were put out there back in January? And I'm still not clear on why these details weren't put out then, because it seems like if the administration had said, yes, there were $400 million in cash on the plane at the same time, here's why it came out at the same time, here's when it was paid -- it wasn't paid before, it was paid exactly after, here's why. And had you used the word \"leverage\" then, I mean, that's why we're having this conversation. So can you be more clear on why those details weren't put out there in the same way now? Because I think it appears to a lot of people, and not just right-wingers, as you describe, that this detail is only being brought out because of details that came out in the press.\nMR. EARNEST: I guess the point that I would make, though, Michelle, is simply that the details that you have referred to, while potentially interesting to some, don't change the facts. They don't change the benefits. They don't change the goals that President Obama discussed when he announced this series of agreements back in January.\nQ: Surely you would rather not be having this conversation repeatedly. I mean, both -- you seem annoyed by it. When the President was asked about it, he seem annoyed that it was even coming up, almost as if you don't understand why it's coming up. So we're laying out exactly why it's coming up.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm happy to spend all the time that you would like talking about the details of the Iran agreement. I think that we're quite proud of all the benefits that we've enjoyed because of the President's tough, principled diplomacy. So the fact that we're talking about it seven months later I'm happy to do. We've got a strong case to make about what it is that we've done.\nQ: But the question is why -- as I said, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation if the word \"leverage\" was used and described as it was back then; if the timing and more of the details surrounding the timing was described better. So why not --\nMR. EARNEST: I quibble with you on the timing thing, because the President made clear -- the President himself announced this agreement within hours of it being completed and indicated exactly what the terms of these series of agreements would be. So back then, back in mid-January, all of you knew that there were two agreements that were completed roughly around the same time that would secure the release of unjustly detained Americans in Iran in exchange for the release of individuals who were being detained here in the United States, and you knew that that was taking place around the same place, within the same day, as the resolution of a financial settlement that potentially saved American taxpayers billions of dollars.\nSo I don't think I'm willing to accept the premise of your question about the timing because I think you were working that Sunday in January and were aware that this stuff was happening at the same time.\nQ: I think the details, though, put more interest on how unusual it was. So --\nMR. EARNEST: Let me be clear with you on that -- and I'll be quick here so we can get back to your question. But this is the thing. My colleagues at the State Department have indicated that there's actually not anything particularly unusual about the mechanism for this transaction, that these kinds of transactions between central banks are -- I don't know if they are common, but they're not unusual, at least in terms of the movement of currency.\nAnd again, the reason why -- I know that some of my -- well, some Republicans have made irresponsible and kind of outlandish comments about these, like, 500 Euro notes being part of the transfer. The reason that paper currency was used to make the transfer is because there's no banking relationship between the United States and Iran. So it's because of our commitment to ensuring the isolation of Iran that the transaction was carried out in this way.\nSo, again, there are other people who are much better experts on the way these kinds of transactions have taken place in the past, but my understanding is that this is not particularly unusual.\nQ: To avoid the scrutiny that's come out now twice since January, wouldn't it have been better to lay out the details that you've now since laid out back then, and why didn't you, including the use of the word \"leverage\"?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the President spoke publicly on live national television laying out the terms of this agreement. And there are any number of conversations that all of you had on the record and on background with senior administration officials describing what had happened.\nHere's the other thing that I would --\nQ: But we never heard the word \"leverage\" until a few days ago.\nMR. EARNEST: There are so many details that were included in what we're extraordinarily complex agreements. That all of the questions that all of you were raising back on the long holiday weekend in January were questions about how the Iran nuclear program was going to be monitored, what specific steps and how we knew what steps Iran was going to take to roll back key aspects of their nuclear program. All of you were asking about the condition of the U.S. citizens that were being unjustly detained and what exactly were the mechanisms for returning them to the United States. Those were all good questions, all of which were answered. So I --\nQ: The fact that the money needed to be -- that it was seen as available to be used as leverage to make sure that the prisoners were returned -- why was that never described then until just a few days ago?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, Michelle, I can't go back through all of the questions that all of you have asked, but, again, the President was very clear about what exactly had been agreed to. And I did briefings subsequent to the President's announcement and was quite clear about what exactly had been agreed to. And we spent a lot of time talking about the significant benefits that the United States enjoyed as a result of this tough diplomacy.\nQ: Russia having used Iranian airbases, or at least one Iranian airbase, and now stopping it -- what's the administration's reaction to that? And how does that affect the potential of working with Russia against Al-Nusra down the road?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I did note that there was a statement from a senior Iranian official indicating that the Russian use of Iranian military facilities was not likely to -- or had at least stopped for now. But, look, Michelle, you guys have reported on a variety of occasions that both Russia and Iran are propping up the Assad regime. And for years, at this point, the President, the Secretary of State, other senior U.S. officials, even me in the setting of this briefing, have made the point that Russia deepening itself, deepening its involvement in the sectarian conflict in Syria is counterproductive because it only deepens the chaos inside of Syria, it sets a much needed political settlement further away. This is a political settlement, a political transition that the Russians themselves acknowledge is necessary to resolve the situation inside of Syria. It also only fuels the extremism that's taken root inside of Syria.\nSo the revelation that -- and I use that term somewhat derisively -- should not be particularly surprising to those who have been following the situation closely because we very long described our concerns with the actions of the Russians and the Iranians working together to prop up the Assad regime. It's counterproductive. It's counterproductive for the goals of the Russians, it's counterproductive for the goals of the United States, and it's counterproductive for the goals of the world that is feeling the negative consequences of the chaos inside of Syria.\nMike.\nQ: If we can go back to the flooding in Louisiana. I believe the height of Katrina took place a week from today 11 years ago. So Louisiana is deeply fraught when it comes to Presidents and disasters. I'm wondering if the President and his team talked at all about any special considerations for how he and the administration should approach the flooding in Baton Rouge given the history in Louisiana with flooding, and whether any decisions were made differently or whether, going forward, there's any special attention that the President believes the United States government owes to that state given the history. And any differences that you see between -- similarities or differences between this incident and the response to Katrina.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the first thing that is true -- and this is something that Louisiana officials in both parties have observed -- is that the federal response to this flooding has been much more effective and much more impactful than the initial FEMA response to Hurricane Katrina. And I think that is a testament to the efforts of people like Craig Fugate, President Obama's FEMA Administrator, to professionalize that agency. And Director Fugate has brought his expertise and extensive skills to that job in a way that's transformed the agency and learned from the painful lessons of Katrina. And I think you have seen a federal response that's much more effective as a result.\nWhat's also true is that the relationship between emergency response officials in Louisiana and federal officials is quite strong, and in some ways, that is a vestige of Hurricane Katrina, but certainly one that the people of Louisiana benefit from. I can also tell you that that's the lesson I think most people take away from Katrina -- is a focus on the results and to focus on what steps the federal government can take to support the state and local officials who have the primary responsibility for responding to disastrous situations like this.\nAnd there's all too common temptation to focus on the politics and to focus on the optics. But the survivors of the flooding in Louisiana are not well served by a political discussion. They're well served by a competent, effective, strong, coordinated government response. And the federal government has certainly done our part in the first eight to 10 days after this disaster, but there's a long road ahead, and I know that Director Fugate and Secretary Johnson and certainly President Obama understands that the response and recovery effort is something that's going to extend well into the future -- particularly in the aftermath of an event this widespread.\nSo that's part of the message that President Obama will take to Louisiana, which is, after the political discussions have died down and after the television cameras have left, the United States government and the American people are going to be standing with the people of Baton Rouge as they rebuild their community, as they rebuild their city, and come back stronger than ever.\nStephanie.\nQ: In the wake of the recent shootings in -- shooting incidents in Chicago over the weekend, how much of an interest does President Obama take in the shooting in his hometown? Has he been in touch with Mayor Emanuel this month? And does he plan on speaking out about the gun violence there?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific conversations between President Obama and Mayor Emanuel about the recent gun violence in Chicago. But I think on the unfortunately many occasions that you've heard President Obama talk about the problem of gun violence in the United States, the President has noted the tendency to focus on mass shooting events, and for good reason. The loss of life that we've seen in places like Baton Rouge and Orlando quickly captures people's attention. But it's important not to overlook the kind of violence that, unfortunately, we see every day and every night in cities like Chicago. And the President often cites the experience of his hometown in making those kinds of comments -- that the steps that we can take to prevent gun violence -- common-sense steps that don't undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans -- wouldn't just make mass shooting incidents less likely, they might also have a positive impact on our efforts to fight more common spates of gun violence, like the shootings in Chicago that you referred to over the weekend.\nQ: And we've heard from Colin Powell, how he denies inspiring Hillary Clinton's private email server use. Does President Obama think it's fair for him to say Hillary Clinton's \"people\" are trying to pin her reliance on a private email server on him?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, like the President, I don't have any insight into any sort of conversations that may have taken place between Secretary Clinton and General Powell, so I'm afraid I can't shed much light on that for you.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, when you say the criticism of President Obama's response to Baton Rouge has been politically motivated, might the same be said of candidate Obama's criticism of President Bush in 2008 when he was critical of President Bush flying over New Orleans after cutting short his vacation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Mark, you've presented a very apt illustration of a focus on optics over response. And I think certainly that infamous photo underscored the risks with that kind of approach. I think what's notable about Hurricane Katrina, Mark, is that there were Democrats and Republicans in Louisiana who were critical of the federal government's response in the immediate aftermath of the storm. And I think the failures of that response have been well-documented. What's notable about this situation, what's different about this situation is that in response to this flood, you've got Democrats and Republicans in Louisiana praising the federal response. And I think that's the most significant difference.\nQ: But President Bush was criticized by candidate Obama for flying over -- for not being on the ground quicker in New Orleans when he actually was on the ground within five days, which is faster than President Obama's response or visit.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I guess what I would say is -- I can't speak to the comments that President -- or then candidate Obama may have made in 2008. What President Obama has demonstrated as President of the United States is a commitment to focusing on results and focusing on the response and focusing on the competence and professionalism at FEMA. That has been his priority.\nAnd, again, I recognize that there are some who are going to criticize the optics of the President making that the priority. The President is willing to assume that criticism as long as the federal response is up to par. And we've been pleased that, thus far, that's what's happened.\nBut that didn't happen by accident. That only happens because there are patriotic Americans serving at FEMA who are working around the clock to try and meet the needs of Americans in Baton Rouge who are facing the worst day or week of their lives. And it only happens because you have leading officials in the U.S. government, including the President of the United States, that have made clear that effective emergency management and emergency response is going to be a top priority. And that's why he installed an expert like Craig Fugate to run that agency.\nAnd, look, Director Fugate deserves an enormous amount of credit for retooling that agency, for overhauling it, and strengthening the relationship between FEMA and state and local officials all across the country. And, again, Mr. Fugate is not somebody who gets a lot of TV time other than in disasters. And the fact that he is somebody who is so closely associated with effective management and effective emergency response I think is a testament to his prodigious skill.\nQ: It sounds like you're saying, \"heck of a job, Craig Fugate.\"\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it sounds like Lieutenant Governor Billy Nungesser -- a colorful, noted Obama critic, and the highest-ranking Republican official in Louisiana -- is saying that FEMA and Administrator Fugate have done an excellent job in supporting the people of Louisiana in their time of need.\nQ: On one other issue, in the transfer of detainees last week from Gitmo, did President Obama play any role in requesting the UAE to accept those detainees?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you, Mark, is that the diplomatic agreements that are reached with other countries who agree to take Gitmo detainees is work-intensive. I think it's pretty obvious that there's not a lot of immediate upside to agreeing to bear responsibility for these individuals, if for no other reason than just the stigma associated with them. So I can't speak to any specific conversations that President Obama had with senior officials in the UAE, but I can tell you that in other discussions with world leaders, the President has talked about how much the United States appreciates the support and friendship we've received from other countries who have agreed to bear this responsibility so that we could make progress in closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nQ: Is it still his intention to empty out Gitmo before the end of his term?\nMR. EARNEST: The President is still aiming to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay by the end of his term.\nBill.\nQ: Since you're speaking of optics, was any consideration given to suggesting that the President perhaps not play golf on the same day that the Republican candidate was going to Louisiana?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of.\nQ: Why not?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, because the President was focused on the federal response. And that's why, just days after this flooding started, the President was on the phone with the Governor of Louisiana to talk to him about what support the U.S. government could provide. And that's why the President informed him in that phone call that he was prepared to issue a disaster declaration. And that's why days later, the President sent his FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, down to see the damage firsthand, and just a day or two after that, the President sent his DHS Secretary down to Louisiana to see the damage firsthand. And after each of those visits, the President got a phone call from each of them reporting back to him directly, firsthand, exactly what they had seen.\nSo the President has been focused on the response and not, frankly, as concerned with the optics, as all of you appear to be.\nQ: But you seemed to acknowledge earlier that the optics do have a -- they matter.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, they matter in as much as there are plenty of critics of the Obama administration that seize on those optics because they can't, frankly, criticize the response, so they've got to find something to criticize the President about.\nQ: What will the President see when he goes down there tomorrow? Where is he going?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll have more details. This is obviously still coming together. As we noted on Friday -- as I noted in the statement on Friday, the President is seeking to organize this visit in a way that doesn't have an impact on the significant response and recovery efforts that are underway there in Louisiana. So I would anticipate the President will have an opportunity to see some of the damage firsthand. I would anticipate that the President will have the opportunity to speak to officials in Louisiana who have been managing the response effort, including the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. I would expect the President will have an opportunity to meet with and offer some comfort to citizens whose lives have been thrown into chaos as a result of this event. And I'm confident the President will take advantage of the opportunity to thank some of those who were responsible for saving lives at the height of this event.\nDoug.\nQ: Are you equating these two storms -- Katrina and the rainfall in Baton Rouge right now? Because one was of a scale much, much grander than anything we've seen here. One is caused by days and days of steady rain; the other was caused by a hurricane which devastated the entire Southeast United States, affecting millions and millions of people. Yet you said the federal government did a much more effective job with this most recent storm, which is fully understandable, given its scale.\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm saying is that it's Louisiana officials, both Democrats and Republicans, who are saying that the federal response to these floods in Baton Rouge have been much more effective than the federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. So I was citing their experience. And I think it's some of your colleagues who are noting that it's about the same time of year that these two events occurred.\nJust as a matter of science, I've seen some reporting on this that actually indicates that there was substantially more rainfall associated with this flooding event than was actually even part of Hurricane Katrina. Now, what was also included in Hurricane Katrina was a storm surge and wind damage that wreaked havoc on a large American city. But I think it's --\nQ: The broken levees was the primary cause.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, but I think it is -- I don't think it's fair to downplay the significance of this historic flooding event that's affecting not just Baton Rouge but other parts of southern and central Louisiana.\nQ: And then back to the $400 million payment. The rest of that money, the $1.3 billion that's remaining, has been paid -- is that my understanding?\nMR. EARNEST: That's my understanding.\nQ: And what was the form of the payment?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that this interest payment -- so just to go back, the $400 million payment was actually the principal. This was Iran's money. Back in 1979, they had deposited money into a U.S. account because they were hoping to buy military equipment. Of course, that military equipment was not provided to the Iranian regime because we'd just seen the government be overthrown there. So this is money, Iranian money that had been held in a U.S. account for 35 years. And so the $400 million was actually the return of that principal. And the financial dispute was rooted in how much interest we were going to have to pay. And the resolution of that dispute, by getting Iran to accept a $1.3 billion interest payment, in the eyes of experts, potentially saved U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars.\nSo that's the argument for why we made this settlement. But as it relates to the mechanics here, what I can tell you is that the $1.3 billion payment has been made. It was made through a transaction involving central banks, but obviously not the U.S. central bank because there are extensive restrictions on the financial relationship between the United States and Iran. So we had to work with partners, and out of respect for those partners, we're not going to disclose which partner it was. But this is the kind of central bank transaction that is, while probably not routine, not particularly uncommon.\nQ: And that raises my next question, because if you used central banks to make this most recent transaction, why did you not use them in the first transaction? And why did you not wire the money to a third party which did have a banking relationship with Iran?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the transfer of the $400 million was actually a central bank to central bank transaction. So that's why I went back at Michelle on the suggestion that somehow this was rather unusual. Again, I don't think it's common given the extraordinary circumstances here, but the mechanism for this transfer was also conducted from central bank to central bank.\nThere are significant limitations on our ability to engage in financial transactions with Iran because of all of the sanctions that the United States has put in place. Now, some of those sanctions have been rolled back because that was part of the nuclear agreement. So there is more flexibility in executing these kinds of transactions than existed when the $400 million payment was made. But the fact is, it's difficult to engage in any of these sort of financial transactions because of the remaining sanctions that are in place because of Iran's violation of human rights and support for terrorism and other things.\nQ: And you're aware that many of your congressional critics, right-wingers say that this form of payment, cash in Euros and Swiss Francs and other denominations, is precisely how Iran pays many of its terrorist proxies?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'd be surprised if they had much insight into how exactly Iran engages in these financial transactions with their proxies. If they do, maybe some of our intel analysts would like to talk to them. But what I can assure you of is that the financial agreement that we reached saved U.S. taxpayers potentially billions of dollars, and that's exactly why we reached this agreement.\nQ: Last question. You talked about the right-wingers. Admiral Kirby is no right-winger. He has offered a fundamentally different interpretation of this transaction, that it was connected to the release of these hostages. The President, in his last press conference before departing on his vacation, said the United States does not pay ransom. You've talked about the benefits of this exchange, but you have not talked about the detriments. And many of your critics say the detriment is that there is a bounty hanging over the heads of U.S. citizens who are being held by terrorists now.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, anybody who thinks that there is a bounty over U.S. citizens is being foolish in thinking so because the United States does not pay ransom. And the President said as much quite directly. That's been the policy of this administration; that was the policy of previous administrations, Democrats and Republicans. That is the policy that has come under some criticism by some who do think the United States should pay ransom because of the value that we place on human life. The President has reached the conclusion -- again, the same conclusion that was reached by Democratic and Republican predecessors of his -- that to pay a ransom only puts U.S. citizens in more danger. And that's why the United States won't pay a ransom even for Americans that are being unjustly detained overseas.\nI would point out that we do actually have a quite strong record of securing the release of Americans who have been unjustly detained overseas -- not just in Iran, but in other places around the world. And that is a process that this administration has overhauled to make even more effective, particularly as it relates to communicating with the families of those who are being held hostage. But this is something that -- this issue and securing the safe rescue and return of U.S. citizens being held against their will overseas is something that the President has made a priority, and we've made significant progress in improving that process.\nQ: One more question.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: It's widely interpreted that this is the homestretch for President Obama, between now and Election Day. What does he hope to accomplish over the course of the next three months or so? And given the impasse that he has with congressional Republicans, what alternatives does he have to exercise those options?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the fact that Congress hasn't done a whole lot during the first eight months of the year doesn't give us a lot of hope that they're going to get a lot done over the next two and a half months or so. And that's been a source of disappointment. In particular, it's been disappointing that while Congress is in the midst of a seven-week break, that there are Americans in some communities across the country that are dealing with the Zika virus being actively spread in their communities. And it's unfortunate that Congress skipped town for a seven-week recess without being focused on providing the resources that our public health professionals say are necessary to do everything possible to fight that virus.\nSo when members of Congress get back to work, we're hopeful that they'll make providing Zika-fighting resources available to public health professionals a top priority. They should have done that six months ago when the President and public health professionals first asked for the resources. And hopefully, they'll get to work when they get back. But, look, it's Republicans who have blocked the President's request.\nQ: And they say you're the ones who have blocked their request. They passed a bill with full funding for Zika treatment.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, actually what happened is that there was bipartisan support -- there were some Republicans that did come on board with the Senate bill that did get consideration that did include full funding. There was a compromise measure that some Republicans were able to pass through the House. A different version was passed through the Senate. But both of them were laden with a bunch of politically motivated riders that made clear that they weren't actually interested in passing funding to fight Zika, they were actually trying to make progress on an ideological agenda. And the fact that they would hold hostage Zika funding just so that they could limit funding Planned Parenthood, for example, is, frankly, embarrassing for Republicans who can't do their job.\nLet me add one more thing to this. I think the other thing that's been appalling is not just that Republicans went on a seven-week vacation without doing their job, they've actually spent their seven-week vacation bragging about not doing their job. So I don't know if all of you saw these comments from Leader McConnell. This is the highest-ranking Republican in the United States Senate who said, \"One of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.'\"\nIt takes a lot of nerve to take a seven-week vacation when you haven't been doing your job. But it takes an extra-special dose of nerve to brag about not doing your job during your seven-week vacation. I think we now have a pretty good illustration of why congressional Republicans are polling so low.\nQ: Last question. Do you know if the Zika funding -- is there enough money for funding the threat, which has diminished greatly since the height of that --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there has been money that has been transferred, but that money has been transferred from Ebola accounts because Congress hasn't provided sufficient funding so that we can fight Zika. And it does mean that even if there is a small risk from Ebola, why would we take that chance? Why would we be diverting our attention and resources that we know are needed for Ebola so that we can fight the Zika virus? The only reason that we have to do that is because Congress has utterly failed to do what's responsible and necessary to ensure that our public health professionals have everything that they need to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus.\nAnd so it is a source of significant disappointment that Congress hasn't acted responsibly. The truth is there are plenty of Republican representatives in Congress from states that are at risk from the Zika virus, and hopefully one of them is going to demonstrate some leadership and actually have some influence with the Republican leadership in the United States Congress and actually get this done.\nBut right now, there's a special onus on these Republican members of Congress from states like Florida and Georgia and Louisiana -- these are states where we know that the Zika virus is likely to spread -- Texas is among them, as well -- and those all have representatives in the Senate and the House who are Republicans. And I think the only way this is going to get done is them figuring out how they're going to be able to persuade the Republican leadership to let this through. And thus far, those Republican representatives from Florida and Georgia and Texas and other places have failed. And it's their citizens that they were elected to represent who are going to have to bear the cost of it.\nAnita.\nQ: In the last few weeks, President Obama is starting fundraising for Hillary Clinton's campaign, and as their practice, the White House press corps is able to come -- at least the pools, they were coming to hear his remarks. Hillary Clinton has not done that with her fundraisers, and I'm wondering if the President has a problem with that. I mean, at some point, they will probably appear together at a fundraiser. I don't think that has happened yet. Does the White House think that she should allow the press corps into hear what she's saying?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as you've heard me say many times over the last year or so from the podium, I'm going to let the campaigns make their own decisions about the best way to run their campaigns. None of them need any advice from me, and few of them would take any advice from me, frankly.\nQ: -- a problem that the White House press corps might be able to come into something and he might be saying something that the Hillary Clinton press corps can't come into the same event?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not sure there's ever been a situation where something like that has happened, and I'm not sure that it will.\nQ: -- at fundraisers for the next three months?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess -- again, the Clinton campaign will make their own decisions. What I will just observe is the President doesn't have any trouble attracting people to attend his fundraisers. Secretary Clinton doesn't either. So, again, maybe there will be a need at some point in the future for the two of them to appear together, but it's not one that I anticipate at this point.\nBut I can assure you that if President Obama is making formal public remarks at a fundraiser that we'll find a way to make sure that the pool has access to those remarks.\nQ: Let me ask you a similar question -- but in general, both candidates running for President are far less transparent than President Obama is right now, or was as a candidate, either time. And I'm just wondering --\nMR. EARNEST: I welcome you asking this question anytime in the next --\nQ: You've made a point of this all the time that it's the most transparent administration. Clearly, if Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton wins, clearly, if they're doing what they're doing now, it will be less transparent. Does that not bother this White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm just not going to --\nQ: -- for one candidate.\nMR. EARNEST: For a variety of reasons --\nQ: -- the question right now.\nMR. EARNEST: For a variety of reasons, I'm just not going to be in a position to offer campaign advice from the podium here. We're focused on the people's business. And at some point if there are questions about -- well, let me just say it this way. Each of the candidates is allowed to make their own case about what kind of value they place on transparency and what steps they're prepared to take to be transparent. And I certainly -- well, I'm just going to stop there. (Laughter.) I just --\nQ: I guess I would just say is the President of the United States has an influence with the party's nominee. He could use that influence, is all I'm saying. I don't expect an answer to that. But you have a question before you.\nMR. EARNEST: All I'm saying is each of the individual campaigns -- I'm quite limited in what I can say in this context about the individual campaigns. But I'm confident that if you contacted one of my colleagues at the Clinton campaign they would have a very strong, fact-based case to make about how much more transparent they are being than their opponent, particularly with regard to tax returns. But that is a case that I'll let them make. (Laughter.)\nWhat I will do is I will make an affirmative case about what President Obama has done to try to bring more transparency into the administration. And, yes, we have made the case repeatedly, in the face of some pretty withering criticism, about how -- I'm looking at you, Mark -- about how the Obama administration is the most transparent administration in history. It's also the job of all of you, including your colleague, Mark, here, to contest that notion and to press us for more access and to say that that's not enough. But President Obama has clearly made this a priority and he hopes that subsequent Presidents will, as well.\nQ: Okay. So the second question on a separate topic -- in the last few weeks, including today, emails have been released from a variety of places showing -- these are either Hillary Clinton emails or aides' emails -- showing that the Clinton Foundation executive director officials sought and in some cases received special access at the State Department. And I'm wondering, if this -- because of the agreement that the White House struck with the Clinton State Department, if you all have problems with that. If it didn't violate the actual lines of the agreement, many people have said it violates the spirit of the agreement. And I'm wondering what your thoughts are.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm actually not going to get into that. There is an agreement that was in place while Secretary Clinton was at the State Department that did go above and beyond standard ethics requirements, including as it relates to the Clinton family foundation. But for emails that were exchanged between State Department officials and individuals at the foundation --\nQ: It's your State Department, though.\nMR. EARNEST: I understand that. But the responsibility for enforcing the ethical guidelines that are included in the memorandum of understanding falls with ethics attorneys at the State Department. This is how it works at every agency. So I'm going to let State Department officials talk about emails from the State Department. I'll let officials at the foundation talk about emails that their officials sent.\nGo ahead, Hans.\nQ: Earlier, you kind of suggested we weren't asking precise enough questions seven months ago on Iran and that's why some of the lack of clarity is here. So for the sake of clarity, could you describe for me and for the record the White House's understanding and the delineation between leverage and ransom?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Hans, I will be very clear about this. I was not trying to imply any sort of lack of effort or expertise on the part of the reporters who were asking questions. The observation that I'm making is that there are a whole lot of details related to this series of agreements. And the truth is the questions that you guys were asking about the safety and security of American citizens who were being released, about how we could verify the commitments that Iran was making with regard to their nuclear program, about the mechanism for releasing these American citizens and what prisoners were released in the United States in exchange for them -- all those were legitimate questions. And all those were answered in detail, including in some cases, on the record in the President's remarks to all of you; in other cases, particularly as it relates to the prisoners who were released, there were statements issued and information provided by the Department of Justice.\nSo I guess the point that I'm making here, Hans, is not just that there was a failure on the part of the press corps, just the observation that this was extraordinarily complex and there are lots of details that people were justifiably interested in. And I think understanding the details, the kinds of details that I just outlined I think would have an impact on people's appraisal of the benefits of the approach that we have pursued.\nThe point that I'm making is the kinds of details that we're talking about now, while might be interesting fodder for a read in a spy novel on the beach, don't change our assessment about what exactly was concluded and how the United States benefitted from the conclusion of this series of agreements.\nQ: I'll concede this is all very complex. But my simple question is, what's the difference between a ransom and leverage?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the point is simply this: The United States was pursuing three different agreements, trying to resolve three different issues with the Iranians. And the nuclear agreement was one that Secretary Kerry and others -- Ambassador Wendy Sherman among them -- spent years, many sleepless nights, trying to negotiate with the Iranians. And we completed that agreement. And that actually went into effect, Implementation Day was actually the day before the release of the American citizens, and the day before the completion of the financial settlement.\nWhat we have made clear is that the American citizens in Iran who were unjustly detained were released in exchange for the United States releasing some prisoners who were held here. These were individuals who were convicted of crimes like trying to circumvent sanctions that were in place against Iran --\nQ: -- the $400 million was the leverage.\nMR. EARNEST: The $400 million was a separate settlement.\nQ: Where does the timing in the leverage come in? Because the State Department has used the word, \"leverage.\" The President has used the word, \"ransom.\" And I'm just trying to square.\nMR. EARNEST: And I guess what I'm saying is that what we made clear to the Iranians is that we expected them to navigate the complexities of all of this. We were doing our part to release the seven prisoners. There are also 14 other individuals who had red notices against them dropped. They were part of this agreement to secure the release of the unjustly detained Americans.\nBut this is a complicated arrangement, and we expected them to keep their commitments.\nQ: -- ask another simple question. Is there a difference between a ransom and leverage?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Hans, I guess I quibble with this because --\nQ: Every time -- we've been sort of dinged for not asking precise questions. We're trying to ask them, and then we don't get direct answers. I mean, is this -- the President said no ransoms. The State Department said leverage was paid. So just how do we bring those two together? I mean, if there's no distinction, there's no distinction. But we're giving you a chance right now to say is there a distinction between ransom and leverage, and your quibbling with the question, which seems like a pretty basic question.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again -- well, first of all, I'm not dinging the press corps, and I certainly didn't mean to ding you or anybody else for not asking precise questions. As I mentioned earlier, the fact is this is extraordinarily complex.\nThe notion of a ransom I think I often perceived as paying money in exchange of the release of unjustly detained individuals. That's not what occurred here. What occurred here was a mutual prisoner release. Iran released four American citizens who were being unjustly detained in Iran, and we brought them home. The United States released seven individuals who had been convicted of crimes and were being held here in the United States. You've got to check on the details with the Justice Department. I don't know if all of them had been convicted, but at least several of them were being held here in U.S. prisons because they were either convicted of or accused of a crime. So that is the --\nQ: I heard the definition of ransom. The definition of leverage is?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's not a word that I'd use, I guess is what I would point out. So you can ask somebody else about that. But we've been quite clear exactly about what led to all of this.\nQ: Earlier you were quite clear that you were very proud of the entire agreement. Were you proud that leverage was used?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, that's a word that I have not used. And the point is we are quite proud of the benefits that have been enjoyed by the American people, and we are quite proud of the way that we have prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, convinced Iran to roll back key aspects of their nuclear program, cooperate with intrusive inspections of their nuclear facilities, secure the release of four unjustly detained Americans, and saved the American taxpayers potentially billions of dollars. And we've done all of that without firing a single bullet or deploying a single troop.\nQ: If \"leverage\" isn't the word you're comfortable using, how would you describe the delay in the timing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is clear is that the --\nQ: Just one word. If leverage doesn't work, ransom doesn't work, what works?\nMR. EARNEST: What works is that Iran released four American citizens who were being unjustly detained in exchange for seven individuals being released in the United States. That was the exchange. That's the direct exchange that occurred. This was a mutual prisoner release.\nQ: The mechanisms that were used, your words -- the arrangements -- how would you describe that arrangement?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think I just did. They released four people that were being unjustly detained in Iran and we brought them home. There were seven individuals that were being held in the United States and we released them. That's the mutual prisoner release.\nI think people have described this as a quid pro quo. That's the quid pro quo. They released four; we released seven.\nQ: One final -- you're not using the term, \"leverage.\" Do you disavow, do you want to walk back that leverage? Since leverage is not something you're comfortable coming from the White House.\nMR. EARNEST: What is clear, Hans, is this -- is that the United States was much more concerned about completing the agreement to bring our four unjustly detained American citizens home than we were in reaching the financial settlement. The Iranians might have had a different set of priorities. They may have valued that money more. You'd have to ask them.\nSo it's clear what our priority was in this instance when it came to those two transactions that were completed on the same day. But, again, the reason that we quibble with this notion of a ransom is pretty straightforward. The quid pro quo here was the release of four Americans by Iran in exchange for the release of seven prisoners in the United States.\nAlexis.\nQ: Josh, can we just add one question on top of what Hans was asking, and everybody was asking? Going forward, is the President concerned now that there is enough confusion about what you described as very complex that the perception in the United States and around the world is that the United States has a different policy in not paying ransoms and that this confusion might put Americans in harm's way in terms of making them susceptible to being detained, imprisoned, taken hostage in the future?\nMR. EARNEST: I would acknowledge and I have acknowledged -- I think we've all acknowledged that the situation is complex, but there should be no confusion. The President has been clear from the beginning of his presidency that the United States does not pay ransoms. And the President said as much a couple of weeks ago. He said it directly in response to a question. He said it live on television. And he said it straight -- you heard it straight from the President's mouth. That is the policy of the United States. That is the policy for which the United States has been criticized on occasion. That is the policy that was in place and followed by previous Presidents in both parties. But it's the policy that's been in place here in the United States.\nAs it relates to those individuals who were intentionally trying to sow confusion, it's unfortunate that they are seeking to do so, but I understand that they have a political motive for doing so. And I'm referring to political motives of right-wingers in Iran and right-wingers in the United States.\nAs the President himself, again, about a year or so ago, made the observation that right-wingers in Iran were making common cause with Republicans here in the United States. So this is not a new phenomenon. It's not different that the right-wingers in Iran are making basically the same argument as Republicans here in the United States. That's not new. But it's also not new that the President has been unambiguous about the policy that we've pursued in this administration not to pay ransom.\nQ: Can I ask a Louisiana question?\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: Is it too early to suggest that there might be a request for additional federal assistance that the President would need to work with Congress on? Has there been discussion inside the administration because of the high price tag that deals with schools, Education Department, Agriculture, obviously homes -- I was just wondering if it's too early to say that that might be a discussion here.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm certainly not aware of any discussions like that that have taken place thus far. But obviously the President is going to have an opportunity to go hear firsthand from officials in Louisiana when he visits there tomorrow. And certainly as we make more progress in the response and recovery it will become clearer what exactly the price tag is and clearer what sort of additional support the people of Louisiana and the state of Louisiana may need.\nSo the administration is committed to standing with Louisiana and the people of Louisiana in this difficult time. And, again, if the past is any guide, after several days here, the attention will trickle away, but this administration is going to be focused on standing with the people of Louisiana even after the television cameras have left. And that is a commitment that the President will make when he travels there tomorrow.\nQ: One other follow-up on Doug's question about the President's agenda moving forward. You mentioned Senator McConnell not being helpful on the Supreme Court. But Senator McConnell is in favor of trade. On TPP and the effort that the administration was making during the summer break to try to I guess gin up support for getting TPP ratification, is the President still of a mind that that is possible in a lame duck?\nMR. EARNEST: The President certainly continues to believe that the Congress should support the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The President and his team have negotiated a very effective deal, and this is an agreement that has been posted publicly for months that people around the world and the United States Congress have been able to read. And that agreement includes 18,000 tax cuts on American goods that other countries impose. It includes provisions that allow the United States to enforce higher labor standards and higher environmental standards, and even higher human rights standards in a variety of countries. And it also gives the United States and businesses here the opportunity to compete on a more level playing field in countries around the world, including some countries that are home to the fastest-growing economies in the world.\nAnd the President is concerned that if the United States doesn't engage in this way, that we're only leaving a vacuum for China to fill. We know that China is actually in touch with other countries who have signed on to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, trying to negotiate their own trade deals with them. There is a very real risk that the United States gets cut out of the deal. And the reason for that is simple. China is not looking for a higher standard when it comes to workers' rights or the environment or protecting intellectual property. If anything, they're looking to lower those standards that will only put the United States and our businesses and our economy and our workers at a bigger disadvantage.\nSo that's the challenge here and that's the case, frankly, that the President will be making to members of Congress. And he certainly will continue to be making that case until it gets done. And the President is certainly hopeful that it will get done before he leaves office.\nQ: Is there anything on his domestic schedule that will be related just specifically to that argument, to trade?\nMR. EARNEST: Nothing on his domestic schedule in terms of travel at this point to talk about, but we'll keep you posted.\nAndrew, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Turkey has reportedly taken artillery strikes against Islamic State and Kurdish targets in Northern Syria. And my first question on the strikes against the Islamic State group -- is Turkey doing this alone? Were you told about it? Is this something that's part of a coordinated effort within Operation Inherent Resolve? And secondly, there have been strikes against the PYD, which is linked to a U.S.-backed group. Is the White House -- does the White House have a problem with Turkey bombing your allies?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Andrew, I can tell you that I don't have any specific military operations to talk to you about. Let me say it this way -- I don't have any specific Turkish military operations to talk to you about. Our policy has been that we certainly stand with our allies, our NATO allies in Turkey as they confront terrorism. And they face terrorism from a variety of sources, including most recently and tragically, just over the weekend, where there was a bombing at a wedding, of all places, where dozens of innocent people were killed.\nSo the threat that Turkey faces from extremism and from terrorists is very real. And there are a variety of steps that the United States has taken to support our Turkish allies, and we've certainly offered additional support as they deal with specific incidents like the attack that we saw over the weekend. And that will be part of the message that Vice President Biden will convey when he travels to Turkey later this week.\nQ: Will the Vice President also warn Turkey to stop hitting U.S. allies?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, there are no details of Turkish military operations that I'm going to talk about from here. Obviously there are concerns that the Turks have raised about Kurdish activities, and we've discussed the way in which the United States and other members of our Counter-ISIL coalition have been able to work effectively with the Syrian Arab coalition against ISIL elements inside of Syria.\nSo this is another extraordinarily complex situation, but we've made clear that everyone who is involved, including Turkey, should make going after ISIL the top priority. And Turkey, to their credit, has made clear their commitment to doing that in a variety of ways, including giving the United States and our coalition partners access to certainly military facilities inside of Turkey that allow us to take strikes efficiently against ISIL targets. So we've made that case directly to the Turks on a variety of occasions and we're certainly going to continue to do that, even as we're mindful of the terror risk for Turkey that emanates from other places, too.\nQ: And final question. The Turks are reportedly moving Hummers and tanks towards the border. Does the White House think that the Turkish incursion in Northern Syria would be useful?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not going to talk about any Turkish military movements. We've made clear all along that one of our priorities has been getting the Turks to make more consistent progress in securing the Turkey-Syria border. And they made a lot of progress on that front over the last six or nine months, and we've been gratified to see that.\nBut there certainly is more that they could do, and we would welcome them doing that. But Turkey is a NATO ally and making a valuable contribution to our Counter-ISIL coalition, and we're going to continue to coordinate with them closely as they do that. And that will certainly be an important part of Vice President Biden's visit to that country later this week.\nThanks a lot, everybody.\nEND 2:20 P.M.

More than 30,000 people have been rescued by the Coast Guard, National Guard, and other emergency responders. Thousands of people have lost everything. At least 13 lost their lives. We must make sure that all resources are brought to bear in responding to the crisis and helping communities rebuild.\n\"That is why I have called on supporters of this campaign to give what they can to the Red Cross, to bring much-needed aid and supplies to the more than 100,000 people affected by the floods. We also need to make sure that this crisis is not compounded by another, by ensuring mosquito abatement is happening hand-in-hand with flood response, to reduce the riska of mosquitoes that could carry the Zika virus from gaining a foothold in Louisiana.\n\"The best way to help Louisianans affected by these terrible floods is to make sure they have the resources they need today. I am committed to visiting communities affected by these floods, at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild together.\n\"In times of crisis, Americans have always come together to lift each other up, support each other, and rebuild stronger and better than before. That is what we must do now in Louisiana, and I am committed to standing with Louisianans every step of the way.\"", "timestamp": "2016-08-22", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on Louisiana Flooding"}

There, he posed the question to African Americans, \"What do you have to lose? You're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs.\" Today, in Akron, Trump continued: \"You can go to war zones in countries that we're fighting and it's safer than living in some of our inner cities… I ask you this. Crime. All of the problems. To the African Americans who I employ so many – so many people… What the hell do you have to lose? … You'll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Right now, you walk down the street. You get shot.\"\nHillary for America Director of State Campaigns and Political Engagement Marlon Marshall released the following statement in response:\n\"It could not be clearer how much African Americans have to lose under Donald Trump. He is doubling down on insults, fear and stereotypes that set our community back and further divide our country. But again this is not surprising, this is a man who questions the citizenship of the first African American president, has a disturbing pattern of courting white supremacists, and has been sued for housing discrimination against communities of color.\n\"As demonstrated by his bigotry and actions, Donald Trump is unfit and unqualified to be President.

The winners are selected by a panel of distinguished scientists, mathematicians, and educators following an initial selection process at the state level. Each nomination year of the award alternates between teachers in the kindergarten through 6th grade level, and those teaching 7th through 12th grades. The cohort of awardees named today represent two nomination years, one of teachers in kindergarten through 6th grade classrooms and the other in 7th through 12th grade classrooms.\nWinners of this Presidential honor receive a $10,000 award from the National Science Foundation to be used at their discretion, and are invited to Washington, DC, for an awards ceremony, as well educational and celebratory events, and visits with members of the Administration.\n\"The recipients of this award are integral to ensuring our students are equipped with critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are vital to our Nation's success,\" President Obama said. \"As the United States continues to lead the way in the innovation that is shaping our future, these excellent teachers are preparing students from all corners of the country with the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics skills that help keep us on the cutting-edge.\"\nPresident Obama and his Administration have taken significant steps to strengthen education in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields in order to fully harness the promise our Nation's students. The President's Educate to Innovate campaign, launched in November 2009, has resulted in more than $1 billion in private investment for improving K-12 STEM education. Additionally, in 2011, the President set an ambitious goal to put 100,000 additional excellent STEM teachers in America's classrooms by 2021. Thanks to the work of more than 280 organizations, 30,000 new STEM teachers have already been trained, and resources are in place to train an additional 70,000 STEM teachers by 2021. In parallel, the President has called for increasing the proficiency of America's existing STEM teachers with a Master Teacher Corps initiative, which would identify the most effective K-12 STEM teachers and support them in a program to propagate their best practices with their peers.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118832", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nIn 1872, the Congress established Yellowstone National Park—the first park of its kind anywhere in the world. Decades later, the passage of the Antiquities Act in 1906 created our first national historic preservation policy. Under this new authority, and heavily inspired by his time in nature with conservationist John Muir, President Theodore Roosevelt set aside 18 new monuments and landmarks, adding to the scattered collection of existing parks throughout our country. One decade later, in order to provide the leadership necessary for maintaining our growing system of parks, the Congress passed monumental legislation—which President Woodrow Wilson signed on August 25, 1916—to create the National Park Service (NPS). All existing National Parks were placed under the management of the NPS, ushering in a new era of conservation, exploration, and discovery—and securing, throughout the century that would follow, the profound legacy of an interconnected system of natural wonders.\nOver the course of the past 100 years, our national park system has grown to include more than 400 locations across our country. Ranging from seashores to waterfalls, winding trails to rugged mountains, historic battlefields to monuments and memorials, every treasured site under the NPS is uniquely American. Our parks play a critical role in environmental stewardship, ensuring that precious wildlife can thrive and that ecosystems can provide the many benefits on which we depend. They have sustained the stories and cultures that define the American experience, and they embody the people and movements that distinguish our Nation's journey.\nAs we reflect on the many natural and cultural gifts that our National Parks provide, we must also look to the next century and pledge to secure our precious resources. That is why my Administration has protected over 265 million acres of public lands and waters—more than any Administration in history—and worked to save endangered and vulnerable species and their vital habitats. Climate change poses the biggest threat to our planet and our parks and is already dangerously affecting park ecosystems and visitor experiences. It is imperative that we rise to meet this challenge and continue leading the global fight against climate change to ensure that our parks remain healthy for all who will come after us.\nOften called \"America's best idea,\" our National Parks belong to Americans of all ages and backgrounds. NPS sites and their recreational, educational, and public health benefits are our American birthright. Last year, these sites welcomed more than 300 million visitors, and my Administration is committed to helping all our people access and enjoy these public lands and waters. Through our \"Every Kid in a Park\" initiative, we have made our National Parks free to fourth grade students and their families so that more children, from any community or walk of life, can spend time being active in our outdoor spaces while learning about these natural treasures—something that First Lady Michelle Obama has also advocated for through her Let's Move! initiative. And through the Joining Forces initiative that she and Dr. Jill Biden have championed, more of our troops and military families can enjoy our National Parks. We must expand on these programs and increase opportunities for people in underserved communities to experience the great outdoors as well. The second century of the NPS will rely on the support and engagement of young people who are visiting more parks through the \"Find Your Park\" campaign, and we must encourage this rising generation of Americans by inviting them to make their own personal connections to the places that have shaped our history.\nNPS parks and programs strive to tell our diverse stories, allowing us to learn from the past and help write our country's next great chapters. In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service, let us thank all those who—through their dedication to the mission of the NPS—help our country build on the legacy left by all those who came before us. As we look to the next century and embrace the notion that preserving these public spaces in ways that engage, reflect, and honor all Americans has never been more important, let us summon the foresight and faith in the future to do what it takes to protect our National Parks for generations to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 25, 2016, as the 100th Anniversary of the National Park Service. I invite all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that recognize the National Park Service for maintaining and protecting our public lands for the continued benefit and enjoyment of all Americans.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA\nNOTE: This proclamation was published in the Federal Register on August 25.", "timestamp": "2016-08-22", "title": "Proclamation 9475—100th Anniversary of the National Park Service"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118904", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Baton Rouge, Louisiana\n11:13 A.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Baton Rouge, where the President will visit a region and a community that was ravaged by historic flooding just over a week ago.\nLast week, the President received regular updates on the situation and the response. He telephoned Governor Edwards and issued a disaster declaration to expedite federal assistance to the area. The President also dispatched FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate and DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson to the region to make separate visits to see the impact of the flooding firsthand and ensure that federal resources were being deployed effectively to support the ongoing efforts of states and local officials who are leading the response.\nThe federal efforts, thanks in no small part to the experience and expertise of Administrator Fugate, have been praised by Democratic and Republican Louisiana officials alike. There's new information out this morning that illustrates the speed and effectiveness of the federal response. In less than two weeks, more than $120 million in federal assistance to affected individuals has been approved. This will help with things like buying groceries, urgent home repairs, and even temporary housing assistance to those who need it.\nSo this is a strong and early indication that the United States government is determined to support the people of Baton Rouge in their time of urgent need. And part of the President's message today is that the federal government will be here long after national media attention has faded.\nWe'll have additional details about the President's trip over the course of the day, but the President will have an opportunity to visit a neighborhood that was damaged in the flood. He'll have a chance to offer some comfort to individuals whose lives have been upended. He'll discuss the recovery with state and local officials to learn if there is more that FEMA can and should be doing to support the state and local response.\nHe'll also thank first responders who acted heroically to save lives at the height of the flood. Some of these first responders have even continued to work long shifts even as their own lives and families have been affected by the flooding. That reflects the spirit of this community and of the country. And that's the essence of what makes the President so confident that with continued tenacity, skill and attention to detail, this community will rebuild and come back stronger than ever.\nSo we're obviously limited in how much detail about the President's activities today we can share in advance because of the security constraints. We've also gone to great lengths to try to minimize the impact of the President's visit on ongoing response and recovery efforts. But over the course of the day and as the President engages in some of these conversations and some of this activity, we'll try to keep you apprised of what exactly the President is doing.\nSo, with that, why don't we talk about the trip or anything else that might be on your minds today.\nQ: Do you have an estimate yet of the damage on a large scale from FEMA or anybody else?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen a formal estimate at this point about what will be needed to rebuild after this historic flooding event. Obviously FEMA officials have some expertise that they bring to that kind of damage assessment. They'll be working closely with state and local officials to reach that kind of determination. But I haven't seen those numbers at this point, but obviously as we have that kind of information, it's something that local official in coordination with FEMA -- they'll be responsible for disseminating that information.\nQ: Josh, on the $120 million figure, you said it's approved. Does that mean it's actually been paid out, or what does that mean?\nMR. EARNEST: Some of it has been paid out, and some of it has been approved, so it's sort of in the midst of being paid out. And again, it's an illustration of the variety of forms of assistance that the federal government can make available to affected individuals in short order. It certainly is not the entirety of the assistance that individuals may be eligible to receive.\nThere are other forms of assistance that take a little bit longer to process and will also be available. In some cases, that includes low-interest loans, and in some cases, that isn't just through FEMA. The Small Business Administration, for example, has a disaster relief program where they can make short-term, essentially bridge loans to small businesses to help them through these kinds of situations. Those typically aren't grants, but they are extraordinarily low-interest loans that can mean the difference between a small business going under and a small business being able to survive in the aftermath of a disaster like this.\nQ: Without giving too much detail about the neighborhood, can we just say -- is it a Baton Rouge neighborhood? Is it a neighborhood outside of Baton Rouge?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that this is a neighborhood in East Baton Rogue Parish. But we'll have more detail once we've arrived in the neighborhood.\nQ: The President's response to people who say this is politics, this is optics -- is he dismayed by it? Has he just gotten used to the fact that people make that argument all the time? What does he make of all this?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President is used to people trying to score political points even in situations where they shouldn't. And the President certainly believes this is the kind of situation where when we're talking about lives lost, when we're talking about a community being upended, that it's an appropriate time to put politics aside and actually focus on our responsibilities as Americans.\nAnd, look, I think the truth of the matter is most people in Louisiana are doing exactly that. And, again, officials in both parties in Louisiana have talked about the effective working relationship among state, local and federal officials who are trying to provide assistance to people who need it. And that, frankly, is the approach that the President is taking. And he believes that's where our attention should be. And that certainly has characterized the response that we've seen from the federal government, including the response that you've seen from the President, personally.\nQ: -- expectation surprising when the Lieutenant Governor makes a comment like that, or is basically supportive of the federal response -- is it surprising that you get a response like that?\nMR. EARNEST: The Lieutenant Governor is a good illustration. He's the highest-ranking Republican official in the state of Louisiana, and he has now on at least two occasions talked about how pleased he has been thus far at the federal response.\nI want to caution throughout this thing, throughout this discussion, that the early quick response is really important, but the success of the recovery effort is going to require a long-term focus. And the President is certainly mindful of that. People of FEMA are mindful of that. And that will be part of the President's message today.\nBut, look, the Lieutenant Governor of the state of Louisiana has a responsibility to the people who elected him, and people in his state are suffering right now. And I think he's taken the right approach, which is to say, I've got lots of political disagreements with the President of the United States, but what I'm most interested in is seeing the President of the United States prioritize the safety and livelihood of the people in my state.\nThat's what the President of the United States has done, and that certainly is what FEMA has done. That's what other senior administration officials have done. And the Lieutenant Governor of the state of Louisiana has acknowledged that. And I think he's acknowledged that in the hopes that the attention on this issue at the federal level will continue. And I can assure him today, standing here on the plane with the President of the United States, that that attention will continue and will persist in the weeks and months to come.\nQ: Josh, on the $120 million, is there a way to get a breakdown of where that money is going sometime today? And you said it's been approved, and I want to follow up just a bit. When do people start receiving it? Is it days, weeks, months? Can you walk us through that a bit?\nMR. EARNEST: We'll have more details on this. What I can tell you is that some of those payments have already been made. There are people who have had to flee their homes. They've been inundated with water and their homes are no longer livable. So there are some people who are staying in local hotels, or have had to seek housing in other places. And there is money that's gone out the door to assist them, to pay for that temporary housing.\nThat's an example of some money that's gone out the door already. There are other people who -- they've got small children at home, and they have to go buy diapers for their kids, and the diapers that they kept in the nursery have been inundated by flood waters, so they need money to be able to go and buy those diapers. That is the kind of assistance that can be provided by FEMA.\nAnd again, that urgent need needs to be met, and we're gratified that early indications are that that need is being met. But families whose homes have been destroyed, or at least sustained significant damage, are going to need more than a week's supply of diapers to rebuild and to come back. And so that's one illustration of how we need to make sure that we're not just focusing on the urgent needs, as important as they are, but that we're also following through with the longer-term assistance that will be required to get the people of this community back on their feet.\nBut in terms of how much money has gone out the door at this point, FEMA may be able to provide you some more detail on that. But obviously this is a very dynamic situation and they're working to process requests for assistance as quickly as they possibly can to get that money out the door. So some funding has gone out the door. A whole bunch of -- a significant sum of money has also been approved to get those payments out the door. So this is something that they're moving through quite rapidly.\nOne other point that I would make here is -- and this is something that you've heard from state and local officials, as well -- there's an important role for the private sector to play here, too. And I know that there are large companies that have made substantial donations to this effort, and we want to keep that kind of charitable work moving.\nThere's an opportunity for the American people to make a contribution to this effort through the Red Cross. And the Red Cross obviously has a lot of expertise in these kinds of situations, and so we obviously would encourage people to support the Red Cross as they provide badly needed assistance, as well.\nThere's an opportunity for us as a country to come together, not just through government institutions, to offer some support, but the Red Cross obviously does important work and there are other large companies that have stepped up to the plate to offer some assistance, too. And we obviously want to thank them for their generosity and encourage people to continue to consider making that kind of contribution, again, to a community that's been hit really hard by a historic flooding event, even if it wasn't a named storm.\nQ: It sounds like donations to this event have been lower than they have for some other natural disasters in recent years. Is that going to be part of the President's message today, to try to change that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think part of the President's message is going to be not just to the people of Baton Rouge that the American people stand with them, but also a reminder to people all across the country that when any American community takes a hit, we come together as a country to support them, and there are a variety of ways that we can do that. And we can certainly do that by mobilizing an effective federal government response. We can also do that by people considering what they can do on their own time and what sort of financial contributions they can make of their own free will to support this ongoing effort.\nAnd again, the Red Cross is an institution that's got a lot of expertise, and unfortunately, they've got a history of meeting the needs of people in Louisiana who have been hit by bad storms. So I would expect that you will hear the President encourage the American people to consider what they can do to support the people of Baton Rouge and the people of Louisiana in this difficult time.\nAyesha, did you have a question?\nQ: Can you talk about long-term support for the people of Baton Rouge and the people who have been affected by this storm? Do you have any sense of what that will mean in terms of funding? Some Louisiana lawmakers have said that maybe Congress will need to appropriate some more funds; that because of the extensive damage, that you're going to need more than kind of regular response and more than regular funding that's been doled out. So does the administration have any sense of the amount of funding that would be needed, or whether Congress will need to do -- step up and appropriate any funds?\nMR. EARNEST: To answer your question directly, not yet. We don't have a sense yet of exactly how much federal assistance will be required to ensure the full recovery of the community of Baton Rouge, to ensure this community can come back stronger than ever. It's unclear at this point whether a separate, standalone supplemental funding request will be required.\nI suspect that will be part of the conversation that the President has today when he talks to the Governor, when he talks to parish officials, when he talks to congressional representatives who may be along for the trip, as well. So I think it's too early to say. None are on the plane. They're obviously back in Louisiana for the recess, but I would expect to see some congressional representatives around today. And as they appear, we'll make sure that you're aware of it.\nQ: On one other topic -- some Republicans have indicated that they'd be willing to work with Secretary Clinton, if she's elected, to fix -- their words -- Obamacare. Does the President think that that would be something that he would view positively if changes are made to Obamacare in a new Democratic administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that would obviously reflect a remarkable reversal on the part of Republicans, who, to this point, have dedicated the last six or seven years of their legislative agenda to trying to tear down the Affordable Care Act. They have utterly failed in that effort. Some might even describe it as a colossal waste of time. But we'll let voters make that assessment.\nThe President has indicated since the very first Affordable Care Act vote was taken in Congress that he was prepared to work with Democrats and Republicans who had good ideas for strengthening the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, we haven't seen many Republicans come up with ideas to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. There's lots of rhetoric about tearing down the Affordable Care Act, but certainly never any alternatives to the Affordable Care Act -- something that many Republicans have spent a lot of credibility promising, but that has been -- credibility that's been flushed down the proverbial toilet here because that's something that Republicans have never mustered.\nSo I think the President would welcome a renewed, genuine commitment on the part of Republicans to work in bipartisan fashion to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, expand access to Medicaid, and to further strengthen marketplaces and other reforms to the program that would continue to hold down growth in health care costs and continue to expand access to quality, affordable coverage for Americans across the country.\nLouisiana is actually a state where we saw the Democratic governor do the right thing and expand access to Medicaid in the state of Louisiana in a way that has expanded access to health care for hundreds of thousands of people in Louisiana. We would welcome additional Republican governors across the country making a similar commitment and taking a similar step. But when it comes to Congress, we would certainly welcome bipartisan efforts to strengthen Obamacare even after President Obama has left office.\nQ: The Vice President is in Latvia this morning, and when doing a family photo with the President there -- the Estonian President -- he made a comment about a presidential candidate who doesn't understand Article 5 of NATO. Do you think -- does the White House think that this is appropriate for the Vice President to be injecting presidential campaigning into an official meeting overseas? And if so, why?\nMR. EARNEST: Vice President Biden is in Latvia today. He will have an opportunity to meet with the Presidents of all three Baltic countries while he's in Latvia. The President did something similar when he traveled to Tallinn in Estonia a couple of years ago. President Obama met with the three Baltic Presidents and reaffirmed the United States' commitment to Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which commits the United States and all of our NATO allies to coming to the defense of the Baltic countries if they come under attack by anyone, including Russia.\nBecause of the size of the Baltic countries and because of the border they share with Russia, they're justifiably concerned about some of the provocative actions that we've seen from Russia in the last few years. And President Obama has made clear that it is dangerous to raise any doubts about the U.S. commitment to our NATO allies.\nI'll say again that the U.S. commitment to our NATO allies is ironclad. The U.S. commitment to Article 5 of the NATO treaty is ironclad. And there should be no confusion about that. And I didn't see the entirety of the Vice President's remarks, but I'm confident that his remarks were an effort to clear up any confusion that may exist on this front. And some of that confusion may stem from some of the rhetoric that we've seen on the campaign trail. That's unfortunate, because the President has been crystal-clear about our country's ironclad commitment to our NATO allies. That is a commitment that transcends presidencies; it transcends political party. And the Vice President's trip there was another indication of that ironclad commitment on the part of the United States.\nQ: Are we at a point where presidential politics is now part of official business overseas when it comes to issues like this?\nMR. EARNEST: I think when it comes to issues like U.S. commitment -- the U.S. commitment to our NATO allies, it's important for everyone to understand -- both our allies and our potential adversaries -- that the U.S. commitment to our NATO allies is ironclad. Vice President Biden's trip there is as good an illustration as you can have about that kind of commitment.\nAnd during the President's trip to Poland for the NATO Summit there was a discussion about additional military commitments that NATO allies were making to the Baltics. Germany, Canada and the UK committed to deployment of additional forces on the ground in each of those Baltic countries under the NATO umbrella to demonstrate our continued commitment to the mutual self-defense of our Baltic allies. The United States is committed to deployment of additional troops into Poland for the same purpose.\nSo our commitment to our NATO allies is ironclad. And again, to the extent that there is any rhetoric that might leave people wondering about that commitment, the Vice President's trip and his statement today should clear up any of that lingering confusion to the extent there is any.\nQ: The President is not going to the Clinton Global Initiative this year.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nQ: That's good. (Laughter.) Is he 100 percent confident in the work of the Clinton Global Initiative and all of the management questions and financial questions that have been raised? Is there anything that has made him less than 100 percent confident in the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation work?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President is familiar with the extensive, excellent work that has been done by the Clinton Global Foundation in the United States and around the world, and that's why the President has been proud to be a part of previous efforts to raise attention and awareness about the good work of the Clinton Global Foundation.\nThe President, of course, can't speak to everything that happens at the foundation. I'll let my counterparts at the foundation do that. But there's no denying the way that the lives of millions of people around the world, including people in the United States, have benefitted from the excellent work by the professionals at the Clinton Foundation. And that's why the President has been proud to speak there in the context of previous events. The last couple of years, the President has not had time on his schedule to appear at the Clinton Global Initiative.\nThanks, guys.\nEND 11:37 A.M.

Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119176", "text": "On November 8th, we are going to declare our independence from special interests, corrupt politicians, and from a rigged system that benefits only the insiders.\nWe are going to declare our independence from media executives that don't care about us, and politicians who don't listen to us.\nWe are going to declare our independence from rising crime, soaring poverty and crushing debt.\nWe are going to declare our independence from failures of the past and create a New American Future.\nOnce again, we will have a government of, by, and for the people.\nAmericanism, not globalism, will be our credo.\nIt's going to be America First from now on.\nLet me tell you what this new future looks like.\nWe are going to cut taxes and create millions of new jobs.\nWe are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nWe are going to appoint judges who will support, defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States.\nWe are going to save and cherish the 2nd amendment.\nWe will ensure every Veteran in this country has the right to seek medical treatment at a VA facility, or with the private doctor of their choice.\nWe're going to eliminate job-killing regulations.\nWe are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution.\nLet's talk about another issue that is important to our future, and the future of our children.\nThat's the issue of crime. Violent crime is rising across the country. More than 2,700 have been shot in Chicago alone this year.\nNo American should consider this level of crime acceptable. Every American has the right to live in safety and peace.\nA Trump Administration is going to restore law and order.\nLet me take this opportunity to thank our wonderful police and law enforcement officers. This state has known unbelievable heartache in recent days after the murder of 5 police officers, and the wounding of another 7, in the assault on Dallas. We pray for the families, and hope for the speedy recovery of the wounded.\nTo all law enforcement in America: we are with you, we support you, and we will always stand with you.\nTogether, we will create a safe community for every citizen in the land – but especially those who have not known safety in a very, very long time.\nThat includes appointing an Attorney General and a Secretary of Homeland Security who are completely committed to upholding the law.\nI will appoint federal officials and investigators who will work hand-in-hand with police and citizens to dismantle gangs, cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people.\nI will appoint prosecutors who will go into the most dangerous communities in America and work to liberate our citizens from violence and fear.\nAll citizens deserve to be protected. No American left behind.\nI want every African-American parent in this country – and all parents in this country – to be able to raise their kids in safety.\nAnd I want to ensure every African-American child in this country – and all children in this country – are put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.\nWe are going to have school choice, charter schools, and merit-pay for teachers. My opponent, Hillary Clinton, discriminates against African-American students by opposing school choice because she is owned and paid for by the education bureaucracy.\nNo one owns me. I answer only to the American people.\nIn a New York Post column, Deroy Murdock, published data confirming what I've been saying about the devastating economic conditions in the African-American communities. Murdock confirms these facts:\n\"The overall labor force participation rate for black Americans has slipped from 63.2 percent to 61.2 percent — down 3.2 percent.\nThis metric also slumped for black teenagers, from 29.6 percent to 27.7 percent — down 6.4 percent.\nThe percentage of black Americans in poverty has grown under Obama, the Census Bureau reports, from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent in 2014 — up 1.6 percent.\nThe number of blacks on Food Stamps soared under Obama — from 7.4 million in 2009 to 11.7 million in 2014 — up 58.2 percent.\nAlso, from Obama's arrival through last June 30, the percentage of black Americans who own homes plunged from 46.1 to 41.7 percent, the Census reports — down 9.5 percent.\"\nNearly 4 in 10 African American children live in poverty. 58 percent of young African Americans are not employed.\nHomicide is up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and up more than 60 percent in Baltimore. Violent crime rose 17 percent in the fifty largest US cities.\nThis is the legacy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nTo those suffering I say: what do you have to lose by trying something new?\nLet me also tell you what you have to gain: more jobs, higher wages, and a massive reduction in the terrible crime plaguing our inner cities.\nWe are going to turn it all around. Success must be created for everyone, and available to everyone.\nThat is how we are going to create a New American Future.\nBut to make every American safe and prosperous, we must address one of the most vital issues of all: Border Security.\nWe are going to build a wall.\nWe are going to enforce the law.\nWe are going to protect your jobs and wages.\nAnd we are going to keep our country safe.\nAccording to the Texas government, nearly two hundred thousand illegal immigrants were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016. Collectively, those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses, including 1,055 homicides, 5,516 sexual assault charges and more than 50,000 charges of either burglary or theft.\nYet, Hillary Clinton wants a totally, completely open border.\nShe wants catch-and-release.\nObamacare for illegal immigrants.\nMassive amnesty in her first 100 days.\nShe wants to gut immigration enforcement.\nShe supports Sanctuary Cities.\nShe wants to let people overstay their visas without removal.\nOne lawless order after another.\nWe must not let it happen.\nHillary Clinton also wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. There have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the United States since 9/11, and a number of terrible attacks like the Boston Bombing, San Bernardino and Orlando. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to fling open the floodgates even wider.\nI want to create safe zones in the Middle East. My plan suspends visas when we can't perform effective screening, and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who don't support our values. After all, that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all about.\nThis election will decide whether or not we have a border.\nThis election will decide whether or not we have a country.\nToday I met with the moms of American children killed by illegal immigrants as a result of the policies Hillary Clinton supports. Hillary Clinton will never meet with these families, she will never hear these stories.\nThese are all forgotten Americans – they are not Hollywood or media stars, or big money special interest donors.\nShe is bought-and-paid-for by the special interests.\nThis corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our Democracy. Every day more and more alarming facts come out.\nThe scandal I speak of is the State Department's Pay-For-Play Scandal under Hillary Clinton.\nIf our Secretary of State can be bought, or bribed, or sell or trade government favors, then the whole American system is threatened.\nIt is a threat to the foundation of Democracy itself. This is what happens in a Third World country – it's the failed conditions people flee when they come to America.\nAmerica can never elect a candidate who, like Hillary Clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash.\nThe new revelations about Hillary Clinton's email scandal make clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.\nHillary Clinton is desperate to cover-up her crimes. That's why she deleted 33,000 emails. That's also why she lied repeatedly to Congress and the American public.\nShe said she never sent or received classified materials.\nThat was a lie, proved over and over again.\nShe claimed she used an insecure email server for the convenience of using only one device. But she used multiple devices.\nAnother lie.\nUnder penalty of perjury, she said she turned over all of her work-related emails. But the FBI found thousands she never turned over, and now just found another 15,000 more.\nAnother Clinton lie.\nShe said she sent nothing marked classified.\nA total lie, unmasked to the world. And more to come.\nShe said her server was secure, and had no breaches. But we know now it was completely unsecure, and the FBI Director said it could easily be hacked by our foreign enemies.\nMore Clinton lies.\nClinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them.\nOne more Hillary Clinton lie.\nLie after lie after lie.\nHillary Clinton is unfit to hold public office.\nIt is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons' set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money.\nIt goes back to the Arkansas days, and it continued during the White House days with the sale of the Lincoln Bedroom to large donors.\nBut once Bill was out of office the small time Clinton business – or, more accurately, their crime enterprise – grew with the roles reversed. Bill, now an ex-President collected the money for the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had the public offices to sell; Senator, Secretary of State and for all that time a potential President. They turned this into an exponentially larger business.\nBut it was more than a business, it was a continuing big time criminal enterprise. It involved numerous violations of the conflict of interest and bribery laws and other serious laws of the United States.\nThe e-mails and phone logs show that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Department of State were one and the same. If you donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid massive speaking fees to Bill Clinton, you got an entry to the Department of State. Together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale of public office since the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s.\nToday a phone log was released for Cheryl Mills. She was Secretary of State Clinton's Chief of Staff. You would expect the log to contain only calls concerning Department of State business. But Cheryl Mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the Chief Operating Officer of the Clinton Foundation – no other individual or group appears to have left that many messages.\nWe also just learned today that more than half the people who met with Hillary Clinton from outside government while she was Secretary of State were donors to the Foundation.\nThis creates the nexus which is at the core of a RICO case. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise.\nThe specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech. I walked through two of them yesterday – the sale of U.S. Uranium to Russia, and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid Bill Clinton for a speech.\nThe UBS saga is another one. Shortly after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State she went to Geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of Americans.\nShe negotiated a very good deal for UBS and a very bad deal for law enforcement. Of the 52,000 accounts the U.S. was seeking, the government settled for only 4,450 accounts. Her intervention was described by Treasury as unusual.\nBefore her unusual intervention UBS had donated only $60,000 to the Foundation. After the Clinton favor for UBS, it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a $600,000 contribution, a $32 million loan and a $1.5 million speaking fee for Bill Clinton.\nThis is corruption, pure and simple.\nThis is why I have called for a special prosecutor.\nJustice is supposed to be blind. It's never supposed to be for sale.\nIn the long-run, there is only one way to end the corruption in our country: elect Donald J. Trump.\nHillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.\nYou will be voting for justice, fairness and equality.\nYou will also be voting for a more inclusive country, where no one is left out.\nAnother 2 million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty. Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1,000 under President Obama. The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent.\nOur pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family agenda is going to bring hope back to every community in our nation. I will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all those who live in poverty.\nWe reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.\nThe era of division is coming to end. We will create a new future of American unity.\nAre you ready for real American change?\nIt is time to emphasize what we all have in common as Americans.\nWe will promote our common culture, values and principles.\nWe will be one nation.\nWe will be one people.\nWe will share together one great future.\nIt's going to be America First.\nTogether, we will make America proud again.\nWe will make America prosperous again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nFriends, citizens and fellow Americans: We will make America great again.", "timestamp": "2016-08-23", "title": "Remarks at Luedecke Arena in Austin, Texas"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 1 p.m. in the driveway of a flood-damaged home in the Castle Place subdivision. In his remarks, he referred to Donna Edwards, wife of Gov. Edwards; and Zachary, LA, resident Linda Fernandez, who told the President of the recent death of her daughter.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118833", "text": "The President. Well, to begin with, I just want to say thank you to the outstanding officials behind me who have been on the ground, working 24/7 since this flood happened. It begins with outstanding leadership from the top with Governor John Bel Edwards. And we very much appreciate all the outstanding work he's done. His better half, the First Lady of Louisiana, I know has been by his side every step of the way, and we are grateful for her. I know they've got their own cleaning up to do because the Governor's Mansion was flooded as well.\nIn addition, I want to acknowledge Senator Bill Cassidy, Senator David Vitter, Representative Garret Graves, and Representative Cedric Richmond; the Mayor of Baton Rouge, Kip Holden; and somebody who I can't brag enough about, one of the best hires I made as President, the Administrator of FEMA, Craig Fugate, who has done such an outstanding job not just in dealing with this particular incident, but has really rebuilt FEMA so that there's a change of culture. And everybody knows that when the disaster happens, FEMA is going to be there on the ground, cooperating with State and local officials rapidly and with attention to detail, and keeping the families who've been affected uppermost in their minds. So we very much appreciate everything Craig's done.\nIt's hard, by the way, for Craig to be here because he's a Florida Gator—[laughter]—and he's been seeing a lot of LSU T-shirts as we've been passing by.\nI just had a chance to see some of the damage from the historic floods here in Louisiana. I come here, first and foremost, to say that the prayers of the entire Nation are with everybody who lost loved ones. We are heartbroken by the loss of life. There are also people who are still desperately trying to track down friends and family. We're going to keep on helping them every way that we can.\nAs I think anybody who can see just the streets, much less the inside of the homes here—people's lives have been upended by this flood. Local businesses have suffered some terrible damage. Families have, in some cases, lost homes. They've certainly lost possessions, priceless keepsakes. I was just speaking to a young woman whose husband died shortly after the birth of her second child, and she was talking about how her daughter was trying to gather all the keepsakes that she had in her bedroom that reminded her of her father. And that gives you some sense that this is not just about property damage. This is about people's roots.\nYou also have a situation where there are a lot of kids who are supposed to start a new school year, and they're going to need some special help and support for a while.\nSometimes, when these kinds of things happen, it can seem a little bit too much to bear. But what I want the people of Louisiana to know is that you're not alone on this. Even after the TV cameras leave, the whole country is going to continue to support you and help you until we get folks back in their homes and lives are rebuilt.\nAnd the reason I can say that with confidence is because that's what Americans do in times like this. I saw it when I visited displaced Louisianans when I came down here as a Senator after Katrina. I saw it when I visited New Orleans for the 10th anniversary last year. I know how resilient the people of Louisiana are, and I know that you will rebuild again. And what I've seen today proves it.\nI want to thank all the first responders, the National Guard, all the good neighbors who were in a boat going around and making sure people were safe, showing extraordinary heroism and in some cases risking their own lives. Governor Edwards, the State of Louisiana, the city, the parish governments, they've all stepped up under incredibly difficult circumstances.\nI just want to thank the people on this block. As I was walking down, one woman at the end, elderly, she was on her own. She had just lost her daughter. You had a young man next door who was helping out his father, but had also offered to help out that neighbor, so that she could salvage as much as she could and start the process of rebuilding.\nWith respect to the Federal response, over a week ago I directed the Federal Government to mobilize and do everything we could to help. FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate arrived here a week ago to help lead that effort. Secretary of Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson visited last week to make sure State and local officials are getting what they need.\nTo give you a sense of the magnitude of the situation here, more than 100,000 people have applied for Federal assistance so far. As of today, Federal support has reached $127 million. That's for help like temporary rental assistance, essential home repairs, and flood insurance payments.\nFEMA is also working with Louisiana around the clock to help people who were displaced by floods find temporary housing. And any Louisiana family that needs help, you can find your nearest disaster recovery center by visiting FEMA.gov or calling 1-800-621-FEMA. I'm going to repeat that: FEMA.gov or 1-800-621-FEMA.\nNow, Federal assistance alone is not going to be enough to make people's lives whole again. So I'm asking every American to do what you can to help get families and local businesses back on their feet. If you want help—if you want to help, Governor Edwards put together some ways to start at volunteerlouisiana.gov. That's volunteerlouisiana.gov.\nAnd the reason this is important is because even though Federal money is moving out, volunteer help actually helps the State because it can offset some of its costs. Obviously, private donations are going to be extremely important as well. We want to thank the Red Cross for everything they're doing, but there are a lot of private philanthropic organizations, churches, parishes around the State and around the country who want to help as well. And that's how we're going to make sure that everybody is able to get back on their feet.\nSo let me just remind folks: Sometimes, once the floodwaters pass, people's attention spans pass. This is not a one-off. This is not a photo op issue. This is, how do you make sure that a month from now, 3 months from now, 6 months from now, people still are getting the help that they need? I need all Americans to stay focused on this. If you're watching this today, make sure that you find out how you can help. You can go to volunteerlouisiana.gov, or you can go to FEMA.gov. We'll tell you. We'll direct you—you can go to whitehouse.gov, and we'll direct you how you can help, all right?\nBut we're going to need to stay on this because these are some good people down here. We're glad that the families I had a chance to meet are safe, but they've got a lot of work to do, and they shouldn't have to do it alone. All right?\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless. Federal Disaster Assistance\nQ. With the damage you've seen, what more help may they need from Congress in terms of emergency spending?\nThe President. You know, we discussed that on the way down here. What you have is, the Stafford Act provides a certain match. A lot of the homes have flood insurance, but a lot of homes don't. And what Craig Fugate is doing, what I instructed him to do from the start, is let's get money out as fast as we can. Because we know that there's going to be a certain amount of assistance that's going to be forthcoming, so there's no point in waiting. We kind of make initial estimates and we start pushing stuff out. That helps us and helps the Governor and all these officials here do their jobs.\nAnd then what we have to do is, as we fine-tune exactly what's needed—when we know, for example, how much permanent housing is going to have to be built, when we have a better sense of how much infrastructure has been damaged, what more we need to do in terms of mitigation strategies—that's when Congress, I think, may be called upon to do some more.\nNow, the good news is, is that you've got four Members of Congress right here, and a number of them happen to be in the majority, so I suspect that they may be able to talk to the Speaker and talk to Mitch McConnell. But in part because of the fine stewardship at FEMA and, frankly, because we've been a little lucky so far—and I'm going to knock on some wood—in terms of the amount of money that's gone out this year, FEMA has enough money for now to cover the costs that can be absorbed.\nThe issue is going to be less what we need to do in terms of paying for the short term; it's going to be the medium-term and the long-term rebuilding. Congress should be back in session right after Labor Day. By that time we'll probably have a better assessment. And in the meantime, lawyers at FEMA will be examining what statutory flexibility we've got. And I know the Governor has been right on top of making sure that Louisiana gets everything that it can get in order to help rebuild.\nThe President's Visit to Louisiana/Federal Disaster Assistance\nQ. Mr. President, do you worry about that process becoming politicized and the trip here becoming politicized?\nThe President. No, I don't. First of all, one of the benefits of being 5 months short of leaving here is I don't worry too much about politics.\nThe second thing I have seen, historically, is that when disasters strike, that's probably one of the few times where Washington tends not to get political. I guarantee you nobody on this block, none of those first responders, nobody gives a hoot whether you're Democrat or Republican. What they care about is making sure they're getting the drywall out and the carpet out, and there's not any mold building, and they get some contractors in here and they start rebuilding as quick as possible. That's what they care about. That's what I care about.\nSo we want to make sure that we do it right. We want to make sure that we do it systematically. But the one thing I just want to repeat is how proud I am of FEMA. Because if you think about the number of significant natural disasters that have occurred since my Presidency began, you'd be hard pressed to find a local official anywhere in the country, including those in the other party, who wouldn't say that Craig Fugate and his team have been anything less than exemplary and professional. And one of the things I did when I walked through each of these homes was ask, have you contacted FEMA? Have you filed? And uniformly they said that they had been in touch with FEMA; they had acted professionally. Some of them had already been out here for inspections.\nAnd I think that does indicate why it's important for us to take the Federal Government seriously, Federal workers seriously. There's a tendency sometimes for us to bash them and to think that they're these faceless bureaucrats. But when you get into trouble, you want somebody who knows what they're doing, who's on the ground working with outstanding officials. And that's true whatever party. And I could not be prouder of the work that FEMA has done.\nThat doesn't mean that there aren't going to still be folks who need more help, and that we're not going to have some constraints statutorily, and Congress isn't going to have to step up. But it does mean that the basic backbone, the basic infrastructure and architecture that we have in terms of disaster response, I think, has been high quality. And I'm very proud of them for that. And I want to publicly acknowledge that at the moment, all right?\nThank you, guys.", "timestamp": "2016-08-23", "title": "Remarks Following a Tour of Flood Damage and an Exchange With Reporters in Zachary, Louisiana"}

The report released today follows our call, together with international partners, last year to identify those involved in the use of chemical weapons in attacks in 2014 and 2015.\nIt is now impossible to deny that the Syrian regime has repeatedly used industrial chlorine as a weapon against its own people in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and UN Security Council Resolution 2118. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the Asad regime's use of chlorine against its own people.

We urge all UN member states and parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention, including Russia and Iran, to participate in this effort.\nThe OPCW-UN report also confirmed that in August 2015, ISIL used mustard gas against civilians in Syria. The U.S.-led Counter-ISIL coalition has placed a high priority on targeting ISIL's chemical weapons capabilities, including by capturing one of its chemical weapons manufacturing leaders in March 2016 and using information gained from him to launch airstrikes to degrade ISIL's ability to use such weapons. We continue to remove leaders from the battlefield with knowledge of these weapons and will target any related materials and attempts to manufacture such chemicals going forward.\nThe findings by the UN and the OPCW present yet another opportunity for all nations to speak with one voice to address these heinous crimes and to make it clear that the use of chemical weapons is intolerable.", "timestamp": "2016-08-24", "title": "Press Release - Statement by NSC Spokesperson Ned Price on the UN-OPCW Report on Syria"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118907", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:45 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I do not have any comments on the top, so, Kathleen, you can go ahead and get us started.\nQ: I wanted to start with the Turkish operation into Syria, if you have any comments. I know officials have said the U.S. is closely involved in planning that. And particularly, if the U.S. is at all worried about escalating tensions between Turks and the Syrian Kurds.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you referred to a couple of the many complicated dynamics inside of Syria. I think to directly answer your question, the United States has been encouraging the Turks for quite some time to take decisive action to close the Turkey-Syria border, particularly this portion of the border.\nThose of you who covered the President's trip to Antalya, Turkey, where the G20 was last fall, will recall that this is an issue that came up in a bilateral meeting between President Obama and President Erdogan. So the fact that Turkey has taken these steps is an indication of important progress. And even in the context of that meeting that President Obama had with his Turkish counterpart last fall, President Obama assured President Erdogan that if the Turks sought U.S. and coalition assistance for those efforts that we would be happy to provide that kind of assistance, because we understand the strategic priority associated with closing that border, in part because we know that some ISIL supply lines traverse the border in that region, and so being able to shut that down can be part of our broader strategic effort.\nSo that's the first part. And my colleagues at the Department of Defense can provide you some more detail about how exactly the United States is able to provide military support for those ongoing efforts. Obviously, the United States has some unique capabilities that can be valuable in an operation like this. And our NATO allies in Turkey have made valuable contributions to the counter-ISIL campaign, and this is just the latest example.\nYou also made a reference to the long-running tensions between Turks and Kurdish forces and Kurdish populations in that region of the world. Those kinds of tensions have been simmering for a long time. And of course, that's something that we monitor, and the United States has been decisive and forceful in condemning acts of terrorism. On the other hand, there have been some forces inside of Syria that include some Kurdish elements that have been making an important contribution to our counter-ISIL efforts. So there's no denying it's complicated, and of course, it's something that we're mindful of and monitoring.\nQ: And just to move on to one other -- there's a lot of discussion about the increase of prices for EpiPen. I don't know if the President has been following this debate, but some in Congress are calling for a hearing, and Hillary Clinton has called the price spike \"a troubling example of a company taking advantage of consumers.\" I'm just wondering if the President shares that view and thinks that there's anything the government can do to intervene there.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this certainly is an issue that's gotten a lot of attention in the media over the last couple of weeks. I'll start by saying that one of the goals of the Obama administration has been to limit the growth in health care costs, including trying to reduce costs of prescription drugs. And the Affordable Care Act has made an impact on putting downward pressure on health care inflation, but there certainly are some other steps that we believe the federal government should take. Unfortunately, all too often it's Republicans in Congress who are standing up for pharmaceutical companies and not looking out for taxpayers and patients here in the United States.\nSo there certainly is more that we believe can and should be done in general to address the question of rising prescription drug prices. As it relates to this specific issue, obviously I'm not going to make a specific comment or specifically second-guess the pricing strategy or the business practices of one private enterprise. I will observe, however, that pharmaceutical companies that often try to portray themselves as the inventors of lifesaving medication often do real damage to their reputation by being greedy and jacking up prices in a way that victimizes vulnerable Americans. And I think it raises significant questions, even moral questions, in the minds of a lot of people.\nSo we certainly have seen other high-profile incidents of pharmaceutical companies that have taken a hit both to their reputation and their stock price for engaging in unscrupulous practices. And I think other companies, including other pharmaceutical companies, would be wise to learn those lessons.\nQ: Is this an example of a company being greedy and jacking up prices?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not going to second-guess the specific business practices of a private company.\nQ: Why not?\nMR. EARNEST: There's a role for private companies and private entities to make their own decisions, and we're a government enterprise and we're focused on some other things. So I'm not going to second-guess that.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thank you. There was an attack today at the American University in Kabul, and I just want to see has the President been briefed on that, and do you have any statement on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know to what extent the President has been briefed on this issue. I can tell you that White House officials are following the situation. Based on the latest update that I have received, there are still forces on the ground -- Afghan forces -- that are still clearing the university. But my understanding is that the fighting has -- or at least the shooting has stopped for the time being, but there's still ongoing efforts to ensure that the situation has been resolved.\nI don't have an update for you in terms of what the casualty reports are. But I can also tell you -- and I think this is something that the Department of Defense has indicated, which was that there are coalition advisors that are assisting Afghan forces in the effort to clear the university.\nAgain, I think this underscores the significant challenge facing the people of Afghanistan, particularly as it relates to their security situation. But we continue to see the skill and professionalism of Afghan security forces improve. And that's not happening by accident. That's happening because of the commitment that the United States and our NATO partners have made to enhancing the capacity and capability of Afghan security forces to provide for the security situation in their own country.\nQ: So the U.N. Security Council is meeting today to discuss North Korea's latest missile launch from a submarine. Earlier this month, the U.N. was unable to condemn another missile launch by North Korea because China wanted the statement to also oppose the deployment of the U.S. anti-missile defense system in South Korea. I was wondering, is that a concern for the White House? I mean, China is the -- seems to be one of the only countries that has any sway over North Korea, and they're -- and China is raising concerns about U.S. actions in the region. So is that a concern?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by just acknowledging that the U.S. Strategic Command did detect and tracked what we assessed was a North Korean submarine missile launch yesterday -- yesterday afternoon, Eastern Time. The launch of a presumed KN-11 submarine-launched ballistic missile occurred off the coast of Sinpo. The missile was tracked over and into the Sea of Japan approximately 300 miles off the coast of North Korea. And NORAD did conclude that the missile launch did not pose a threat to North America.\nSo I think from that detailed readout, I think it should be a pretty good indication to you and everybody else that this is something that we're watching closely. And we do continue to be concerned by the provocative destabilizing actions of the North Korean regime. We have, over the last year or so, been able to work more effectively with the Chinese government to apply additional pressure to the North Korean regime. You've heard me say on a number of occasions now that our ability to unite the international community -- not just our allies, but even some of our partners in this effort, like China -- to present a united front to North Korea and deepen their isolation will be critical to our ability to apply sufficient pressure to change their behavior. That hasn't happened yet. And we're going to continue to work cooperatively in a coordinated fashion with the Chinese to try to steadily ratchet up that pressure.\nAll of you have reported about the public comments of the Chinese raising some concerns about the deployment of THAAD to South Korea. This is a sophisticated anti-ballistic missile defense system that the United States has offered to our allies in South Korea, acknowledging the threat emanating from North Korea. We've made clear that this is a defense missile -- a ballistic missile defense system that would be oriented toward the threat in North Korea, and that's why we don't believe it should be a subject of concern of the Chinese. But they've indicated otherwise.\nWe believe this is a prudent step and it's something that our -- the deployment of the THAAD is a prudent step, and we've done it in consultation with our allies in South Korea. And I think the threat that they face is rather obvious to anybody who is paying attention. So we don't believe that it should impair our ability to continue to work with the rest of the international community, including China, to apply additional pressure to the North Korean regime.\nUltimately, China has their own vested interest in seeing North Korea cease and desist from these kinds of destabilizing actions. And it's on the basis of their own self-interest that we believe we can work together to apply additional pressure to North Korea and try and change the dynamic there. But that obviously hasn't happened yet.\nLet's move around. Andrew.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about what's going on in Kabul, and do you have any indication of whether there are Americans involved in this incident at the American University, and where there's a hostage situation going on?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any more granular detail than what I've already been able to provide. I would actually refer you to my colleagues at the State Department. I know that my colleagues at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul are obviously closely monitoring this situation, and they may be able to provide you some additional information, particularly as it relates to the status of Americans who may or may not be in harm's way.\nQ: And on Syria, what does this Turkish intervention in northern Syria mean for the U.S. relations with YPG and how they can work -- you've worked with them in the past in northeastern Turkey, where there seemed to be some tensions.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I alluded to in reference to Kathleen's questions -- and I know you've spent a lot of time covering this, Andrew, so you know this as well as anybody in this room -- that the kinds of tensions between the Kurdish population in the region of the world and the Turkish government are longstanding. And that's been part of the complexity that the United States and the rest of the international coalition has had to navigate in addressing the situation inside of Syria.\nWhat the United States has said is that the crux of our strategy will be supporting local forces on the ground in Syria who are committed to taking the fight to ISIL. And the United States has offered support to those forces on the ground who have taken the fight to ISIL. And that's the case that we have made to the Turks who have made no secret of their unease about this particular situation. But the fact is there have been diverse forces inside of Syria that, yes, include some Kurds, but also are Arabs and Turkmen and others who have been an effective fighting force against ISIL and have been responsible for significant gains on the ground inside of Syria.\nNow, those gains would not have been possible without equipping and advice and assistance that has been provided by the U.S.-led counter-ISIL coalition. That progress has been enhanced by air power that's been deployed by the United States and our coalition partners to support their efforts on the ground. And we're going to continue to support those unified forces as they go after ISIL.\nMike.\nQ: On the EpiPen question, just a couple of specific follow-ups. You talked about it in general in terms with Kathleen. Is the administration doing anything to review this price increase or look at what Mylan did?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific administration steps that are being contemplated at this point. But if any decisions -- regulatory decisions like that were going to be made, I assume they would come from HHS or FDA, or one of those agencies that has some more relevant authority. So you might check with them.\nQ: Does the President now regret signing the legislation that encourages schools to stock these EpiPens, which obviously gave the company more latitude to increase its prices by increasing demand?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware of any regret. The fact is, the medicine that is delivered through this equipment saves lives. And I think that's why some of the moral questions I alluded to before are raised in the context of these series of stories. But I'm not going to second-guess the specific pricing decisions of companies. They'll obviously have to make those kinds of decisions on their own. But there have been other pharmaceutical companies that have gotten a lot of unwanted attention for their pricing practices, and it certainly degrades their efforts to build a reputation for themselves as an organization that's committed to developing and providing lifesaving medicine.\nQ: Is the President at all concerned that the CEO behind this price increase is the daughter of a Democratic senator and that the company has benefitted from this legislation passed by the Senate in Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen some of those news reports. It's not clear to me now, at least, based only on what I've read in those news reports, that there's any correlation or any connection. But I assume that's something that you and your news organizations will be taking a look at.\nQ: And just lastly, on Syria, there's some reports out now that Assad maybe didn't turn over all the materials involved in chemical weapons reduction in Syria. Do you have any comment on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously this is something that the OPCW has been carefully looking at, and we believe that they should. What we were able to achieve a couple of years ago in getting the Assad regime to acknowledge that they had a significant quantity of chemical weapons, rounding up those chemicals and destroying them made the world safer. It eliminated a significant proliferation risk. When you have a country that is overrun by extremists, having large quantities of chemical weapons floating around is not a good idea and not a good combination.\nSo we've been pleased that the Assad regime's declared chemical weapons stockpile was rounded up and destroyed. But the situation in Syria has been murky for quite some time. We've also expressed our previous long-running concerns about the gratuitous violence that's used by the Assad regime against innocent civilians, including the weaponization of otherwise common chemicals to try to exacerbate the violence in that country. And I'm referring to chlorine, a commonly available industrial chemical that, according to some reports at least, the Assad regime is using as a weapon. And that is something that's of deep concern to the international community and certainly to the United States.\nMichelle.\nQ: There have been so many times that we've talked here about North Korean missile launch -- maybe no one knows exactly how many times it's come up. But what do you see as sort of the result of this? Sanctions and actions don't change behavior, so we know that is true. And the fact that we're talking about missile defense as being kind of the most important element here -- do you see North Korea just continuing in their technology, getting it better and better each time until they finally have a nuclear weapon? Or what do you sort of see the end being here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as it relates to the beginning of your question, Michelle, I think what is true is we have not seen the change in their behavior yet, and that's undeniable. But what's also true is we have been able to work effectively to steadily ramp up pressure and isolation on the North Korea regime, including those elements of the regime that are responsible for funding their ballistic missile program and for those elements of the regime that victimize their population. We've tried to focus our efforts to isolate the regime by trying to hit the elite where it hurts. And we know that despite the widespread suffering by the population in that country, there is a certain elite that benefits from access to some items of luxury, and we've made a concerted effort to try to clamp down on that. There's more work that we can do, and there's more work that we can do by coordinating effectively with our partners, including China, to address that and to apply additional pressure.\nBut I think one thing we do know is this is a strategy that has worked other places. Each country is different, and I'm the first person to assert that. But a strategy of isolation and sanctions and unifying the world community in the face of nuclear threat did actually succeed in preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and it did bring about the desired change in strategy and change in behavior in Iran when it comes to their nuclear program, at least, that we would like to see.\nThat, of course, did not eliminate the widespread concerns we have with other aspects of Iran's policies, including their support for terrorism. But the fact that the terrorists that they support are not going to be able to get nuclear weapons from the Iranian government I think is tangible progress, and progress that was realized not because of a military invasion or shots being fired, but because of an effective, skillful, tough diplomacy that united the international community, isolated Iran, compelled them to the negotiating table, and resulted in the kind of diplomatic agreement that has clear benefits for the United States.\nQ: So it sounds like you're saying that you foresee more sanctions down the road and that you have optimism that it will eventually change the --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what we have seen is that this is a strategy that has worked well in other places, but that's not immediately -- North Korea is a rather unique place, and it's not clear that it will work in exactly the same way. But it certainly is a way for us to apply additional pressure to the North Korean regime, send a very clear, unmistakable signal that the international community has significant concerns with their behavior, and set up a set of incentives to try to get them to change their behavior. But they haven't thus far.\nQ: Okay. And I think for plenty of people who hear about hack after hack after hack in the last year or so at a high level and often coming from suspected Russian state sources, it could seem like the U.S. is doing a pretty poor job at thwarting these. But we also know that the attempts on entities like the White House are, I don't know, hundreds of hacking attempts per day. So how would you assess how the U.S. is able to fend off these kinds of -- especially if they're going to be state-sponsored? And it seems like they just keep coming.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States has made important progress in strengthening our cybersecurity, and that's because the President has made it a priority. And we're actually in the midst of a process now that the President announced at the beginning of the year to examine what additional progress we can make in this area. I would say a significant source of disappointment has been a failure on the part of Congress to provide additional resources that could strengthen our cyber defenses, and it's Republicans in Congress who have been the chief obstacle to this progress.\nAnd you've heard me say many times that the President included a substantial, robust proposal in his budget to consider strengthening cybersecurity, and Republicans, for the first time in four decades, canceled the hearing to discuss the budget. So it's not just that they are unwilling to work with the administration to try to make progress in areas like cybersecurity. It's that they are refusing to even talk to the administration about how to make progress on cybersecurity. And that's rather disappointing, and I think it reflects an abdication of the responsibility of Republicans to govern, particularly when you're talking about something that shouldn't really be a source of political controversy like cybersecurity.\nSo the administration has made this a priority. The American people have benefitted from the administration making this a priority. But America is not in the strongest position as we can and should be because of Republicans in Congress refusing to do their job.\nQ: And when we talked about Turkey post-coup, you mentioned that there are some concerns about some of the actions that Turkey has taken. But would you -- do you have similar concerns around this extradition request for Gьlen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think our concerns about the Turkish government's activity since the coup have been a reflection of our longstanding concerns about protection of human rights inside of Turkey. Turkey is a valuable NATO ally, and we're able to work effectively with them on a variety of issues in a way that advances the interests of both our countries. But even in the midst of our progress in pursuit of those shared priorities, the President has periodically raised concerns directly with President Erdogan, particularly on issues like freedom of the press inside of Turkey.\nThat said, since the coup, we've understood the significant concerns that have been raised in Turkey and the need for a thorough investigation to get to the bottom of what exactly happened. And I know the Vice President had an opportunity to talk about this when he was in Turkey earlier today.\nSo as it relates to Mr. Gьlen, though, I think the situation there is a little bit different. There is a well-established process, and both the United States and Turkey are engaged in that process. That process is governed by an extradition treaty between the United States and Turkey that's been on the books for 35 years or so.\nQ: But is there anything about these -- and there have been multiple requests, and the fact that they're not -- the requests aren't related to the coup, directly, at least -- does anything about that bother you?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, some of this is related to the fact that there is a rather high bar, a high evidentiary standard that's required. So considering that the coup took place -- what was it -- six or eight weeks ago, I think it's understandable that Turkey wouldn't be able to build such a robust case, if there is one to be presented, against Mr. Gьlen in such a short period of time.\nBut Turkey has longstanding concerns with Mr. Gьlen's activity and they have presented significant evidence to the United States, and Department of Justice officials are carefully reviewing that evidence. In fact, Justice officials are in Turkey this week, meeting with their counterparts to discuss and review that evidence. What we have said all along is that the terms of the treaty and the law on the books here will ultimately determine how this is resolved.\nQ: So to use the word \"concern\" for maybe the millionth time, are you -- is there anything about this extradition request that concerns or bothers the administration?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, no, because, again, the Turks have asked us to engage in a process that's codified in this treaty. They've presented a lot of information and we are doing our due diligence to take their concerns seriously and to follow those guidelines in determining what the final disposition of the case should be.\nRon.\nQ: Just on the Kabul situation again. You said that you weren't sure if the President had been briefed, you think the shooting has stopped, and the coalition are assisting and advising. The reports there are suggesting that there are hundreds of people perhaps trapped at the school, that there was probably a significant American presence there because there's staff there, there was an American professor who was kidnapped a couple weeks ago. I'm just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of this situation. You sound like it's not -- I don't want to -- well, concerned -- but can you give me some sense of what you think the magnitude of this was?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think anytime we see innocent civilians, whether they're Americans or Afghans or other innocent people of any nationality in an international city like Kabul in harm's way, we're, of course, deeply concerned about that, and the security situation inside of Afghanistan is still one that is concerning. So it certainly is something that we're monitoring closely. But obviously it's hard to get accurate information in the midst of a dynamic situation like this.\nQ: But it's over now -- is that the --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no, I don't think it's over now. What I think has happened is that the shooting has stopped and that they're in the process of trying to rigorously clear this rather large facility.\nQ: U.S. and coalition forces never had to actually be engaged in the process -- they were advising? Because there were some reports that they were actually advising on the scene. Again, this whole idea of non-combat and -- well, not non-combat, but trying again to gauge the involvement of the American forces there. How involved were they in whatever clearing operations --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, at this point it's too early to tell. I don't want to hazard a guess at this point. This is a dynamic situation, but I'm confident that my colleagues at the Department of Defense, as we get a clearer sense about what exactly happened there, they can give you a better sense of how U.S. forces were involved -- if there were any U.S. forces. At this point, I'm not even sure if there are U.S. forces or other members of our coalition who were involved. But I can tell you that coalition forces were involved in a train and advise -- I'm sorry, in an advise and assist capacity as Afghan security forces were responding to that situation and clearing the facility.\nQ: And the earthquake in Italy -- the White House had nothing to say about that today, I don't think. That seemed like a fairly significant event -- 75 or so people killed at last count, I believe; an American ally. Why nothing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I can tell you that the President spoke by telephone today with President Sergio Mattarella of Italy to offer his deep condolences on behalf of the American people to the people of Italy following the devastating earthquake that struck overnight. President Obama saluted the quick action of first responders and volunteers who have been working to save lives, and the President used the occasion of the phone call to reaffirm the strong bonds of friendship between the United States and Italy.\nObviously, Italy is an important and valued partner and ally of the United States and there are obviously deep cultural ties. There are a lot of people in the United States that have family in Italy, and so I think there are a lot of people in the United States who are deeply concerned about the situation there. And our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Italy as they deal with this situation. We're certainly thinking about the families who have lost loved ones. And the status of a lot of people continues to remain in doubt, and that's deeply unsettling and a source of deep concern. And our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Italy right now. And I think Pope Francis had some quite poignant words to say today in offering some prayers for those who were affected by the earthquake, and I think his prayers are representative of people of all faiths around the world at this moment for the people of Italy.\nQ: You're not clear about -- sure yet about whether there were Americans involved there -- American military personnel in that country?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, this is obviously something that our diplomatic presence inside of Italy is very focused on. So I don't have an update on the status of any Americans at this point, but embassy officials in Italy and Rome are focused on this and are working hard to provide needed assistance to Americans who may have been affected by the earthquake in Italy.\nQ: And lastly, on this issue of the Clinton Foundation and the State Department, now, I don't want to argue the detail, the minutiae of it so much as I just want to --\nMR. EARNEST: Neither do I. (Laughter.)\nQ: I didn't think so. (Laughter.) That's why I tried to make this -- but as a bottom line, is the President -- what is the President's view of whether there was adequate separation, rules followed, whatever the question is, during the Secretary's tenure at the State Department between State Department and the Clinton Foundation? Was there a concern about a melding of the two entities? Was there an adequate separation or firewall between them? Is the President satisfied that all the rules were followed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think in order to draw a final assessment like you're asking for requires a detailed understanding of the minutia that, frankly, I don't have. But what I can tell you are a couple of things. The first is before Secretary Clinton even started her service as Secretary of State, there was a memorandum of understanding that was signed by Secretary Clinton and by a senior representative here at the White House to ensure that the ethics requirements that are in place went above and beyond those guidelines that are set by law.\nAnd I think that's an indication of just how seriously the President takes these issues. And he's quite proud of the record of his administration writ large. And this observation has been made by some of you about how -- the way that President Obama and his team have chosen to run the federal government over the last eight years I think is a testament to the President's commitment to good government and competence and ethics in government. And the President is quite proud of that record and, frankly, is ready to set that record up against anybody who wants to compare it to previous administrations. So he's quite proud of it.\nAnd he's also quite proud of the work that Secretary Clinton did while she was at the State Department. She served the President and the country quite well in that job. And you've heard the President speak on many occasions about what an excellent job he thinks that she did in that role.\nQ: So the fact that a significant number of donors also had access or meetings with the Secretary is not a concern, or is a concern, or how should we interpret that? How does the President --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are lots of different ways to interpret it. I know that one of the names that's been thrown about is Melinda Gates, and she's obviously somebody who is at the top of a large foundation that's doing valuable work around the world. And I don't think it's particular surprising that she might have relevant business before the Secretary of State, and that by the two of them coordinating, the interest of the country and the interest of the world could be advanced.\nSo, look, I'll let -- I know all of you are closely covering this story, as you should, and the American people will ultimately consider the facts and draw their own conclusions about these kinds of questions.\nQ: So this is politics?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't describe --\nQ: Or is there something now that the President wants looked at more closely?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is certainly clear is that there are critics and organizations who are looking for an opportunity to score some political points, but we're also three months away from an election. So I think, again, the American people will have to sift through all this and draw their own conclusions. I think when you consider the President's point of view, the President's view is he has made ethics in government and competence in government a high priority, as he promised to do when he was running for this office, and he is quite proud that he and his administration have delivered on that promise. And he's proud to put this administration's record up against any other in reaching that assessment.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, on Italy, is the U.S. offering any assistance in earthquake relief?\nMR. EARNEST: Mark, I can tell you that in his phone call with President Mattarella, the President did -- President Obama did offer U.S. assistance to the Italians as they respond to this situation. Unfortunately, the Italian government has an expertise in responding to earthquake situations like this. This is a region of the world that is rather prone to earthquakes. So it is not clear to me at this point that any of those offers have been taken up, but that, frankly, is a testament to the expertise of the Italians in responding to situations like this.\nBut if our friends in Italy need our help, particularly dealing with a situation like this, you can rest assured that we're going to provide it.\nQ: Is there any White House reaction to the CBO report yesterday projecting a significant increase in the deficit this year, and in the out-years, projecting that the deficit could reach a trillion dollars in eight years?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, we'll get you a more detailed response. My understanding is that a lot of the changes in that analysis were actually a result of different projections about future interest rates. So I know that affected the numbers. But I think what President Obama has acknowledged throughout his tenure in office is that we need to be focused on the fiscal situation in this country, and the President is quite proud of the record under his tenure in office of reducing our deficit by about three-quarters. And that's an indication that we have things moving in the right direction.\nBut it's clear that as the population in the United States ages that there are additional steps that we're going to need to take. And that could include additional steps to reform the health care system in this country that is certainly increasing in cost. But it's also going to require Democrats and Republicans working together more effectively. And there hasn't been a lot of cooperation on the part of Republicans from working with the administration to try to get this done.\nI'm also confident that a bunch of those numbers were not aided by the significant tax cuts that were passed by the Republican Congress at the end of last year that primarily benefitted wealthy corporations. So there's certainly a lot of money that can be saved, and this will be a challenge that the next President and the next Congress will have to do. But there's no denying the important progress that we made on our fiscal situation in this country under President Obama's leadership.\nQ: One last item. I wanted to follow up on the exchange Monday about access to the President at fundraising events. Some of those fundraiser statements that he makes are open to press coverage of either print pool or, on rare occasions, the entire press pool. Is there any reconsideration by the President to allow coverage of his Q&A with donors at fundraisers, which is always -- we've always been barred from?\nMR. EARNEST: I know that there have been situations where the press corps has been included in the President taking Q&A with groups of people. I know the last couple of times --\nQ: Not fundraisers.\nMR. EARNEST: Not fundraisers, that's right, but on occasions where the President, for example, is doing Q&A with governors when the National Governors Association has been here. I know that there was a rather remarkable event early in the presidency where the President was doing Q&A with members of the House Republican Conference.\nQ: Very early.\nMR. EARNEST: That event got a lot of attention.\nQ: And he didn't repeat it. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I suspect that the reason that that hasn't happened again wasn't a decision made by the White House, but rather a decision made by congressional Republicans, who I don't think felt like they came away looking too good in that exchange. But you can check with them on that. It's probably been a while since the President has been invited to that meeting, so that may also affect access there, too.\nBut, look, as a matter of -- when it comes to the matter of the President's fundraisers, our policy is a good one in terms of providing access to a representative of the White House press corps, or a handful of representatives in the form of the print pool, to observe the President and hear the case that the President is making even when he's making that pitch to small groups of donors in a private house. And that kind of transparency goes beyond what just about every other President in the modern era has allowed.\nBut I certainly would expect, Mark, you and your colleagues to be angling for more and you should. I don't anticipate a change in our policy across the board, but, look, we'll see what happens. Maybe there will be a time when we just decide to open it up just for fun.\nQ: Maybe?\nMR. EARNEST: Maybe.\nQ: Just for fun?\nMR. EARNEST: Just for fun. Exactly. (Laughter.)\nPhil.\nQ: Thank you. Vice President Biden is meeting with Turkish President Erdogan right now in Turkey. And here's a quote from the Vice President about the four extradition requests that now exist for Fethullah Gьlen. He says this: \"God willing, there will be enough evidence,\" concerning the extradition requests for Fethullah Gьlen. Is that the point of view of the administration right now, that \"God willing,\" there is enough evidence to be able to extradite Gьlen to Turkey?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the point that the Vice President was making is that this is not going to be a decision that is made by the executive branch. The decision about the evidence that Turkey has compiled is one that will follow the guidelines of the extradition treaty, and will ultimately involve a federal judge who will have to render their own judgment, their own assessment of the situation consistent with U.S. law and consistent with the terms of the extradition treaty. I think that's the point that Vice President Biden was making.\nQ: Isn't he going a little bit too far here? If you're saying this is in the hands of DOJ officials and the DOJ and a judge, eventually, someone from the executive should not really try and influence the judicial branch should they, like he seems to have been doing in Turkey?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think Vice President Biden has been -- somebody who has served on the Senate Judiciary Committee and certainly has been involved in making foreign policy in this country for several decades -- understands that those kinds of decisions and those kinds of determinations will be made independent of any preference or any other public comments, frankly, from anybody else.\nThose decisions about the evidence that's presented and whether they meet the evidentiary standard included in U.S. law, and whether or not they meet the evidentiary standard included in the extradition treaty -- the officials at the Department of Justice and, ultimately, if it comes to it, a federal judge -- those are decisions that will be made by the book and based on the merits and based on these well-established guidelines, not based on the public comments from, frankly, anybody else.\nQ: On this subject, there's been plenty of contact between Presidents Erdogan and Obama. Has there been any contact between the White House and Mr. Gьlen and his associates?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any contact like that. But why don't I check and see if there's a better way that -- if we can go beyond just my own personal knowledge and see if there's additional insight we can provide to you.\nJohn.\nQ: I had a couple of quick follow-ups. Beyond Italy, has the President been in touch with anybody from Myanmar? I know there was a big quake there, as well. And any assistance?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the United States is monitoring developments from the earthquake that hit North Central Burma. We're still gathering information on the event, and we'll stay in close touch with the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon and the government of Burma, and other humanitarian partners in the country.\nAt this point, we're not aware of any U.S. casualties from that incident, but the embassy is working -- the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon is working to verify the welfare and whereabouts of U.S. citizens in the area at the time of the earthquake. And the U.S. Embassy there stands ready to provide any necessary consular assistance.\nI can tell you that the United States government has been in touch with the Burmese government about this situation. But the details about what exactly the impact of the earthquake has been on the region are still a little unclear. But we will continue to remain in touch with the Burmese government moving forward.\nQ: On Monday, you reiterated that President Obama hopes to close Guantanamo Bay Prison by the end of the administration. Yesterday, Abu Zubaydah had his first hearing where he's appeared in public really since he's been there to review his status and whether he's eligible for transfer. Does the President intend to transfer 100 percent of the population that remains there to other foreign countries? Or does the President still hope to bring some of them back into the United States and hold them here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, at this point, there are 61 detainees that remain confined at the prison at Guantanamo Bay. And as of this morning, only 20 of them had been approved for transfer at this point. There is a rigorous process of evaluating the individual cases, and this process is conducted by a review board where there are representatives of a variety of national intelligence and national security agencies who consider these individual cases. And as the name of the board suggests, they periodically review the files to determine if they are suitable for transfer to another country under a set of specific conditions and restrictions.\nAt this point, only 20 of the 61 who are currently there have been approved for transfer. Now, there's still an important step here, which is that we still have to go and do some diplomatic work with other countries to determine who's willing to assume responsibility for these individuals and who's also willing to assist with the implementation of whatever restrictions may be necessary against them after they're transferred. So there's still a lot of diplomatic work that needs to be done.\nWhat I can tell you is that the Obama administration will not transfer to other countries individuals that have not been cleared for transfer. There's a reason that we've set up this process, and the President intends to follow it.\nQ: And then another quick follow-up from Monday. When talking about the Iran payment, you really stressed that this was three separate deals -- the payment, the prisoner exchange, and then the Iran nuclear deal. One question I had, if you could explicitly answer --\nMR. EARNEST: I'll try.\nQ: -- is, would each of those deals [have] stood on their own merit? Because you've pretty much stressed that they weren't contingent on each other. I'm just curious, can you explicitly say that they would have each stood on their own?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. I think on the merits, each of them considered in isolation was a good deal for the United States and advanced our interests. So I would be confident in saying that, yes.\nQ: And then my final question is just do you think that the Republicans and Democratic nominee should be more transparent in their health records and releasing their medical history?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not going to provide advice to the campaigns. There are plenty of skilled professionals who are working on both sides to make their own determinations about what they should do.\nThe President is taking seriously the responsibility he had, both as a candidate and as President, to communicate periodically with the American public about his health. And we've periodically provided detailed letters from the President's physician to describe the President's health. And we believe that -- the President did that not because he was eager for all of you to keep tabs on his efforts to quit smoking, for example, but we've done that because the President feels a responsibility to disclose to the American people the health and well-being of the person that was elected to lead the country.\nSo the President believes as a matter of principle that that's important. But as it relates to the individual candidates and how much information they should provide, obviously they're going to have to decide that for themselves.\nScott.\nQ: Josh, there were some objections in Maine to the designation of the national monument there. Can you describe why --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Scott, I can tell you that the administration worked very closely with officials in Maine both to reach this determination, and to make sure that the concerns that were raised by Mainers in the area were addressed. And I would single out Senator Angus King as somebody who was a very skillful advocate for the people of Maine both in considering this proposal from the administration and ensuring that the concerns and preferences that were expressed by the people of Maine were manifested in the final decision. And I think you saw the statement from Senator King earlier today indicating his support for the President moving forward in this way.\nSo the President was quite proud that this piece of beautiful land in the United States will be protected for generations to come, and that future generations of Americans and future generations of Mainers will be able to enjoy it, and will be able to fish in those waters and camp on those grounds and hike through those mountains and enjoy one of the more picturesque parts of America.\nQ: Can you give me an example of what kinds of things you did to address the local concerns?\nMR. EARNEST: We can follow up with you with some specific examples of that, but I know that as this process moved forward there were specific instances where Mainers said -- where local communities or local citizens said that there's one aspect of the proposal they'd like to see implemented differently. And Senator King played a valuable role in serving as an advocate for the people of Maine in making sure that the final proposal reflects the preferences and interests of the people who live in that area.\nMark.\nQ: Yes, Josh, can we get back to Syria --\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: -- just one more time?\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: Admittedly, the complexity of the situation and the number of parties involved, but my question is a pretty straightforward one. We have -- the Turks are our allies, they're our NATO allies.\nMR. EARNEST: That's right.\nQ: The Kurds are our allies. Did we say to the Turks, did the administration specifically say ahead of time to the Turks, do not attack this Kurdish group which is working with us? Similarly, did we say to that Kurdish group, the Turks are coming, you'd better pull back across the river and get out of the way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is true, Mark, is, given the complexity of the situation there, we certainly do not want to see partners of the United States in conflict with one another.\nNow, I think that it's possible you may be conflating two different regions of the country. There had been one region in northeastern Syria where Kurds had been in a skirmish with Assad forces, and then there was another region in northwestern Syria where there has been some U.S.-backed forces that do include Kurds making progress and eventually clearing ISIL out of Manbij, which is close to Jarabulus, where the Turkish activity is taking place.\nSo it's a complex situation on the ground. So I think to try to answer your question as directly as I can, we certainly do encourage those entities and organizations and forces that have been effective in working with the United States and our coalition in going after ISIL to not fight each other. That would just be counterproductive. And we certainly have tried to use the role that we're playing in leading this coalition and using our influence with a variety of groups to try to prevent or to try to de-conflict those kinds of activities. But as you point out, it's tricky business.\nQ: It sounds like a yes, though, that you have been urging both sides to keep -- steer clear of each other.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think we certainly want to do everything we can to prevent a confrontation from two different groups or a variety of groups that we've found to be effective partners. That certainly is true. I guess the point is I don't think we've come to a place where they've actually come into conflict. There's not been a situation where that's happened at this point. And, yes, some of that is because of planning that we have executed to try to prevent those forces from coming into conflict.\nUltimately, it is our view that interests are converging. There is an interest that Turkey and the Kurds and the United States and other forces on the ground have in driving ISIL out of this entire region. There is an obvious interest that the Turks have in more effectively sealing the border between Turkey and Syria -- particularly in light of the terrible terrorist attack that we saw in southern Syria just over the weekend.\nAnd it's also understandable that the diverse set of Syrian Democratic Forces that are operating in northwestern Syria have in focusing their efforts on ISIL. And we're hopeful that that's what they'll continue to do.\nConnie.\nQ: Thank you. In all these horrible natural disasters, the United States leads the way in both financial and humanitarian aid. Are you calling on the rest of the world, for the U.N. to chip in more, their fair share in relief -- Myanmar, every place else there were natural disasters?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, we're still assessing exactly what the impact of the earthquake in Burma has been. But if there is a need for the international community to mobilize resources to try to meet the needs of those who are directly affected, then the United States will play the leading role that we often have and we'll certainly use our influence to encourage other countries around the world to step up to the plate and assist, as well.\nQ: How do you prioritize which natural disaster you deal with first? How do you keep your sanity, if you have kept your sanity?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, fortunately, there are experts in disaster recovery who work at places like USAID that are used to operating in very difficult environments to try to bring relief to human suffering. And we're certainly going to be relying on their expertise a lot in the weeks ahead.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Where is the U.S.-Turkey relationship right now? I think it would be too rosy to suggest it's perfect. I think it might be over pessimistic to say it's completely strained. And yet, given the Vice President's visit there, where is the relationship right now? Is it overstating it to say that it is fraying?\nMR. EARNEST: I do think that's overstating it. I think I would say that the U.S.-Turkey relationship continues to be strong. And the United States and Turkey are able to coordinate quite effectively to counter interests -- or to counter threats to our shared interests. And the fact that right now you have Turkish military forces that are moving against ISIL forces along their border, and that they're doing so with the strong military support of the United States and our coalition partners I think is the best illustration you could imagine of that.\nWhat's also true is that our diplomatic relationship is valuable, as well. And that's one of the reasons that Vice President Biden is visiting Turkey today is to reiterate the United States' strong support for the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey. That government was threatened by an attempted military coup just a month or two ago. And it's important for the people of Turkey and for the government of Turkey to understand that the most influential democracy in the world, here in the United States, is strongly supportive of their democracy.\nQ: But the way you just put that makes it sound great, perfect, outstanding, all smooth sailing. I don't think that's true.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't mean to leave you with that impression. We obviously have -- look, the fact that we have been encouraging the Turks for more than a year now to take more action along their border I think is an indication that we haven't gotten everything that we wanted. But the fact that they're doing it now I think is an indication that our relationship continues to strengthen and that areas of common interest are coming into clearer focus. And the fact that there are U.S. military personnel that are stationed inside of Turkey right now using Turkish military facilities to carry out attacks against ISIL I think is another good illustration of our converging interests and our ability to work together to advance them.\nBut, look, anytime that the United States is dealing with another democracy, we'll be interacting with a country that has a diverse set of views. That's not just true in Turkey; that's true in the UK, a country with whom we have a special relationship. So I don't think there's any country in the world where we would say that everything is perfect, but I think there are a lot of countries in the world where we would say that our relationship is much better under President Obama's leadership because of his commitment to investing in those kinds of relationships. And that certainly is true when it comes to our NATO allies.\nQ: Any concern about Erdogan's outreach toward Vladimir Putin?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no. I think you would obviously expect that Turkey would have relationships with important countries around the world -- not just the United States, but also with Russia. And so I wouldn't expect the United States to be concerned when President Erdogan sits down with President Putin any more so than I would expect President Erdogan to be concerned when President Obama picks up the phone and calls President Putin himself.\nQ: I want to follow up on a question Ron was asking about. Let me see how I want to put this. When we talk about the Clinton Foundation and the sort of intertwined, or at least what the AP has suggested sort of is intertwine of interests, where people who are having conversations -- over 50 percent of the people with whom she had private sector conversations were people who were donating to the foundation itself -- it seems like at least at first blanch that there may have been pay for play. That's been the criticism by some. Not everyone. And they've pushed back -- the campaign certainly has. And so my question to you is, is this time now for a special prosecutor to take a look at some of the allegations that have been raised, in particular in this latest AP report, which seems to suggest that there may have been some malfeasance, or at least some intertwine between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I can tell you that President Obama and the administration have complete confidence in the independent career prosecutors at the Department of Justice and the FBI who devoted significant time and attention to investigating Secretary Clinton's email practices. That was work they did without any sort of political interference. These are dedicated professionals -- I don't think anybody would call into question the political independence of somebody like FBI Director Comey. He's somebody who served in a senior position in the Bush administration, for goodness sake.\nQ: I don't think, though, asking for a special prosecutor is somehow impugning the integrity of the people over at DOJ, do you?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think some people have raised it in that way. They've suggested that somehow the FBI investigation was not sufficient and, therefore, some additional investigative work may be required.\nLook, I think Director Comey himself is somebody who has also demonstrated not just a commitment to nonpartisanship in preventing politics from interfering in this official responsibilities, he's also demonstrated I think a rather remarkable commitment to transparency himself. He's somebody who gave an extraordinary public statement when announcing the findings of their investigation. He's somebody who went to Congress and testified under oath for four or five hours in explaining the conclusions that were reached by his investigation. And I also understand -- and I know this based on published reports, and you can check the details with the FBI -- but I understand that they've also provided written materials about that investigation to Congress.\nSo it's clear that the investigation has been thorough, professional, unfettered by politics, even in a highly charged political atmosphere. And I think that's a testament to the work of Director Comey and the professionals at the Department of Justice and the FBI. I just think it's hard for anybody to make a very persuasive case that somehow there hasn't been enough investigating, particularly when you layer on top of that all of the congressional hearings and testimony that's gone on with regard to Secretary Clinton's tenure at the State Department.\nQ: Last one I have for you. Are you familiar with this report that the State Department made -- 13 payments from Treasury -- one sent below $100 million -- in making the payments to Iran? Are you familiar with that report? And if that is true, it sounds like a bit like structuring. And I don't want to draw the direct comparison to what happened to former Speaker Hastert, but I do think it begs the question, does that strike you as odd that that is what happened?\nMR. EARNEST: No, it's not odd. It's my understanding that this is essentially the way that these funds are administered out of that account. But this is the payment from the judgment fund to Iran for the $1.3 billion in interest for the $400 million that was held in that U.S. military account since 1979. So that's what those numbers reflect, are those payments. And the Treasury Department may be able to provide you some additional information about the mechanics here, but ultimately that's just a reflection of the way that the money is drawn from that bank account.\nJane.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. The THAAD missile deployment issue. China continues to oppose the program of the THAAD in South Korea. China is not (inaudible) for pressure on North Korea. What is the U.S. -- do you have any idea to convincing Chinese government for (inaudible) against South Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, we're going to continue to engage in diplomacy with our Chinese counterparts. And you've heard a number of Chinese officials, including President Xi and President Hu before him, expressing significant concerns with the behavior of the North Korean regime, including their development of a ballistic missile program that is inconsistent with U.N. Security Council resolutions and their international obligations.\nSo I think that point that I would make is China has their own vested interest in confronted this situation. They've indicated as much. And that's why the United States and China have been able to work effectively to further isolate North Korea.\nAs I acknowledged to Michelle, that isolation and the steps that we have taken to further that isolation have not yet had the desired effect. But I'm confident in saying that the North Korean regime is aware that the international community is united and resolved to deal with the situation, to deescalate the situation on the Korean Peninsula, and to lower the tension, and certainly bring everyone into compliance, particularly the North Koreans, with their international obligations when it comes to both a ballistic missile program and nuclear weapons.\nQ: The leader of North Korea yesterday said (inaudible) sanctions now ongoing. But what does the U.S. have -- any strong sanctions against the North Korea? Do you have anything else?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly don't have anything to announce at this point. But obviously the United States does have significant sanctions in place against North Korea because of their repeated violation of their international obligations when it comes to their ballistic missile program, and I would not in any way take off the table the idea of additional sanctions. But I don't have anything more to preview for you as it relates to potential sanctions activity.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois recently said that President Obama was acting like the drug dealer-in-chief with respect to the payment -- the $400 million to Iran. Is the President aware of that statement? And does the White House have a response?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, this is not the first that we've heard that kind of rhetoric from Senator Kirk. And I don't think that kind of rhetoric is consistent with the views of most people in Illinois about the efforts of President Obama to advance our interests around the world and prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nSo I know there's a temptation, particularly for those politicians that are on the ballot, to say outrageous things to try to get attention. But that's certainly no way to run a country, and it's certainly no way to confront issues that are as important as preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, securing the safe return of U.S. Americans that are detained unjustly overseas, and settling a 35-year-old financial dispute with an adversary of the United States in a way that saves taxpayers potentially billions of dollars.\nChris, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Great. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton yesterday filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration's regulation under Obamacare prohibiting discrimination against transgender people and health care. By my account, this is the third lawsuit that the Texas Attorney General has filed against an initiative from the administration on behalf of LGBT rights. Is that a source of frustration for President Obama?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, obviously the administration vigorously disagrees with many of the arguments that Attorney General Paxton has put forward. The administration has repeated acted responsibly to try to answer questions that have been raised as school districts and other organizations navigate the complexities of establishing policies in this field.\nSo my colleagues at the Department of Justice have obviously been making a forceful argument in the courts, and they'll continue to do so. And they'll do so rooted in the standing that the Obama administration and the executive branch has in the law. And the President has made clear that he's determined to use that authority to make the country more just, make the country more fair, to protect the rights of every American, and to protect the safety and security of every American -- not just LGBT Americans, but also straight Americans. And that's consistent with the policymaking that's taking place inside this administration, and that's why we continue to be confident in the power of the arguments that we'll make in a court of law.\nQ: You say the administration vigorously disagrees with Paxton over his lawsuits, but do you that they are politically motivated?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I won't speak to the motivation of the Texas Attorney General. We'll have an argument on the merits, and we feel confident in our ability to win those arguments.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:55 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-08-24", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119230", "text": "Today, Hillary Clinton issued the following statement on Mylan Pharmaceuticals and their recent price hike on EpiPens:\n\"Millions of Americans with severe allergies rely on their EpiPens. When an allergic reaction leads to anaphylactic shock, a shot of epinephrine can literally be the difference between life and death. But now, just as parents are about to send kids with severe food and insect allergies back to school, the EpiPen's manufacturer is hiking its price to an all-time high.\n\"Over the last several years, Mylan Pharmaceuticals has increased the price of EpiPens by more than 400%. They're now charging up to $600 for a two-EpiPen set that must be replaced every 12-18 months. This both increases out-of-pocket costs for families and first responders, and contributes to higher premiums for all Americans and their employers.\n\"That's outrageous – and it's just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers. I believe that our pharmaceutical and biotech industries can be an incredible source of American innovation, giving us revolutionary treatments for debilitating diseases. But it's wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them.\n\"That's why I've put forward a plan to address exorbitant drug price hikes like these. As part of my plan, I've made clear that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be required to explain significant price increases, and prove that any additional costs are linked to additional patient benefits and better value. Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens.\n\"In addition, when it comes to treatments like delivering epinephrine that have been available for decades, my plan encourages the production of alternative products. That's how we can harness the power of competition to keep drug prices at a level that all Americans can afford.\"", "timestamp": "2016-08-24", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on EpiPen Pricing"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119374", "text": "Today, Hillary Clinton released the following statement on her plans to bolster America's public health infrastructure to deal with the new challenges facing our communities and our families, including a new Public Health Rapid Response Fund to better respond to public health emergencies. Throughout her campaign, Clinton has been outspoken about the need for Congress to respond to the Zika epidemic. And two weeks ago, she visited a medical center in Miami that has been treating Zika patients to learn more about what we can be doing:\n\"The United States faces new threats to public health, from pandemic diseases like those caused by the Ebola and the Zika viruses, to the risk of biological weapons and bioterrorism, to long-term challenges like more extreme weather and expanding ranges for Lyme disease and water-borne illnesses as a result of climate change. And in a global economy, diseases like SARS, MERS, and avian influenza cannot be contained in their countries of origin.\n\"But despite these threats, we are not investing in public health preparedness and emergency response the way we should to keep our families and communities safe. A 2015 study found that spending on public health had fallen more than 9 percent since 2008. And uncertain long-term budgets leave our public health agencies dependent on emergency appropriations—meaning that when Congress fails to step up, communities are left without the resources they need, vaccines languish in development, and more people get sick.\n\"That is why as President, I will create a Public Health Rapid Response Fund, with consistent, year-to-year budgets, to better enable the CDC, HHS, FEMA, state and local public health departments, hospital systems, and other federal agencies to quickly and aggressively respond to major public health crises and pandemics. I will also ensure that our government has strong leadership and is organized to better support and work with people on the ground facing public health challenges. Doctors and public health experts have been warning for months that the Zika virus was likely to reach the continental United States, but Congress has failed to pass the President's emergency funding request. As a result, the Zika virus has gained a foothold in Miami, and 196 people have already been infected in the city—infections that may have been preventable.\n\"In addition, we need to do more to boost our preparedness for biological threats and bioweapons; to support research for new diagnostic tests, therapeutic treatments, and vaccines for emerging diseases; to build capacity in public health departments; to train the next cadre of public health professionals and ensure that public health and environmental health practices are standard to the educations of medical students; and to provide resources for states and local governments to plan for complex, multi-faceted public health threats, like the impacts of climate change, and build more resilient communities.\"", "timestamp": "2016-08-24", "title": "Hillary Clinton Proposes Rapid Response Fund to Fight Pandemics, Bolster America's Public Health Infrastructure"}

{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121170", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: I've been told by the Prime Minister that he'd like me to speak first. I want to thank him for his hospitality and say good afternoon to everyone.\nI've been to Turkey many times as a United States senator, going all the way back to the 1970s, as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and as Vice President. But I'm saddened to be back in Turkey today in the sense that I'm saddened that -- of the unconscionable attack that took place in an attempt to bring down Turkish democracy.\nWhat a lot of people around the world also failed to focus on is part of that attempt was also to attempt to assassinate the President and the Prime Minister. This was a fulsome attack on Turkey and its democratic institutions.\nSo, Mr. Prime Minister, President Obama asked me to come to Turkey today in order to remind the world of the paramount importance that we place on the relationship between our nations as allies, as partners, and as friends.\nIt is as an ally and a long-term friend of the Turkish people that I'm here today to express in no uncertain terms the continuing, unwavering support of the United States for Turkey in the wake of last month's attempted coup.\nAs I reiterated to the Prime Minister, we are available and ready to provide any assistance that the Turkish government or Turkish people need -- if any -- as they continue to move forward, as they reassert and strengthen their democracy.\nThe United States immediately condemned the tragic events on July the 15th. President Obama was one of the first world leaders to speak out in support of the Turkish government, even while the coup was still unfolding. I remember at the time when he and I heard the news, we weren't sure whether it was real or whether it was some concoction made up on the Internet and the Web. I'm serious. It was so startling.\nMy only regret that the whole world could not have been with me today as I visited your parliament, Mr. Prime Minister. Walls pockmarked with bullet holes. Twisted rebar and pipes and concrete rubble on the floor. Steel beams jutting out of the ceiling. Shattered glass strewn everywhere. As a matter of fact, I walked up to your office. Thank God you were not there. No, thank God you were not there. It is in ruins.\nThe bombs left behind a shell of what once stood, scarred by the betrayal striking at the heart of Turkish democracy. Had they hit at a slightly different place, even just a few meters away -- whether the jets firing or the helicopters riddling the parliament with gunfire -- had they hit just a few meters away, God only knows how many more lives would have been lost -- including a number of the parliamentarians.\nAnd your insistence that you go back in, your speaker of the parliament's insistence that you assemble in the parliament while the coup was taking place is evidence of your collective courage and determination.\nOf course, it's not just the parliament building that was scarred by this betrayal. It was the hearts of the people of Turkey and their most basic sense of security that was put in jeopardy. And they bear the scars, as well -- not just those who were injured and killed, but all the people of Turkey.\nBut the whole world watched as the President, bravely coming back to the capital, went on the air, as I understand, through a cell phone being recorded and asked the Turkish people to take back their government. They came together in unity to say, no, this will not be allowed to happen here in Turkey. We will defend our democratic institutions. Nothing will take us down.\nThat resolve was there for the whole world to see. The United States was shocked at the violation of the fundamental democratic principles that both our nations cherish. But we were also awed by the bravery of the Turkish people who literally stood in front of tanks -- some at great personal risk, and some actually run over by those tanks -- to defend your democracy.\nAs you would say in this region, they were martyrs. We would say they were great heroes and patriots, literally giving their lives for their country.\nSo on behalf of President Obama and the people of the United States, I want to once again, Mr. Prime Minister, extend to all the people of Turkey our condolences to the families and loved ones who were injured, but particularly those who lost a loved one. We pay tribute to not only their bravery but their incredible resolve, their incredible commitment to their democracy, to ensuring that their country remains strong, vibrant and resilient, and democratic.\nWe honor those that made the ultimate sacrifice. And I'm confident -- because I know you -- they will never be forgotten in the annals of Turkish history.\nLet me be clear, as clear as I possibly can: I want to ease any speculation, some of which I have heard, as to whether or not the United States had some advance warning, the United States had some foreknowledge, the United States had some complicity. The United States of America did not -- did not -- have any foreknowledge of what befell you on the 15th.\nThe United States of America, the people of the United States of America abhor what happened, and under no circumstances would support anything remotely approaching the cowardly act of the treasonous members of your military who engaged in this behavior. We did not have prior knowledge. We did not support. We immediately condemned. And we continue, as we did before the coup, to stand shoulder to shoulder with not only the government of Turkey, but with the people of Turkey.\nThe people of Turkey have no greater friend -- if you'll excuse me for being so self-serving -- have no greater friend than the United States of America. Let me say it again: You have no greater friend than the United States of America.\nWe've seen that borne out each time we stand together, face down threats to our shared security and our common values. And the United States government is committed to do everything we can to help your government, Mr. Prime Minister, to bring those to justice who are responsible for the coup attempt, while adhering to the rule of law, which is the foundation of both our societies.\nLet me say publicly the same thing I said privately to the Prime Minister: Gulen -- Mr. Prime Minister, I understand the intense feeling your government and the people of Turkey have about him. We are cooperating. We are cooperating with Turkish authorities. Our legal experts are working right now with their Turkish counterparts on the production of and the evaluation of material and evidence that needs to be supplied to an American court to meet the requirements under our law and the extradition treaty to extradite Gulen.\nAnd we're going to continue to do so as you continue to bring forward additional information. We have no -- no, no, no interest whatsoever in protecting anyone who has done harm to an ally. None. But we need to meet the legal standard requirement under our law.\nI should make clear under American law: No President of the United States has authority to extradite anyone on his own power. That only an American court can do that. Were a President to attempt to do that, it would be an impeachable offense. But we have no reason to do anything other than cooperate with you and take every substantiating fact and make it available to the extend it exists to an American court.\nIt always takes time, and quite frankly, it's never understood by your people or our people. It's never understood why the wheels of justice move deliberately and slowly. And it's totally understandable why the people of Turkey are angry. But there should be no doubt that we will continue to work closely with the Turkish government as this process unfolds. And if the pain of the attempted coup were not enough for any one nation to have to tolerate, the people of Turkey shortly thereafter continued to suffer unconscionable and barbaric acts of terrorism.\nIn the most recent attack, ISIL targeted a wedding where more than 50 were killed, including 29 children under the age of 18. It's not only heartbreaking, it's barbaric. It's inhumane. And this is not the first such heinous attack to take place on your soil, either at the hands of ISIL or the PKK.\nThe PKK has spread destruction in southeast Turkey on at least three occasions, doing major damage, ruining lives and property in an attempt to intimidate. The United States condemns these cowardly acts unequivocally.\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, and to your colleagues, no two losses are the same. But we understand. We understand. America has been the victim, as well -- not just 9/11, but recently, this year. We understand. And our hearts go out to you.\nSo I want to offer not only my condolences to the loved ones of those who were killed and injured in the string of recent terrorist attacks, but I also want to offer my condolences to all of your countrymen who have suffered so much from those who seek to impose their will through violence -- whether it's ISIL or Daesh or the PKK, or any other organization devoted to terror. They will not, they cannot, they must not succeed. Their entire purpose is to undermine everything we believe in. Their entire purpose is to get us to change who we are. We can never and we will never let that happen.\nThe people of Turkey, like the American people, do not cower in the face of threats or terror. We do not bend. We do not bow. And we are resilient.\nThat's the other reason why I'm here, Mr. Prime Minister, because we will stand together to defend our nations against those who seek to undermine our democracies of our great elective governments. We continue to fight together against ISIL in Syria and Iraq.\nToday, the Prime Minister and I spoke about the progress we've been making to defeat these terrorists. And I thanked him for how quickly Turkey resumed its counter-ISIL operations after the attempted coup. It's an important statement of our unwavering commitment to destroying ISIL as an evil in the world.\nIncirlik remains a lynchpin for coalition forces to keep hammering and degrading ISIL in Syria from the air. And our work together to train and equip Syrian opposition forces is increasing the effectiveness of local forces fighting ISIL on the ground. And we continue working toward a permanent political solution to the conflict in Syria.\nMr. Prime Minister, I want to thank you and thank your government for the incredible generosity that you continue to show to more than 3 million refugees -- 3 million refugees who fled the violence and conflict in Syria and Iraq, an enormous burden for your country to shoulder.\nWe also spoke about how the United States and Turkey can continue to support Cypriot leaders as they work to conclude an agreement this year hopefully that will reunify the island in a bizonal, bicommunal federation. And we discussed the joint effort to support regional energy security.\nAnd finally, Mr. Prime Minister, you and I affirm that the relationship between our people goes far beyond our official bounds. It is built on a strong base of strong family ties and values. It's rooted in a long, long history that underpins both our democracies.\nTo the people of Turkey, we want to express our admiration -- and I mean this in a literal sense -- our administration for the way you took to the streets and demanded you take back your democracy.\nSo I want to thank you again, Mr. Prime Minister, for your hospitality. I look forward to continuing to build on the progress we've made here when I meet with President Erdogan a little bit later this afternoon.\nAgain, thank you for your hospitality and for letting me go first. Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER YILDIRIM: (As interpreted.) Thank you. Distinguished members of the press, we have Mr. Vice President, of the United States of America, Mr. Biden. We are very happy to be welcoming him here in Ankara. So, welcome.\nI would like to thank you and your delegation for this visit. We touched upon the bloody coup attempt of the 15th of July, but we also had the opportunity of discussing regional matters. And as you mentioned, the relationship between Turkey and the United States have a very long history, a very deep-rooted history. Therefore, from time to time, there might be incidents which tend to damage this relationship. But on both sides, of course, we should never allow this to happen.\nOn the 15th of July, we had terrorists in military disguise, which had infiltrated our armed forces, and they tried to orchestrate a coup. But this attempt was defeated thanks to the determined stance of our President, and of course the actions of 79 million Turkish citizens who took ownership of their democracy, who took to the streets and defeated this assault. And on this occasion, I would like to once again honor the memory of our martyrs that sacrificed their own lives in defense of Turkish democracy, and the same goes to all of our martyrs of course that were killed in the fight against terrorist organizations. And I would like to wish a speedy recovery to the injured.\nMr. Biden, as you mentioned, this heinous coup attempt was, in our opinion, orchestrated and instructed by Fethullah Gulen. And as per the treaties that we have between our two countries, the necessary steps should be taken with a view to his extradition to our country. And we have taken the initial step in that process. And you have had very frank remarks for the Turkish people and also for our government, and those comments and remarks are of vital importance for a sound functioning of this process, and we are grateful to you for those remarks.\nSo having a technical team arriving from the U.S. here in Turkey, and talking to our judges and prosecutors here on the ground, is a clear sign from your side that you're taking this very seriously, that you're attaching great importance to this. Therefore, I would like to once again thank you for being sensitive about the matter.\nOur greatest expectation would be that we don't lose any time in conducting these legal processes, and of course the final expectation of our nation is, I believe, clear. This was an attempt against our democracy. And from the United States, which is a friend and an ally, of course, can never welcome this kind of a move. And both President Obama, yourself, and other officials from your administration, you have had many remarks in the days following the coup, and those have been of key importance for us.\nThe process of extraditing the head of the terrorist organization that was behind the attempted coup, if it can be expedited and accelerated, and if we can have more cooperation in the process, I think the grief and grievances of the Turkish people, of the Turkish nation, will be remedies to a certain degree, and their overall sentiments about the issue will go back to being more positive.\nAs you rightly mentioned, we have had good cooperation fighting against terrorism, and we had the opportunity today to go over our cooperation. We talked about actions with regard to Daesh, the PKK. And we, of course, underlined the importance of determination in fighting against these terrorist organizations.\nSo, of course, the situation in Syria is not very bright. Millions of Syrians have had to leave Syria. 500,000 Syrians lost their lives in this civil war, including the young and the elderly. And, of course, people have been displaced. And Turkey opened its doors to more than 3 million people. They are welcome here in this country. We've been sharing everything, all of our means, with them -- and we will continue to do so.\nOf course, however, this is not a sustainable situation. Therefore, both the U.S., the Russian Federation, and other players, including Turkey, Iran and other countries of the region, should come together with a very positive attitude and approach to what's been happening. And we have to put an end to what has been going on in Syria and find a solution so that we don't have any more people losing their lives.\nAnd we are particularly sensitive about two points in this. One is preserving the territorial integrity of Syria and not giving any advantages to any ethnic groups, or not allowing the circumstances that would lead to that to come together or to happen. Turkey will never accept a new Kurdish formation along its borders, and we consider this to be a grave threat to our national security. On the other hand, all ethnic groups needs to have the perception that they are being represented in a just and fair administration structure. And we will continue to work towards this end.\nWhen it comes to the Cyprus issue that has been going on for many years, also we are aware of your efforts throughout the years, which are very much appreciated by Turkey. The first time around, we missed the opportunity for a solution in Cyprus. But this time, I think, it is especially important not to miss this chance. And the Greek Cypriot administration should be very careful. It is our recommendation that they do not miss this chance for a solution.\nThe Turkish Cypriot side has been victimized as a result of embargoes and restrictions. But nonetheless, they have always been in favor of a solution on the island. And this time around, as well, they will be supportive of a solution. No one should have any doubts or hesitations about that matter. But of course, at the end of the day, even if there is an agreement, that will be subject to a referendum. That is one point to bear in mind.\nSo, Mr. Biden, the relationship between Turkey and the United States will never be disrupted by anything -- not the event or incident of the 15th of July, or anything else. We should not let that happen. And your visit today is a great opportunity to get rid of some of the misunderstandings and also to show that the U.S. administration and the American people are on the side of the Turkish government and the Turkish people, that you have great solidarity with us.\nSo with that, I would like to extend our gratitude to you, in person, and to your delegation. And it is with these thoughts that I would like to thank once again my dear friend, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Joe Biden, and your friends. Welcome to our country, sir, once again.\nNow we will have one question each. So as the host, I can take the first question. Please go ahead.\nQ Sir, this morning, an operation was initiated into Syria. Are there any details that you can share with us with regard to this operation? And will the action be targeted towards PYD in the upcoming period? And what kind of a timeframe do you have in mind for the Turkish armed forces to be present in this region?\nAnd also, a question to Vice President Mr. Biden. Sir, as the Prime Minister was saying -- the Prime Minister touched upon Turkey's position with regard to a Kurdish corridor. What's the stance that the U.S. has? How would you assess a Kurdish corridor being formed? Because the U.S. has been known to give some support to PYD and YPG over the recent period. So what is your stance when it comes to the Turkish concerns about the issue? Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER YILDIRIM: (As interpreted.) Dear friends, as you now know, there's been a structure called the Syrian Arab Coalition and they've been focusing on clearing the west of the Euphrates, the area of Manbij, from ISIS. And those operations have now come to an end. But after those operations, you had ISIS elements moving towards the Turkish border, and they started to settle in the Jarabulus area that is just across the Turkish town of Karkemish. And that was followed by PYD movement towards the Afrin region from two different directions.\nTherefore, in light of what has been happening, we have acted to protect our border security and also prevent our citizens from losing their lives, and their properties being damaged as a result of mortar and rocket fires. So starting from last night, we started firing into positions in Syria. We also have air forces -- the Turkish air forces participating in the operation. So the elements that were the closest to the border have now been pushed back.\nWe have a full agreement with the American administration when it comes to what has been going on in terms of the operations, and that is that PYD elements should never come across towards the west of the Euphrates and that they should not engage in any activities west of the river of the Euphrates.\nSo we had the opportunity of assessing these points in our meeting, as well. And we have once again seen the determination of the U.S. administration about the issues. So elements of PYD or YPG will not have any presence towards the west of the river of Euphrates. And we once again confirmed the sensitivity of the U.S. administration about the issue and we're very grateful to them for that.\nSo our general take, if you will, with regard to PYD and YPG is that we know for a fact that they are working hand in hand with PKK. It might look like that what they're doing is helping in terms of the fight against Daesh, but the U.S. should know that at the end of the day, you might maybe use a terrorist organization to defeat another one, but what you have in hand at the end of the day is that terrorist organization that you used, or that you benefitted from, and how do you deal with that terrorist organization? That is the question. Therefore, in order not to have a greater threat, I think that would be the right approach with regard to PYD and YPG.\nVICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No corridor, period. No separate entity on the Turkish border. A united Syria. And the Prime Minister explained precisely the arrangement that we have relative to both Jarabulus and the commitment we made with regard to Manbij. We have made it absolutely clear to the elements that were part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, the YPG that participated, that they must move back across the river. They cannot, will not, and under no circumstances get American support if they do not keep that commitment, period.\nAnd so I have a question now. Does anyone have a question for me?\nKaren. I'm not sure you even knew you raised your hand. You have a computer in your hand. (Laughter.)\nQ Thank you. Mr. Prime Minister, a question for you. Despite what Vice President Biden said about no U.S. participation in the coup, it's certainly been suggested by many people in your government and certainly in the media that, in fact, there was some support, if not direct participation. Are you ready to say now that your government takes what the Vice President has said as the final statement on that matter and say to the American people and to your own people that you do not believe that the United States supported or had anything to do with the coup attempt?\nAnd to Vice President Biden, in all of these statements that have come out since the initial statements in the United States about the coup attempt, certainly from President Obama and others, there's been a mention of concerns about human rights abuses -- possibly human rights abuses -- and adherence to the rule of law and principles of democracy. You didn't raise that in your statements today. Can you tell us why not? Is that because you're not concerned anymore? Is it something you decided you ought to raise in private? Thank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I'll be happy to answer the question but I'll let the Prime Minister answer his first. Or do you want me?\nThe answer is, look, the fact -- we've discussed this in our meetings today. The Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, and everyone associated that I met with so far has made it clear they plan on making sure their constitutional principles are adhered to, that the rule of law will prevail. This is a recent occurrence. Remember the confusion after 9/11. Let's give this some time. Let's give them some time.\nI believe they mean what they say, and so let's move on. The main purpose of my meeting here today was to show solidarity and, quite frankly, to -- I feel guilty that it took me this long to get here. I feel badly that there wasn't the opportunity to come a day or two or three or five after it occurred. But I am proud to be here, proud to show our solidarity with the Turkish people and the Turkish government. And I've enjoyed our, as they say in the foreign policy field -- which I hate the impression -- we had a frank and thorough conversation. Translated in the neighborhood I come from, we understand one another. We understand one another. And so let's give this some time.\nPRIME MINISTER YILDIRIM: (As interpreted.) Thank you. The frank statements of the Vice President are very important for us and for the Turkish nation. I think the Turkish people will take those into account.\nWhat I would like to say is this: The U.S. administration, President Obama, and Mr. Vice President, as well, have clearly and explicitly condemned the coup attempt not just today but before as well. And they made it clear that they see this as an act against democracy. This is the final statement in our eyes. This is what stands in our consideration. There might be different opinions among the people, of course, and those are perceptions and we are here to correct some of those perceptions. And I am sure that the healthy and sound functioning of the processes with regard to the extradition of the head of the terrorist organization will also, in a short amount of time, return or rectify the people's perception back to their normal, positive situation.\nThank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-08-24", "title": "Remarks to the Press by the Vice President and Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim in Ankara, Turkey"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122614", "text": "Today, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service, President Obama designated the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument encompassing awe-inspiring mountains, forests, and waters of north-central Maine. Building on the Administration's commitment to protecting our land, water and wildlife for future generations, this designation will permanently protect significant natural, scientific, and historic and cultural resources, wildlife habitat, and one of the most pristine watersheds in the northeast, ensuring that present and future generations are able to enjoy these lands.\nThe new national monument – which will be managed by the National Park Service – will protect approximately 87,500 acres, including the stunning East Branch of the Penobscot River and a portion of the Maine Woods that is rich in biodiversity and known for its outstanding opportunities to hike, canoe, hunt, fish, snowmobile, snowshoe and cross-country ski. In addition to protecting spectacular geology, significant biodiversity and recreational opportunities, the new monument will help support climate resiliency in the region. The protected area – together with the neighboring Baxter State Park to the west – will ensure that this large landscape remains intact, bolstering the forest's resilience against the impacts of climate change.\nFollowing years of support from many local and state elected officials, tribal leaders, businesses and members of the public across the state, this designation will build on the robust tradition of growing the park system through private philanthropy, and will reinforce the need to continue protecting our great outdoors as we enter the second century of the National Park Service. The land has been donated to the Federal Government by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby's foundation, Elliotsville Plantation, Inc., facilitated by the National Park Foundation as part of its Centennial Campaign for America's National Parks. In addition to the donation of the land, the approximately $100 million gift includes $20 million to supplement federal funds for initial park operational needs and infrastructure development at the new monument, and a pledge of another $20 million in future philanthropic support.\nStudies have shown that every dollar we invest in our national parks generates $10 for the national economy, most of which stays in the local communities, and our national parks, forests and other public lands attract visitors from all over the world, fueling local economies and supporting an estimated $646 billion national outdoor economy. Maine's biggest national park, Acadia, which began as a national monument designated in 1916 by President Wilson with lands donated to the Federal Government, was the nation's ninth most visited national park last year. In 2015, Acadia National Park attracted close to 3 million visitors, who spent an estimated $247.9 million in local communities. In addition to continuing to support traditional recreational activities such as snowmobiling and hunting, the new national monument will increase public access, help generate local and regional economic activity, and complement additional economic development efforts in the region.\nAbout the National Park Service Centennial\nTomorrow, August 25, 2016, marks the 100th anniversary of the creation of America's National Park Service. The Centennial inspires reflection on the history of America's iconic landscapes and historical and cultural sites, as well as an opportunity to look forward toward the next century of conservation and historic preservation.\nIn addition to permanently protecting more than 265 million acres of America's public lands and waters - more than any other president in history - President Obama has a strong record of protecting our nation's natural resources and taking actions that will inspire the next generation of outdoor stewards and build an inclusive vision for the next 100 years of conservation. Under President Obama, this administration has:\n•      Encouraged every kid to experience our great outdoors, including through launching an \"Every Kid in a Park\" initiative to provide all fourth-grade students and their families free admission to all public lands and waters for a full year.  More\n•      Created heritage initiatives to recognize the cultural history of all Americans through theme studies and designations. More\n•      Created thousands of jobs for young adults and veterans to help better protect, restore, and manage our country's parks and public lands and waters, including through the establishment of the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps. More\n•      Designated national monuments to reflect the diverse stories of Americans including the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument, the Pullman National Monument, the Honouliuli National Monument and most recently, the Stonewall National Monument, the nation's first National Monument honoring LGBT rights. More\n•      Increased public access to the outdoors for underserved communities with little access to public lands.  More\n•      Taken steps to better recognize and commemorate culturally significant sites, including renaming the tallest mountain in North America \"Denali\" to reflect the heritage of Alaska Natives.  More\n•      Increased recognition of the economic benefit of the outdoors, including launching an effort to begin measuring the economic impact of outdoor recreation on the American economy.  More\n•      Celebrated 99 victories for wildlife conservation, including more recoveries under the Endangered Species Act than any previous administration, often using public lands protections to restore populations.  More\n•      Dedicated unprecedented attention and resources to restoring iconic places like the Chesapeake Bay, California Bay-Delta, Great Lakes and Everglades.  More\n•      Reformed energy development on America's public lands and waters, including implementing new landscape-level planning across the country.  More\n•      Defended iconic landscapes and natural treasures, including taking action to block damaging uranium mining around the Grand Canyon and designating Alaska's Bristol Bay as off limits from future oil and gas leasing.  More\n•      Signed the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, the most extensive expansion of land and water conservation in more than a generation, which designated more than 2 million acres of Federal wilderness and protected thousands of miles of trails and more than one thousand miles of rivers.

[applause]\nBefore the vote, I said that Britain would leave the EU, sometimes referred to as European Union, and I said it and I took a lot of heat when I said it. People said, what does he know, what does he know? And guess what? I was very supportive of their right to do it and to take control of their own future, like exactly what we're going to be voting for on November 8th. [applause]\nHillary Clinton, who has been on the wrong side of history in every major decision, she's only made bad decisions, she's got bad judgment, she doesn't know what she's doing, folks. [booing]\nShe got this one wrong, too.\nShe got this one wrong, too, folks. She got this one wrong, too. She gets them all wrong. She gets them all wrong, doesn't she? She really got the e-mails wrong, that I can tell you. [laughter]\nAnd now Hillary wants to surrender America to globalism, just what we don't want. [booing]\nShe wants a country without borders. She wants trade deals written for the benefit of foreign corporations. She wants a government that ignores the will of the people. [booing]\nShe wants to sell out American security to the Clinton Foundation for a big, fat pile of cash. [booing]\nIt's hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins.\nAccording to the Associated Press, more than half the meetings she took as secretary of state with people outside government were with foundation donors. [booing]\nHillary Clinton does not believe in America first. We believe in America first. [applause]\nHillary believes in donors first and special interests and lobbyists. She will never straighten out our country. She doesn't have the strength, the stamina or the ability to straighten out our country. We'll have four more years of Obama and that's just what we don't want. [booing]\nShe would rather give a job to a refugee from overseas than an unemployed American veteran or to an unemployed African American or Hispanic. [booing]\nThe job of a public official is to serve and protect the citizens of the United States [applause]\nNot illegal immigrants, not foreign nationals seeking entry, but the people living here lawfully today, including millions of African-American and Hispanic citizens, millions, millions being treated very, very unfairly, I can tell you that.\nMy focus will always be on the well-being of more than 300 million American citizens who call this country home and who love their country. [applause]\nI will fight for their security. I will fight for their jobs. We will not let jobs be taken out of our country, be ripped out of our country and moved to Mexico and many other countries. We will not let it happen anymore. [applause]\nWe'll be fighting for their jobs and we'll be fighting for your families, that I can tell you. It ends. What's been going on ends on November 8th. [applause]\nWe will have one American nation, not divided, we will be together. Hillary Clinton has betrayed her duty to the people. November 8th is our chance to re-declare American independence. [applause]\nThis is a great honor for me. I am going right now to invite onto the stage the man behind Brexit and a man who led brilliantly the United Kingdom Independence Party in this fight and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles.\nLadies and gentlemen, Mr. Nigel Farage. [applause]\nNigel Farage: \"Well, Thank you very much\nGood evening Mississippi. [applause]\nI come to you from the United Kingdom with a message of hope and a message of optimism. It's a message that says if the little people, if the real people, if the ordinary decent people are prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in we can overcome the big banks, we can overcome the multinationals. [applause]\nAnd we did it. We made June the 23rd our independence day. [applause]\nWhen we smashed the establishment. And we did it. Everybody said we would lose but what did we see? We saw experts from all over the world. We saw the international monetary fund. We saw Moody's. We saw Standard and Poor's. We saw global leaders project fear.\nTelling us that if we voted not to be run by a bunch of unelected old men in Brussels. [applause]\nYeah, well it's okay, they don't like me either so it doesn't really matter does it? [applause]\nBut they told us our economy would fall off of a cliff. They told us there'd be mass unemployment. They told us that investment would leave our country. And David Cameron, then our Prime Minister, but no longer, told us that we might even get World War III.\nAnd we saw the comentariate and we saw the polling industry doing everything they could to demoralize our campaign. On the day of the vote itself, that morning, they put us ten points behind. And actually, they were all wrong. And they were wrong because what the Brexit campaign did is we reached those people who've been let down by modern global corporatism.\nWe reached those people. We reached those people who have never voted in their lives, but believe by going out and voting for Brexit they can take back control of their country, take back control of their borders, and get back their pride and self respect. Now, the big card, the big card the Prime Minister decided to play in the referendum was he got a foreign visitor to come to London. to talk to us.\nYes, we were visited by one Barack Obama. And he talked down to us. He treated us as if we were nothing. One of the oldest functioning democracies in the world. And here he was told us to vote remain.\nSo I, having criticized, having criticized and condemned his behavior, I could not possibly tell you how you should vote in this election, but, but, you know I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I'm hearing you, but I will say this, if I was an American citizen, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me.\nIn fact, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if she paid me.\nFolks, the message is clear. The parallels are there.\nThere are millions of ordinary Americans who have been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are politically correct parts of that liberal media elite.\nThey feel people aren't standing up for them and they've actually, in many cases, given up on the whole electoral process. And I think, I think that you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign.\nYou can go out, you can beat the pollsters, you can beat the commentators, you can beat Washington. And you'll do it by doing what we did for Brexit in Britain.\nWe had our own people's army of ordinary citizens who went out and delivered leaflets, who went to meet people where they worked and where they socialized, who convinced and inspired people to go out if this was the one and only time in their life, and to vote for change.\nSo my advice to you, if you want change in this country, you better get your walking boots on, you better get out there campaigning and remember, and remember, anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment.\nThank you very much, indeed.\"\nWow! Thank you, Nigel.\nWhat a job! What a job he did. What a job he did against all odds.\nThank you, Nigel.\nThat was some job that he did against all odds. Everybody said it couldn't be done. And by the way, it's looking like a very wise decision right now by the voters, so I really congratulate Nigel and I thank you for being here. Thank you. [applause]\nAnd if I may, we had some tremendous polls come out today. I won't bring it up, I refuse to mention it, but they were very good. We're leading in a lot of locations. [applause]\nThank you.\nIt's time for America to recapture, like you just heard, to recapture our destiny. Our government leaders and our media have totally lost touch with the people. They have, they have totally lost touch.\nYou need no better evidence of that then the fact that the media ignores the plight of Americans who have lost their children to illegal immigrants, but spends day after day pushing for amnesty for those here in total violation of the law. We can't allow that. [booing]\nWhy do our leaders spend so much time talking about how to help people here illegally, they're here illegally, and they spend and they work and they try so hard to help them, but they don't try helping American citizens, some of whom have been devastated by what's happened to their children and their families? Devastated.\njobs, wages and security for Americans. [applause]\nAnd the immigration policy I support as president must pass these three tests. First, it must improve jobs and wages for United States citizens. [applause]\nWe have people in this room who were making more money in real wages 18 years ago, were not working as hard as they're working now and they've gotten older, not supposed to be that way, and in many cases and largely because of the disaster known as \"Obamacare\" they have to hold two jobs, not one, but two jobs and, in some cases, three jobs.\nNot going to happen, folks, not going to happen.\nSecond, it must improve the safety and security for United States citizens. [applause]\nThird, it must improve the quality of life for U.S. citizens. The quality of life, our quality of life is going down.\nOur level of security, you look back years, you're more insecure now in terms of security than you were 10, 15 and 20 years ago.\nHillary Clinton's radical immigration plan fails these tests and it fails them very, very badly. Her push for open borders will lower the wages and kill the jobs of lawful American residents. [booing]\nHer support for catch-and-release will put innocent American lives at risk and already has, just like President Obama released the illegal immigrant at the border who then killed magnificent, magnificent Sarah Root.\nYesterday I met with her mom, Michelle. Hillary Clinton only talks about the separation of families who choose to come here illegally. I want to focus on the American families who have been permanently separated from their children because of the sanctuary cities and open borders that Hillary Clinton so strongly supports. [booing]\nWhere is the sanctuary for American children? Where is that sanctuary? The dreamers we never talk about are the young Americans. Why aren't young Americans dreamers also? I want my dreamers to be young Americans. [applause]\nHillary Clinton also wants to push to bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term [booing]\nA large number of whom come from large countries where women and gays are horribly brutalized, which will weaken our tolerant way of life.\nI only want to bring people to our country who share our values and love our people and are capable of loving America. [applause]\nImportantly, I will also create millions and millions of jobs for our people. [applause]\nWe are going to cut taxes, reduce regulations, fix our trade deals, unleash American energy and repeal and replace the horror show known as \"Obamacare.\" [applause]\nWe are going to create jobs, jobs, jobs! [applause]\nI will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, believe me. [applause]\nSo we're going to have millions and millions of jobs, jobs like you have never seen in this country before, because our jobs are being stolen from us, our companies are being stolen from us, our manufacturing is down by 40 percent and 50 percent and numbers that nobody even believes. Those days will be over if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, believe me. [applause]\nRising incomes, higher wages, thousands of new companies all across this nation, they'll come in and they'll form. We are going to renegotiate the worst trade deal ever made, not only in this country, but anywhere in the world, known as NAFTA and signed by Bill Clinton. [booing]\nWe're going to stand up to China on trade. We're going to keep out of what will be a disastrous trade deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP. [booing]\nIt will not happen with me. It will absolutely happen with crooked Hillary, believe me.\nThis state has lost more than 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and it's lost one in four manufacturing jobs since he put China into the World Trade Organization, both deals supported by Hillary Clinton. Horrible deals, destructive deals, what those deals have done to our jobs and to our country.\nWe are going to bring back jobs to Mississippi [applause]\nAnd in North Carolina, which has treated me so well, and Ohio and to Michigan where our auto plants are leaving and leaving and leaving and going to Mexico and other places, and to Pennsylvania, where I went to school, and to Maryland and all across this land. We're going to bring our jobs back and we're not going to let our jobs be taken away. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you.\nAnd I'm going to make it my personal mission to bring opportunity, safety and prosperity to our very, very troubled inner cities. [applause]\nThe Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. [booing]\nDemocratic crime policies, education policies and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes and more poverty than we've ever had in those communities before. [booing]\nNearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working. More than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of this year alone. [booing]\nViolent crime has risen 17 percent, and in America's 50 largest cities it's only going one way, folks, and that's up. Homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington, D.C. and more than 60 percent from last year in Baltimore.\nThe Democratic Party has taken the votes of African Americans totally for granted, and they've done nothing in return. [booing]\nThey've just assumed they'll get your support and they've done nothing, absolutely nothing to deserve it.\nIt's time to give the Democrats some competition for African- American votes and for Hispanic votes. [applause]\nIt's time to rebuild the inner cities of America and do it properly. It's time to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system. And I was the first to use that term, it's a rigged, disgusting system. [applause]\nTo those hurting and suffering and left behind, I say, what do you have to lose by trying something new? What do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump for president? What do you have to lose? I will fix the problem. I will fix the problem. [applause]\nIf you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same horrible results.\nBut I also want to talk about what you have to gain, right? Right? What do you have to gain? We will create school choice and allow charter schools to absolutely thrive. [applause]\nWhat else will we gain? We will empower young Americans to pursue their dreams of opening a small business and make it easier for them to get the credit that they need. [applause]\nWe will renegotiate our horrible trade deals to bring back jobs and opportunity. And the African-American community and the Hispanic community will be our biggest beneficiary of that. [applause]\nWe will lower taxes and unleash job creation and we will tap into trillions of dollars in new energy wealth that we never even knew we had before. [applause]\nWe will protect your jobs from illegal immigration and broken visa programs. And we will rebuild the roads, the bridges, the infrastructure, the tunnels, the airports in your communities and we will rebuild it with our companies, with our steel and with our labor. [applause]\nHillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color [applause]\nonly as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future. She's going to do nothing for African Americans. She's going to do nothing for the Hispanics. She's only going to take care of herself, her husband, her consultants, her donors. These are the people she cares about. She doesn't care what her policies have done to your communities. She doesn't care.\nRemember this. You've had her policies, Democrats running some of the inner cities for 50, 70, 80, even over a hundred years. And look what you have right now, poverty, no education, crime, you can't walk down the street with your child. We're going to fix it, we're going to fix it. [applause]\nHillary Clinton has no remorse. I will fight to create a better future for every American. The hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors are throwing money at Hillary Clinton to try and stop our change agenda.\nOf course, if they start looking at the polls they may stop doing that. [applause]\nThey're going to have to start studying those polls. That's why you need to come out and you have to vote, you have to vote. [applause]\nThat is why you must make your voice heard on November 8th, have to do it. [applause]\nAnother crucial issue in this race is national security. Hillary Clinton may go down as the worst secretary of state that has ever served in that office. [booing]\nLet's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama/Clinton administration, that I call a catastrophe, took over. Libya was stable. Syria was under control. Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished, would never have happened. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.\nFast forward to today. After spending $4 trillion, maybe $5 trillion, nobody even knows how much money has been sucked out of our country, what have the decisions of Obama/Clinton produced?\nLibya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead. And ISIS has gained a new base of operations, they're all over the world\nSyria is in the midst of a totally disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of the territory.\nA refugee crisis now threatens Europe and is threatening the United States because Hillary is allowing these people to pour into our country and we don't know who they are, where they come from. We know nothing.\nIraq is in chaos and ISIS is on the loose.\nISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the west. At the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and definitely folks, definitely, I have been very good at predicting, definitely to the United States. [booing]\nIran has become the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with up to $150 billion in cash released by the United States, plus another $400 million in cash, cash, cash ransom [booing]\nThat President Obama said had nothing to do with ransom, had nothing to do with the hostages, and his own people said he was wrong. [booing]\nHe lied. He lied. Just like he said Obamacare, \"keep your plan, you'll keep your doctor,\" 28 times, \"keep your plan, keep your doctor.\" And because of that lie, Democrats that would have never passed it passed it and now they regret that they passed it because it is a total disaster. [booing]\nWorst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number-one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East and put the nation of Iran, which chants, constantly chants \"death to America\" in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power. And we put them there over the last three years! [booing]\nThis is the legacy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness. [booing]\nBut Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. We're going to end the era of nation-building, a disastrous concept, a disastrous era, and create new foreign policy joined by our partners in the Middle East that is focused completely on destroying ISIS. We have no choice destroying ISIS. [applause]\nWe will extend a hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.\nI have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our people, our citizens, trying to hurt the world, but trying to hurt the United States: We will find you, we will destroy you and we will win! [applause]\nThank you. Thank you.\nThis is not only a military fight, but it will also require cyber warfare and financial warfare. It's also an ideological fight. We will confront directly the hateful, it's just so hateful, ideology of radical Islam and promote American values and American culture and America's system of government.\nOnly by standing up for and supporting, we have to stand up for and support, our values can we become a united country once again [applause]\nA country of great jobs and wealth, a country of security and freedom, a country of strength and unity. The future is limitless. All we have to do is believe in America once again. We have to believe it can happen. It can happen. [applause]\nWe will put back our faith in America's special destiny. We will lift the burdens on small business which is being driven into extinction by what's happening in our government. We'll create a level playing field for American workers. We'll never ever let what's happened to them happen to them again. We'll establish justice and opportunity and safety in every community in the land.\nI am asking for the vote of every citizen in this country, African American, Hispanic, all Americans, all Americans who want a better, brighter and stronger future for yourselves and for our country. [applause]\nI am the change candidate. This is our moment to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. [applause]\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. I will be your champion and I will work hard to be your champion.\nAnd I won't be playing golf instead of going to see the people in Louisiana who have been devastated by floods. [applause]\nI'm going to be the champion to every parent who dreams for their children. And to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am with you, I will fight for you, and we will win for you, we will win. [applause]\nTogether we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, we will make America great again.\nThank you and God bless you. Thank you, Mississippi. We love Mississippi. God bless you. Thank you. [applause]", "timestamp": "2016-08-24", "title": "Remarks at the Mississippi Coliseum in Jackson, Mississippi"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118836", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nIn north central Maine lies an area of the North Woods known in recent years as the Katahdin Woods and Waters Recreation Area (Katahdin Woods and Waters), approximately 87,500 acres within a larger landscape already conserved by public and private efforts starting a century ago. Katahdin Woods and Waters contains a significant piece of this extraordinary natural and cultural landscape: the mountains, woods, and waters east of Baxter State Park (home of Mount Katahdin, the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail), where the East Branch of the Penobscot River and its tributaries, including the Wassataquoik Stream and the Seboeis River, run freely. Since the glaciers retreated 12,000 years ago, these waterways and associated resources—the scenery, geology, flora and fauna, night skies, and more—have attracted people to this area. Native Americans still cherish these resources. Lumberjacks, river drivers, and timber owners have earned their livings here. Artists, authors, scientists, conservationists, recreationists, and others have drawn knowledge and inspiration from this landscape.\nKatahdin Woods and Waters contains objects of significant scientific and historic interest. For some 11,000 years, Native peoples have inhabited the area, depending on its waterways and woods for sustenance. They traveled during the year from the upper reaches of the East Branch of the Penobscot River and its tributaries to coastal destinations like Frenchman and Penobscot Bays. Native peoples have traditionally used the rivers as a vast transportation network, seasonally searching for food, furs, medicines, and many other resources. Based on the results of archeological research performed in nearby areas, researchers believe that much of the archeological record of this long Native American presence in Katahdin Woods and Waters remains to be discovered, creating significant opportunity for scientific investigation. What is known is that the Wabanaki people, in particular the Penobscot Indian Nation, consider the Penobscot River (including the East Branch watershed) a centerpiece of their culture and spiritual values.\nThe first documented Euro-American exploration of the Katahdin region dates to a 1793 survey commissioned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. After Maine achieved statehood in 1820, Major Joseph Treat, guided by John Neptune of the Penobscot Tribe, produced the first detailed maps of the region. The Maine Boundary Commission authorized a survey of the new State in 1825, for which surveyor Joseph C. Norris, Sr., and his son established the \"Monument Line,\" which runs through Katahdin Woods and Waters and serves as the State's east-west baseline from which township boundaries are drawn.\nBy the early 19th century until the late 20th century, logging was a way of life throughout the area, as exemplified by the history of logging along the Wassataquoik Stream. To access the upstream forests, a tote road was built on the Wassataquoik's north bank around 1841; traces of the old road can still be seen in places. The earliest loggers felled enormous white pines and then \"drove\" them down the tumultuous stream. Beginning in the 1880s, after the choice pines were gone, the loggers switched to spruce long logs, and built camps, depots, and many dams on the Wassataquoik to control its flow for the log drives. Remnants of the Dacey and Robar Dams have been found, and discovery of more logging remnants and historic artifacts is likely. Log driving was dangerous, and many men died on the river and were buried nearby. A large fire in 1884 damaged logging operations on the Wassataquoik, and an even larger fire in 1903 put an end to the long log operations. Pulpwood operations resumed in 1910 but ceased in 1915. Other streams, like Sandy Stream, have similar logging histories.\nThe East Branch of the Penobscot River and its major tributaries served as a thoroughfare for huge log drives headed toward Bangor. Log drives ended (based primarily on environmental concerns) in the 1970s, after which the timber companies relied on trucking and a network of private roads they started to build in the 1950s.\nIn the 1800s, the infrastructure that developed to support the logging industry also drew hunters, anglers, and hikers to the area. In the 1830s, within 2 miles of one another on the eastern side of the Penobscot East Branch, William Hunt and Hiram Dacey established farms to serve loggers, which soon also served recreationists, scientists, and others who wanted to explore the Katahdin region or climb its mountains. Just across the East Branch from the Hunt and Dacey Farms (the latter now the site of Lunksoos Camps) lies the entrance to the Wassataquoik Stream. In 1848, the Reverend Marcus Keep established what is still called Keep Path, running along the Wassataquoik to Katahdin Lake and on to Mount Katahdin. From that time until the end of the 19th century, the favored entryway to the Katahdin region started on the east side of Mount Katahdin with a visit to Hunt or Dacey Farm, then crossed the East Branch and ascended the valley of the Wassataquoik Stream.\nHenry David Thoreau—who made the \"Maine Woods\" famous through his publications—approached from the headwaters of the East Branch to the north. With his Penobscot guide Joe Polis and companion Edward Hoar in 1857, on his last and longest trip to the area, he paddled past Dacey Farm with just a brief stop at Hunt Farm. He wrote about his two nights in the Katahdin Woods and Waters area—the first at what he named the \"Checkerberry-tea camp,\" near the oxbow just upriver from Stair Falls, and the second on the river between Dacey and Hunt Farms where he drank hemlock tea.\nDuring his 1879 Maine trip on which he summited Mount Katahdin, Theodore Roosevelt followed the route across the East Branch and up the Wassataquoik. As Roosevelt later recalled, he lost one of his hiking boots crossing the Wassataquoik but, undaunted, completed the challenging trek in moccasins. Many including Roosevelt himself have observed that his several trips to the Katahdin region in the late 1870s had a significant impact on his life, as he overcame longstanding health problems, gained strength and stamina, experienced the wonder of nature and the desire to conserve it, and made friends for life from the Maine Woods.\nNative Mainer Percival P. Baxter, too, followed this route on the 1920 trip that solidified his determination to create a large park from this landscape. Burton Howe, a Patten lumberman, organized this trip of Maine notables, who stayed at Lunksoos Camps before their ascent via the established route. As a State representative, senator, and governor, Baxter had proposed legislation to create a Mount Katahdin park in commemoration of the State's centennial, and the 1920 trip cemented his profound appreciation of the landscape. Spurned by the Maine legislature, Baxter devoted his life to acquiring 28 parcels of land, largely from timber companies who had heavily logged them, and donated them to the State with management instructions and an endowment, resulting in the establishment of Baxter State Park. Artists and photographers have left indelible images of their time spent in the area. In 1832, John James Audubon canoed the East Branch and sketched natural features for his masterpiece Birds of America. Frederic Edwin Church, the preeminent landscape artist of the Hudson River School, first visited the area in the 1850s, and in 1877 invited his landscape-painter colleagues to join him on a well-publicized expedition from Hunt Farm up the Wassataquoik Stream to capture varied views of Mount Katahdin and environs. In the early 1900s, George H. Hallowell painted and photographed the log drives on the Wassataquoik Stream, and Carl Sprinchorn painted logging activities on the Seboeis River.\nGeologists were among the earliest scientists to visit the area. While surveys were done in the 1800s, in-depth geological research and mapping of the area did not begin until the 1950s. These mid-20th century geologists found bedrock spanning over 150 million years of the Paleozoic era, revealing a remarkably complete exposure of Paleozoic rock strata with well-preserved fossils. The lands west of the Penobscot East Branch are dominated by volcanic and granitic rock from the Devonian period, mostly Katahdin Granite but also Traveler Rhyolite, a light-colored volcanic rock that is similar in composition to granite. The oldest rock in Katahdin Woods and Waters, a light greenish-gray quartzite interlayered with slate from the early Cambrian period (over 500 million years ago), can be observed along the riverbank of the Penobscot East Branch for over 1,000 feet at the Grand Pitch (a river rapid). This rock is part of the Weeksboro-Lunksoos Lake anticline, a broad upward fold of rocks originally deposited horizontally, which is evidence of mountain-building tectonics. The fold continues north along the river and then turns northeast toward Shin Pond, exposing successive bands of younger Paleozoic rock of both volcanic and sedimentary origin on either side of the structure.\nVarious formations in the area provide striking visual evidence of marine waters in Katahdin Woods and Waters during the geologic periods that immediately followed the Cambrian period. For example, Owen Brook limestone, an outcrop of calcareous bedrock west of the Penobscot East Branch containing fossil brachiopods, is of coral reef origin. Pillow lavas, such as those near the summit of Lunksoos Mountain, were produced by underwater eruptions. Haskell Rock, the 20-foot-tall pillar in the midst of a Penobscot East Branch rapid, is conglomerate bedrock that suggests a time of dynamic transition from volcanic islands to an ocean with underwater sedimentation. This conglomerate, deposited about 450 million years ago, contains volcanic and sedimentary stones of various sizes, and occurs in outcrops and boulders in several locations.\nThe area's geology also provides prominent evidence of large and powerful earth-changing events. During the Paleozoic era (541 to 252 million years ago), mountain-building events contributed to the rise of the primordial Appalachian Mountain range and the amalgamation of the supercontinent Pangaea. Following the last mountain-building event, significant erosion reshaped the topography, helping to expose the cores of volcanoes, the Katahdin pluton, and the structure of the previous mountain-building events. About 200 million years ago, Pangaea began splitting apart as the Atlantic Ocean appeared and North America, Europe, and Africa formed. Today, the International Appalachian Trail, a long-distance hiking trail, seeks to follow the ancestral Appalachian-Caledonian Mountains on both sides of the Atlantic, starting at Katahdin Lake in Baxter State Park near the northern end of the domestic Appalachian Trail, traversing Katahdin Woods and Waters for about 30 miles, and proceeding through Canada for resumption across the Atlantic.\nIn more recent geological history, during the approximately 2.5 million year-long Pleistocene epoch that ended approximately 12,000 years ago, repeated glaciations covered the region, eroding bedrock and shaping the modern landscape. Glacial till from the most recent glaciations underlies much of the area's soil, moraines occur in several locations, and glacial erratics are common. Prominent eskers—long, snaking ridges of sand and gravel deposited by glacial meltwater—occur along most of the Penobscot East Branch and the Wassataquoik Stream. Glacial landforms, glacial scoured bedrock, and the lake sediments in the area, deposited only since the retreat of the last glaciers, record a history of intense climate change that gave rise to the modern topography of the area.\nThis post-glacial topography is studded with attractive small mountains, including some like Deasey, Lunksoos, and Barnard, that offer spectacular views of Mount Katahdin. Katahdin Woods and Waters abuts much of Baxter State Park's eastern boundary, extending the conservation landscape through shared mountains, streams, corridors for plants and animals, and other natural systems.\nAmong the defining natural features of Katahdin Woods and Waters is the East Branch of the Penobscot River system, including its major tributaries, the Seboeis River and the Wassataquoik Stream, and many smaller tributaries. Known as one of the least developed watersheds in the northeastern United States, the Penobscot East Branch River system has a stunning concentration of hydrological features in addition to its significant geology and ecology. From the northern boundary of Katahdin Woods and Waters, the main stem of the East Branch drops over 200 feet in about 10 miles through a series of rapids and waterfalls—including Stair Falls, Haskell Rock Pitch, Pond Pitch, Grand Pitch, the Hulling Machine, and Bowlin Falls.\nAfter Bowlin Brook, the main stem declines more gently south toward Whetstone Falls and below, embroidered with many side channels and associated floodplain forests and open streamshores. Of the two major tributaries, the Seboeis River flows in from the east, and the Wassataquoik Stream from the west, the latter dropping over 500 feet in its approximately 14-mile wild run from the border of Baxter State Park to its confluence with the Penobscot East Branch main stem.\nThe extraordinary significance of the Penobscot East Branch River system has long been recognized. A 1977 Department of the Interior study determined that the East Branch of the Penobscot River, including the Wassataquoik Stream, qualifies for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System based on its outstandingly remarkable values, and a 1982 Federal-State study of rivers in Maine determined that the Penobscot East Branch River System, including both the Wassataquoik Stream and the Seboeis River, ranks in the highest category of natural and recreational rivers and possesses nationally significant resource values.\nIn recent years, a multi-party public-private project has taken steps to reconnect the Penobscot River with the sea through the removal and retrofitting of downstream dams. This river restoration will likely further enhance the integrity of the Penobscot East Branch river system, and provide opportunities for scientific study of the effects of the restoration on upstream areas within Katahdin Woods and Waters. It will also allow federally endangered Atlantic salmon to return to the upper reaches of the river known in the Penobscot language as \"Wassetegweweck,\" or \"the place where they spear fish.\" The return of ocean-run Atlantic salmon to this watershed would complement the exceptional native brook trout fishery for which Katahdin Woods and Waters is known today.\nKatahdin Woods and Waters possesses significant biodiversity. Spanning three ecoregions, it displays the transition between northern boreal and southern broadleaf deciduous forests, providing a unique and important opportunity for scientific investigation of the effects of climate change across ecotones. The forests include mixed hardwoods like sugar maple, beech, and yellow birch; mixed forests with hardwoods, hemlock, and white pine; and spruce-fir forests with balsam fir, red spruce, and birches. In wetland areas, black spruce, white spruce, red maple, and tamarack dominate.\nAlthough significant portions of the area have been logged in recent years, the regenerating forests retain connectivity and provide significant biodiversity among plant and animal communities, enhancing their ecological resilience. With the complex matrix of microclimates represented, the area likely contains the attributes needed to sustain natural ecological function in the face of climate change, and provide natural strongholds for species into the future. These forests also afford connections and scientific comparisons with the forests on adjacent State land, including Baxter State Park, which was logged heavily before its parcel-by-parcel purchase by former Governor Percival Baxter between 1931 and 1963.\nOf particular scientific significance are the number and quality of small and medium-sized patch ecosystems throughout the area, tending to occur in less common topography that is often relatively remote or inaccessible. Hilltops and barrens often protect rare flora and fauna, such as the blueberry-lichen barren and associated spruce-heath barren found between Robar and Eastern Brooks, and the three-toothed cinquefoil-blueberry low summit bald atop Lunksoos Mountain, where rattlesnake hawkweed can be found. Cliffs and steep slopes, like those present along the ridge from Deasey Mountain to Little Spring Brook Mountain and on the eastern sides of Billfish and Traveler Mountains, harbor exemplary rock outcrop ecosystems that often include flora of special interest, such as fragrant cliff wood-fern and purple clematis. Ravines and coves can support enriched forests like the maple-basswood-ash community found below the eastern cliffs of Lunksoos Mountain, with trees over 250 years old and associated rare plants including squirrel-corn. The Appalachian-Acadian rivershore ecosystems of the Penobscot East Branch and its two major tributaries are considered exemplary in Maine, with occurrences of beautiful silver maple floodplain forest and hardwood river terrace forest—rare and imperiled natural communities, respectively, in the State. A nationally significant diversity of high quality wetlands and wet basins occurs throughout Katahdin Woods and Waters, including smaller streams and brooks, ponds, swamps, bogs, and fens. Patch forests of various types also occur throughout the area, such as a red-pine woodland forest on small hills and ridges amid the large Mud Brook Flowage wetland in the southwestern section.\nThe expanse of Katahdin Woods and Waters, augmented by its location next to other large conservation properties including Baxter State Park and additional State reservations, supports many wide-ranging wildlife species including ruffed grouse, moose, black bear, white-tailed deer, snowshoe hare, American marten, bobcat, bald eagle, northern goshawk, and the federally threatened Canada lynx. Seventy-eight bird species are known to breed in the area, and many more bird species use it. Visitation and study of the area have been limited to date, as compared with other areas like Baxter State Park, and many more species of birds and other wildlife may be present.\nCertain wildlife species are known to occur in specific patch ecosystems in the area, such as the short-eared owl in hilltops and barrens, and the silver-haired bat and the wood turtle in floodplain forests. Mussels such as the tidewater mucket and yellow lampmussel live in some of the brooks and streams, and rare invertebrates like the copper butterfly, pygmy snaketail dragonfly, Tomah mayfly, and Roaring Brook mayfly inhabit some of its bogs and fens.\nKatahdin Woods and Waters's daytime scenery is awe-inspiring, from the breadth of its mountain-studded landscape, to the channels of its free-flowing streams with their rapids, falls, and quiet water, to its vantages for viewing the Mount Katahdin massif, the \"greatest mountain.\" The area's night skies rival this experience, glittering with stars and planets and occasional displays of the aurora borealis, in this area of the country known for its dark sky.\nWhereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;\nWhereas, for the purpose of establishing a national monument to be administered by the National Park Service, Elliotsville Plantation, Inc. (EPI), has donated certain lands and interests in land within Katahdin Woods and Waters to the Federal Government;\nWhereas, the Roxanne Quimby Foundation has established a substantial endowment with the National Park Foundation to support the administration of a national monument;\nWhereas, Katahdin Woods and Waters is an exceptional example of the rich and storied Maine Woods, enhanced by its location in a larger protected landscape, and thus would be a valuable addition to the Nation's natural, historical, and cultural heritage conserved and enjoyed in the National Park System;\nWhereas, it is in the public interest to preserve and protect the historic and scientific objects in Katahdin Woods and Waters;\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as a part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map entitled, \"Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument,\" which is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118908", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see a correction marked by an asterisk below.\n11:39 A.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good morning, everybody.\nQ: It is morning.\nMR. EARNEST: It is morning. Nice to see you all.\nQ: Love it.\nMR. EARNEST: I do not have any comments to make at the top, so we can go straight to your questions. Kathleen, would you like to start?\nQ: Sure. I wanted to see if you had an update on the situation in Italy at all, if you have any new announcements on assistance or resources.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any additional details about the situation in Italy. Obviously, we've seen Italian officials significantly increase the number of people that they have now concluded died in an earthquake, and I think it's an indication of how traumatic an event this was. And I know that Secretary Kerry has had an opportunity to consult with his counterpart, and the U.S. offer of assistance remains open.\nEven in an event like this where the devastation is so widespread, the Italian capabilities are significant, and they have significant resources in this region of their country that is prone to earthquakes. But we're obviously going to stay in close touch with Italian officials, and if there are ways for the U.S. government or individuals in the United States to offer them assistance in dealing with the aftermath of this tragic event, we'll be prepared to offer that assistance.\nBut at this point, I'm not aware of any specific assistance that's been requested so far.\nQ: Okay. And then, moving on to Yemen, U.N. Human Rights Chief is calling for an international investigation into rights abuses and treatment of civilians in that conflict. And I'm wondering whether or not the White House is concerned about some of the rise in civilian casualties in that war, and if there is any pressure being put on the Saudi government to mitigate that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have been concerned for quite some time about the degree to which civilians in Yemen have been caught in a crossfire in that conflict, and that's been a source of significant concern. And we have encouraged all sides in that conflict to be mindful of the responsibilities that they have to avoid civilian casualties.\nSo that's a message that we have delivered. It's also why the United States has been so strongly supportive of U.N. and other multilateral efforts to try to bring the military conflict in that country to an end. But Yemen is a country that's been plagued by significant problems for quite some time, and our partners in Saudi Arabia have been understandably concerned about the way that the turmoil and conflict in that country poses a security threat along their border.\nSo their concerns about that situation are understandable, but there have been widespread reports about civilians being caught in the crossfire. And we've encouraged all sides in that conflict to be mindful of the responsibility that they have to prevent and avoid civilian casualties.\nQ: So you don't see this as a moment to specifically call out any of the Saudi attacks or to apply additional pressure to --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there have been -- I mean, unfortunately there have been reports for years about -- or at least more than a year of situations in that conflict where civilians have been innocently harmed or killed. And we've expressed concerns about that many times in the past. We continue to have those concerns and continue to publicly remind people on all sides of that conflict that they have a responsibility to avoid civilian casualties.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thank you. So, Florida Governor Rick Scott on Wednesday, he was complaining that the federal government has not delivered all the Zika antibody tests and laboratory support that he has requested. I was wondering, do you have any response to that? Why hasn't Florida gotten all of the antibody tests it's asked for?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to the specific requests that the Governor has made. I'd refer you to my colleagues at the CDC who may be able to provide you an update on the provision of that assistance.\nI think what is clear is that the federal response has been negatively affected by the refusal of Republicans in Congress to act on the funding request that President Obama put forward six months ago. It is clear that there is more that the federal government can and should be doing to try to protect the American people. And there's no reason this should devolve into a partisan fight.\nThe President put forward a funding request based on the advice that he received from his national security team, from public health professionals and from the top scientists in the federal government. And despite that scientific request, Republicans have engineered a political strategy to block it. And that's been quite disappointing, particularly when you consider that it's congressional representatives in Congress, in the Republican Party, who are representing states that are most directly affected or at the highest risk from the Zika virus. There are a lot of Florida Republicans in the House of Representatives who opposed the President's funding request.\nSo I certainly understand Governor Scott's frustration. But at the end of the day, the President, the Vice President, the top scientists in the U.S. government have appealed to Congress, appealed to Republicans in Congress, encouraging them to act on this funding request. And Republicans in Congress have resisted.\nAt some point, leading Republicans from the states that are most directly affected are going to need to echo this call. And we're going to need to see Republican senators from Florida and from Louisiana and from Georgia contact Mitch McConnell. We're going to need to see Republican House members from Texas and Alabama and Mississippi appeal to Speaker Ryan and make the same case that President Obama and leading scientists have made about the necessity of Congress acting on Zika funding.\nQ: Well, Republicans will say they have passed a funding bill, but I know that the White House did not support some of the provisions that were in it.\nMR. EARNEST: It didn't pass the Senate.\nQ: And they would say that Democrats didn't go along with that. But I guess -- so my question is, does the bill have to be --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not really sure why that's an excuse. They've got a strong majority. The President put forward a strong proposal that also got bipartisan support in the Congress. There are some Republicans that did support the administration's funding request.\nUltimately, there is a responsibility that Leader McConnell has as the leader of the Senate to do important things for the American people. That's why he ran for the job in the first place. He wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal the day after the election saying, under his leadership, \"now we can get Congress moving again.\" Apparently, he didn't explicitly note that he was not going to get Congress moving again when it actually relates to public health emergencies and properly funding the response.\nBut he's failed on that. And Republicans have failed. And Republicans are the ones that have to account for their failure to get this done.\nQ: I guess on to Syria, Russia has agreed to a 48-hour humanitarian ceasefire in Aleppo, but there's -- some security guarantees are being awaited from other parties on the ground. I wonder, did you have any kind of response to that agreement? Support for that -- this temporary ceasefire? Anything like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's important to understand the context here. And the fact of the matter is that over the last month, the Assad regime, backed by the Iranians and the Russians, launched an offensive in Aleppo to try to cut that city off, to try to isolate that city to enhance pressure on not just the civilians who live there, but also the opposition forces that are based there, as well.\nAnd in encircling the city, the Assad regime blocked the very road that the U.N. was using to provide humanitarian access. And again, the efforts of the regime were backed by the Russians and the Iranians. So that's why you're not going to see me standing here giving the Russians all that much credit for their position on this.\nWhat the United States supports is the U.N. effort to try to broker all sides to come together around some kind of agreement that would allow humanitarian assistance to reach people in the city who so badly need it. And we certainly would welcome the Russians and others engaging constructively in that process and reaching an agreement so that that badly needed humanitarian access can be provided.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Donald Trump's recent comments to try to win over African Americans, and talking to them about how the Democratic Party has been for them have obviously been controversial. Donna Brazile called his comments \"delusional,\" I think. So what does the administration think about his pitch to black people in America?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think I have a specific response to the appeal that's being made by the Republican nominee. What I will say is something that the President has said, which is the President does believe that these are the kinds of debates that we should have in the context of a presidential election, that candidates in both parties should put forward their agenda, and the priorities and promises that are made by the candidates should be carefully scrutinized by the news media and by the voters. And so people who are interested in understanding the priorities and agenda of the candidates should look at their record, should listen to their rhetoric on the campaign trail, and should draw their own conclusions about whether or not that person is likely to represent their views in a leadership position in Washington, D.C.\nAnd obviously, the President has strongly held views about the ideas that have been put forward by both sides. But ultimately people are going to decide for themselves, and they should do so based on a careful examination of the record and agenda of both candidates.\nQ: Some people are talking about feeling offended by some of the things he said as it relates to African Americans. So the President, not only being African American, but feeling strongly about this issue -- is he offended by those comments?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't asked him about this particular aspect of the Republican nominee's pitch. But, look, I think the President does believe that the candidates should be judged based on their record, based on their history, but also based on the agenda and priorities that they're laying out and based on the promises that they are making in the context of the campaign. And it's important for all of you to scrutinize that, and clearly you're asking about it so that's something that you've done, but it's important for voters to do the same thing.\nQ: Okay. And let's talk about some of the things that Vice President Biden said yesterday. It came up briefly. But not only did he say, \"God willing\" there will be enough evidence that you're presenting against him, but he said that he wished that Gьlen was in another country. So is he kind of just -- was this a slip of the tongue in some of the comments that he made? Does the administration agree with both of these statements, or not agree with them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the point that Vice President Biden was making is that there is a well-established process that is outlined in the extradition treaty between the United States and Turkey and the U.S. law that governs how these kinds of requests are resolved. And I think, again, what I think he's alluding to is the fact that this issue has created some tension in the relationship between the United States and Turkey, and it's not tension that is going to be quickly resolved, because it's important for this process to be followed and for the rule to be followed, and for the treaty to be adhered to.\nAnd the administration has made a firm commitment to the Turkish government that we will consider their requests on the merits, and we've actually followed up those promises with action. There are Department of Justice officials in Turkey right now meeting with their counterparts to go over the evidence that's been presented. And I think that's an indication that we're committed to following the process. And again, I think what the Vice President is alluding to is the fact that this issue that's created obvious tension in the relationship between our two countries is not something that's going to be resolved overnight. It's not a decision that can be made unilaterally on short notice by the executive branch. There is a much longer process that has to be followed, and the administration is committed to following it even as we are aware of the concerns that have been raised by our allies in Turkey.\nQ: But do you think that he misspoke when he said, God willing, there will be enough evidence?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I wasn't in Turkey when the Vice President made those remarks, and I haven't had an opportunity to talk to him or his team, since they're flying back from Europe now. But I think the intent of his message I think is consistent with what we've been saying from the beginning.\nQ: And also, I think he had mentioned Gitmo also. We talked about this yesterday, too.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: When you're saying that the President feels that this he'll get this closed by the time he leaves office, but there are also people that have not been cleared for transfer to other countries and you won't transfer those people, so then is the process and the plan that those people eventually will be cleared for transfer? Because I thought there were always going to be a handful that you couldn't transfer and you knew that already. So how is he going to get this closed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, what we will continue to do is to work to overcome the obstacles that Congress has erected to prevent the closure of the prison at Guantanamo Bay. And that's unfortunate, particularly when you consider that Democrats and Republicans, national security professionals in both parties, agree with the conclusion that President Obama has reached, which is that the American people are best served by closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, both as a matter of national security -- because closing the prison would remove a tool that we know extremists use to recruit followers -- it also would save taxpayers money, and it's a fiscally responsible proposal and approach that we are taking here.\nAnd it's not just the Obama administration that's making that case. Democrats and Republicans who are experts have made this case. So we're going to do our best to try to get this closed, and it's our expectation that that's what we'll do. I can't lay out for you exactly the path for how that's going to take place right now, but the President has made clear that this is a priority and he did that in the earliest days of his presidency, and it remains a priority here at the last several months of his presidency.\nQ: Just to be clear -- so you're saying that Congress will have to be involved then to completely close it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I'm saying is that Congress has erected enormous barriers that we have to figure out a way to deal with them. And we would welcome constructive engagement from Congress to accomplish this goal that, again, Democratic and Republican foreign policy experts have acknowledged is the right goal -- and that's closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nBill.\nQ: Apart from the funding, Governor Scott has also called on the administration, he says, repeatedly, to outline ways in which Florida should be able to cooperate with FEMA to combat the Zika virus. He says that hasn't been forthcoming. Is there a reason that the administration can't do that? Is that connected to the funding?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the specifics of his request. I know that public health professionals at the CDC have been engaged with their counterparts at the Florida Department of Health even before Zika was detected in Florida -- or at least even before local transmission was detected in Florida.\nSo we've been focused on robust, effective state and local and federal coordination on this. So if there are any differences of opinion about this, I'd refer you to CDC for how we can work through them.\nQ: But he seems to suggest that there have been repeated requests that haven't been answered.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not sure exactly what they are, but you might check with the CD. And if there's a holdup, they can explain to you what it might be. And it's certainly possible that some of that holdup is related to the insufficient funding that Republicans in Congress have provided for this effort.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you give me the administration's reaction to the U.N.'s report that the Assad regime is, in fact, using chemical weapons on the people of that country?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, what we have seen from the Assad regime for years now is the unconscionable use of violence directed at innocent civilians. Indiscriminate violence has basically left the country in tatters. And it's the failure of the Assad regime's political leadership that we have reached this point where they have directed the might of the Syrian military against innocent people and against political opponents of President Assad's leadership.\nAnd that indiscriminate use of violence has taken a variety of forms. It's included the use of barrel bombs. It's included the targeting of medical facilities and other areas that everybody knows civilians are located. And it has also included the weaponization of an industrial compound like chlorine in a way that has created innocent victims.\nSo there's nothing particularly surprising here. But it is something that has rightly earned international condemnation, and is an indication of the continuing tactics that have been employed by the Assad regime that have cost him the legitimacy to keep leading that country.\nQ: Can I ask you about the EpiPen controversy? We looked at some of the pricing. As far back as 2007, they were going for about $57 each. I've read in reporting that the prices have gone up about 500 percent just since 2009. And while the company today did make an acknowledgement that they would do something to help people by making an adjustment in their pricing, what's the administration's reaction to this problem, which I think will impact millions of Americans, to say nothing of the fact that people who can't afford $600 for an EpiPen? In particular, we're talking about a kid who might have asthma or other life-endangering problems.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. Listen, this has gotten a lot of attention over the last couple of weeks. And we had an opportunity to talk about this yesterday. I'm just not going to be in a position to talk about the individual pricing strategies of a private company, in part because that private company is regulated by the federal government in a variety of ways. So I'll let the regulators do their job.\nBut I'll make the same observation I did yesterday, which is that there are other pharmaceutical companies that have tried to style themselves as innovators and people who are committed to advancing public health through the discovery of lifesaving medicine. Other pharmaceutical companies have run into problems when they have sought to, in a morally questionable way -- morally questionable, at best -- jack up the prices on lifesaving medicine. Jacking up the price on lifesaving medicine is inconsistent with a stated mission of providing lifesaving medicine to lots of people.\nAnd other companies have found that a pricing strategy like that doesn't just raise a lot of moral questions, it's also proved to be a rather poor business strategy when you consider the toll that it's taken on the public reputation and stock price of other pharmaceutical companies.\nSo the administration, and certainly President Obama, has made reducing the cost of prescription drugs a priority, and we have had some success in the context of the Affordable Care Act in limiting the growth in health care costs, including prescription drug costs. But there is certainly more that we could do. And allowing Medicare, for example, to negotiate drug prices is one thing that we could do. And there have been proposals in the President's budget to give the government agency that runs Medicare that kind of authority.\nRepublicans in Congress have resisted that. And that's unfortunate, because we believe that the public would be well-served by taking that kind of step. But Republicans apparently are more committed to serving the interests of the pharmaceutical companies than they are of patients in America.\nQ: Lastly, I want to go back on a question that we talked about yesterday, as it relates to the Iran payments. And I know that you and I talked about this sort of broadly -- just dates back to 1979. It was Iran's money. People have sort of gone over that ground. But what I'm most interested in is this New York Times report, which talked about the 13 payments that were sent each for -- or make that $99,999,999.99. I did reach out to Treasury to try to get just sort of an understanding of why they were using that specific number. At least from the outside it looks like they were trying to avoid some sort of reporting threshold. I think that's a fair curiosity, to say the least.\nAnd so what I wanted to understand from you is also -- the President has previously said that we used hard currency because we didn't have a formal banking relationship with the regime, and yet you talked about a fund from which the Treasury could draw from to send this money. And so I'm just trying to line these up. On the one hand, you're saying the President said himself, we don't have a banking relationship, we had to use currency -- pallets of dollars, or whatever, euros. And yet, we have this fund from which I'm imagining they were able to electronically transfer dollars. Can you explain that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, some of it I can explain. Let's go through a couple of things. The first is, I think it is difficult to make the case that somehow the administration was trying to obscure these payments when the dollar figures that you're citing actually come off a government website that we self-reported. Right? You cited the $99,999,999.99 -- or whatever it is. Good luck with the transcript on that one, Beck.\nQ: But you admit, it sounds like structuring, though. If you think back to basic banking -- and I didn't want to sort of dive into the Speaker Hastert thing -- but if you're trying to give money and it's up to the $10,000, and okay, I'm avoiding the reporting if I stay under the $10,000 threshold, that's kind of what this looks like a little bit. That's why I mentioned it.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I think you're mixing two entirely different things. On the one hand, you've got a former Republican official who was engaged in some nefarious activity. But I guess the point is, he was trying to avoid the attention of law enforcement by structuring his payments in a certain way, and was --\nQ: Or reporting in general, I think is what I was getting at.\nMR. EARNEST: And I guess my point is, we self-reported these payments. They're on a website and that's how you know about them. So I don't think anybody can make the case that somehow we were trying to hide those payments when the fact is we self-reported them.\nBut to go to your second question about the judgment fund, the judgment fund is actually a -- and we can get experts to talk to you about this who know more about this than I do. But this is something that is used at The Hague to essentially settle financial disputes like this. So this fund exists, and that's the pool of money that was used to make this $1.3 billion interest payment that, again, because we were able to settle this dispute for $1.3 billion in interest, we actually did potentially save taxpayers billions more in interest payments.\nQ: Yeah -- like $10 billion or something.\nMR. EARNEST: Right. So that's why we continue to make the case that this is an agreement that is one that's good for the American people on the merits. The fact that this fund exists and is used to make payments for a variety of settlements is separate from the question that you're asking about how exactly the funds were transferred. This is the part that I'm limited in talking about. What we have acknowledged is that we were able to coordinate with a central bank, using the money and these funds, to essentially be a partner of ours in executing this transaction. We have not disclosed the identity of that central bank, primarily because we're trying to protect the privacy of our partners who had essentially done us a favor here.\nThe reason that we had to work with this other central bank is because there are significant limitations that prevent transactions from the U.S. central bank to the Iranian central bank. And those limitations are in place because of this administration's commitment to isolating the Assad regime for their support for terrorism, their menacing of Israel, their frequent violation of human rights, and our concerns about their ballistic missile program not being consistent with United Nations Security Council regulations.\nQ: You meant the regime in Tehran.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, the regime in Tehran. So that's the explanation. I think we have acknowledged all along that the situation is complicated. But the fact that the funds were disclosed on this website and you're asking me about them now I think is an indication of, despite the complexity, we have tried to provide as much information as possible about what exactly happened and to explain to the American people why exactly it's in their interest. And in this case, it saved the American people potentially billions of dollars.\nQ: Last one. I just want to make sure I'm understanding. So from this fund, let's just say the money goes from this fund to a central bank, yet unnamed, and from that bank they convert the money into I guess euros or other currencies, and that's kind of how that ends up on the pallets and on their way to Tehran. Is that kind of how it played out, to the best of your knowledge?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what we have acknowledged is that, generally speaking, that is how the initial $400 million principal payment paid out, was by working with the central bank, we were able to move the currency to Iran. We haven't been as specific about the mechanism of the payment for the $1.3 billion in interest other than to say we had a similar arrangement with a central bank, also unnamed, to move money from the judgment fund to complete the commitments that we had made in the context of this financial settlement.\nQ: Do you think the American people deserve to know about that central bank? Is that an unreasonable expectation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I understand the curiosity that some people may have, but I also think that people can understand why there are a lot of other countries that probably don't want to advertise the ties between their central bank and Iran because Iran is a country that is isolated and they do have a bad reputation. So you can certainly understand the interest that our partners would want to have in protecting their confidentiality. And our ability to work -- our ability to maintain our credibility and work with central banks around the world is contingent upon us living up to our commitments. And we made a commitment to protect their confidentiality, and so that's what we've done.\nMike.\nQ: I'm curious, could you say whether the White House is heartened by Donald Trump's apparent change of heart when it comes to immigration policies that he would pursue as President -- especially since some of the fate of the President's own approaches towards immigration would depend on who becomes President, or whether you take him at his original word for the past year or so as he's been on the campaign trail in terms of what kinds of immigration policies he would pursue if he were to be elected President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mike, I think that the challenge facing the American people as they consider who to support in the next election is to listen carefully to the promises, agenda, and priorities as articulated by the candidates themselves. And the President believes that's how people should make their decision.\nQ: But which ones should they listen to?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think that's what makes that question even more difficult than it otherwise would be. But ultimately it will be up to the American people to take a look.\nLook, the President has made his views pretty clear on this in terms of who he's supporting and why. But the American people are going to have to decide for themselves.\nQ: But specifically on immigration, do you believe that he would now pursue a set of policies that no longer include deportation of all of the undocumented folks here in the country, et cetera?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think people are going to have to decide for themselves. And the truth is, people in both parties are going to have to decide for themselves.\nQ: They might look towards the White House, which has played a leading role on immigration for a long time, for guidance as to --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. And I think the President has made quite clear who he intends to support in the general election. And I think you'll have ample opportunity over the course of the fall to hear him make that case.\nQ: I can't draw you into this.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think so. (Laughter.) I don't think so. But look, I noticed that -- I would expect you won't have any trouble drawing the Republican nominee's Democratic opponent into this debate. I also suspect you won't have any trouble drawing other Republicans into this debate, including people like Senator Cruz, who I saw had some pointed comments about this earlier today, too.\nLook, this is going to be -- people are going to have to work through their own assessment of this situation. And it means paying close attention to the extensive comments that candidates on both sides have made on this issue.\nDave.\nQ: On Syria, the Chairman of the House of Foreign Affairs Committee said that Assad's continued use of chemical weapons has \"made a mockery of the President's red line.\" I wanted to get your reaction to that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Dave, what is clear is that we have seen the Assad regime weaponized an otherwise common industrial compound, chlorine, to carry out acts of indiscriminate violence against his own people. That's consistent with the tactics that we've seen previously, including the targeting of medical facilities and the dropping of barrel bombs out of helicopters, even in places where the Assad regime knows that civilians are located. So this is part and parcel of what we have seen from the Assad regime for years, and it is obviously immoral. It is just the latest in a series of unspeakable acts of violence against innocent people. And it's led to a terrible situation inside that country, and it's threatened to tear that country apart. And it's tragic.\nQ: Obviously, three years ago you had a deal with Russia to eliminate Assad's chemical weapons. Obviously that didn't happen. Does the President regret not having taken more forceful steps at the time to deal with Assad?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, David it is important to draw a distinction between what we indicated that we were prepared to do and had succeeded in doing, which is getting the Assad regime to acknowledge that they had a stockpile of sarin gas, for example. This is a weaponized chemical weapon that they could not legitimately have. And until the United States had engaged in effective diplomacy with Russia, the Assad regime had refused to even acknowledge that they possessed those kinds of chemicals. But because of the tough diplomacy of the United States and Russia, we did succeed in getting them to acknowledge that they had those chemicals, getting them to disclose the whereabouts of those chemicals, and getting them to cooperate with efforts to collect and destroy those chemicals. And that's made the world a safer place. And as bad as the situation is in Syria right now, it would be even worse if we knew that the Assad regime's stockpile of sarin gas, for example, was floating around a country that had essentially been overrun by extremists. But that has not happened because the United States and Russia succeeded in destroying their declared chemical weapons stockpile.\nThat is the situation that we described, and that is what has improved the situation on the ground. Unfortunately, that has not prevented the Assad regime from taking a compound like chlorine and weaponizing it. The Assad's regime creativity in wreaking havoc and violence and bloodshed against innocent people apparently knows no bounds. And that's tragic, and it has rightfully earned the Assad regime international condemnation, vigorous condemnation.\nBut the fact of the matter is, the situation would be even worse and would be even more dangerous to American troops in the region if the declared chemical weapons stockpile that the Assad regime previously had were still in existence. But it's not because of the efforts of the United States and Russia to round up all that Syria declared that they had, and destroyed it.\nQ: Is it the administration's belief that you did get all of his chemical weapons at the time and he made more, or he hid some from everybody, or you just don't know?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we know is that we rounded up and destroyed tons of it. There has been an ongoing investigation by international experts to determine if there is more, and they're still looking. And we should be vigorous about checking that out.\nQ: What else is the administration willing to do at this point to prevent more chemical attacks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think what we have tried to do -- and with mixed success at best -- is to try to deescalate the military conflict inside of Syria, to get countries like Russia and Iran to use their influence with the Assad regime to implement a cessation of hostilities and expedite the kind of political transition that everybody acknowledges is necessary to resolve the situation inside of Syria.\nAnd earlier this year, there were several weeks of time where the cessation of hostilities actually worked better than just about everybody expected. And that did allow for humanitarian organizations to get access to communities in Syria that had been denied it for a long time.\nBut we have seen, especially in places like Aleppo, that cessation of hostilities fray, and that's cost innocent lives. And that's why we continue to make the case to the Russians primarily that they should stop aiding and abetting an Assad regime that's making the situation worse by continuing to claim innocent victims in their military operations.\nAnd we've made the case to Russia that the continued actions of the Assad regime make the situation worse, they exacerbate the chaos, but they're also not in the interest of Russia, and that Russia does risk deepening themselves in the kind of sectarian conflict that's not in their interest.\nSo it's not just a matter of the United States making the case to Russia that they should do the world a favor, but rather making the case to Russia that they need to reconcile the internal contradiction in their strategy, which is -- on the one hand they say that a political transition is necessary inside of Syria, but on the other hand they aid and abet the military operations of the Assad regime that only allow Assad to hold onto power.\nAnd reconciling that internal contradiction is something that Russia is going to have to choose to do at some point. The question is how many people have to die before they do it -- how many innocent people have to die before they do it.\nJC.\nQ: Josh, you've spent a lot of time discussing the public health aspects of Zika and the ensuing panic that's been going on for literally weeks and weeks. But I've heard very little discussion on the fiscal impact that Zika is having, especially on the hotel and tourism business in Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Has the President or anyone from the administration been in touch with the Small Business Administration to ask for additional support, disaster relief through their loan programs, et cetera, to support the very struggling economy right now?\nMR. EARNEST: We have been mindful of this concern, and that's why we've tried to be as specific as possible in describing the risk that individuals in particular neighborhoods of South Florida and in Puerto Rico face. And some of that is driven by a desire to not erroneously raise fears.\nPeople are understandably concerned, and particularly in the neighborhoods that we've identified have legitimate concerns. But we're encouraging people to consult the CDC and their doctor for advice about whether or not to travel to these particular regions, and we do so mindful of the potentially economic impact of this disaster, or at least of this situation.\nI think this goes to why we continue to make the case to Republicans in Congress that there are whole lot of reasons why an effective, robust response to the Zika virus should be properly and adequately funded, and should be funded at the level that our public health professionals say is necessary to do everything possible to stop the spread of the Zika virus. And that's not happened. And that's a tab that Republicans in Congress are responsible for.\nQ: Financially, this is becoming the tourist season in that area, and there are hotels and there are restaurants, et cetera, travel -- folks down there who I've been in touch with who are very frightened that no one is going to show up, basically, because -- and they are losing revenue already. That was my question about the SBA and any kind of funding that is there in place that could be supporting the industries down there.\nMR. EARNEST: There certainly are contingency programs that are maintained by organizations like the SBA. I don't know whether or not they've had to use it in this case yet, but you can check with them about whether or not those funds have been tapped.\nRon.\nQ: Just on Syria. So what you're saying, it sounds like, is that it is still the administration's position that even now there's been confirmation of the use of a chemical weapon -- creatively used chlorine, and confirmation that ISIS has also used chemical weapons there, that the United States -- that the President still does not see a reason or a rationale for an American military response directed at the Syrian regime.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think our approach here has been focused on ISIL. And that's been what the President has perceived as the primary threat.\nQ: Right. And diplomacy, in terms of the Syrian conflict -- and you've said a number of times that the administration does not see a military solution to this. Now, given these chlorine attacks and, as you say, the infinite creativity that -- knowing no bounds, of the Assad regime, it's still the President's position that there is not a military response directed at Syria that is in America's national interest?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there is a military response that's been directed at ISIL, as you know. But our approach to the Assad regime has been to make clear that they've lost legitimacy to lead that country. And that's not just based on our own concerns about the morally reprehensible behavior of Bashar al-Assad, but based on the fact that the people that he's counting on to support his government are people that he's attacked militarily.\nSo it's just not possible, as a practical matter, for him to continue to run the country. Russia shares this assessment. And Russia is the country that has as much influence as anybody else with the Assad regime, because Russia has used their own military might to prop them up.\nAnd so we've made the case to Russia that they should encourage the Assad regime to cease these kind of attacks, agree to the kind of -- live up to the commitments that they made in the context of a cessation of hostilities, and actually pursue the kind of U.N.-led talks that will lead to the political transition that even the Russians acknowledge is necessary.\nQ: And a philosophical question about Syria. We all know the complications of it and the intricacies of it and so forth, and you're probably aware of some of the commentary out there that suggests that this may be the one area where President Obama's legacy is really tarnished, where he should have done more and where, in the months or years ahead, people may look back -- and of course you might dismiss this by saying we'll let history deal with that. But this was the thing that really -- that he didn't deal with that he perhaps should have. Is the President -- he must be aware of that kind of commentary out there. And do you have a sense of what his thoughts are about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has had an opportunity to speak to this a couple of times. And I would vigorously disagree with the suggestion that there is somehow a case that should be made, or can legitimately be made, that the President didn't do anything in Syria.\nThe fact is, the President has built an international coalition with more than 65 members now that has been focused on eradicating the threat from ISIL and other extremists, including al Qaeda's presence in Syria in the form of al Nusra that does pose a threat to the United States and our allies in the West. And we've been very focused on that threat. And there are significant resources that have been mobilized, including militarily, to attack that threat. And we've been able to lead an international coalition and mobilize international resources to confront that threat.\nQ: But not against the regime, and that clearly is the distinction.\nMR. EARNEST: But I guess the point we've made here, Ron -- and this is a lesson that surely we learned from 2003 -- attacking the regime doesn't necessarily address that concern. It just doesn't. And you don't have to take my word for it. We've got a test case just over the border in Iraq about what the consequences are for the United States implementing a regime-change policy and trying to impose a military solution on the situation.\nThat didn't play out well for American interests. And that's what the President has been mindful of throughout this particular situation. I would also point out that the critics that you cite -- and I'm not denying their existence -- but I am suggesting that we haven't seen an alternative solution put forward. There are very few people who are willing to make the case with precision about what the President should be doing instead.\nAnd look, there are some people who do suggest that somehow the United States should invade Syria. They were welcome to make that case. The President doesn't agree with them, and I think they'd be hard-pressed to make the case that that would be in the best interest of the United States. But some of them do.\nBut the truth is, I actually give them credit for having the courage of their convictions as opposed to just standing on the sidelines and criticizing the President, saying the situation in Syria is terrible and saying that it's all the President's fault. The truth is, the situation in Syria is terrible. But they haven't proposed -- put forward their own proposal for what the President should have done instead.\nQ: Let me ask you a follow-up to Michelle's questions about Donald Trump and the African American population and so on. Hyperbole and rhetoric perhaps aside to some extent, the charge is essentially that the African American community is worse off in some ways under President Obama than before, over the last seven or eight years or so. And yes, I know part of the answer is that the unemployment rate has been cut significantly in that particular, community, but there are other measures, as you know, like the rate of poverty, homeownership, median income, and others that are not -- that are worse off.\nSo again, some of the hyperbole aside and some of the rhetoric aside, isn't it a fair criticism that the African American community, minority communities in some ways are worse off now, eight years after President Obama?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, even the Republican leader in the United States Senate acknowledged about a year ago that the American people are better off since President Obama took office. And so I think you'd be very hard-pressed to make a case that somehow the African American population in the United States is somehow not better off based on President Obama's tenure in --\nQ: But there are metrics that suggest that is the case -- homeownership rates, labor force participation rates, the poverty rates. There are 1 and 2 percent changes, but these are significant. And in terms of income inequality, in terms of wage stagnation -- problems that the President has acknowledged exist -- we know that these impact minority communities worse than the mainstream community.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what the President would say is that -- and I would -- I think the point here is, the President has never made the case that the work is finished, that the job is done. I think the point is that President Obama is interested in being succeeded in office by someone who is committed to building on the progress that we've made thus far as opposed to tearing it down.\nAnd the kinds of proposals that have been put forward by the other side would have the effect of eroding our progress, primarily because they would have a devastating impact, fiscally and economically, by doling out significant tax cuts to those at the top of the income scale and leaving the rest of us to pay the tab.\nSo the President believes that that is a strategy that we have tried, and it has not worked. And to go back to that strategy now would make the situation worse and for everybody in America, including the African American population.\nQ: Just one other thing. On the Kabul attack yesterday, is it the assessment that the local security forces performed as they should, and that this awful consequence of 12 or 13 people killed and others -- is it the assessment that the local security force was enough and that the U.S. and coalition troops were not needed to intervene?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we know -- let me start, Ron, by saying that the United States condemns in the strongest terms yesterday's attack on the American University of Afghanistan. And it's apparent that that attack resulted in the deaths of as many as 11 students and security personnel; many others were wounded, of course.\nWe do, in fact, salute the quick work of the Afghan security forces who responded to the attack and secured the university. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were killed. We mourn the loss of innocent -- we mourn the innocent loss of life. And it's an indication that there is additional work that needs to be done to address the security situation in Afghanistan.\nBut the Afghan security forces are making progress, and they are making that progress both because of their commitment to fight for their country, but also because of the support that they're receiving from U.S. and NATO trainers and advisors who have helped them improve their performance in securing the country.\nStephanie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. This is also in regards to the -- my question is also in regards to the attack on American University in Kabul. Yesterday you said the attack highlights the huge challenge facing the people of Afghanistan, particularly as it relates to their security situation -- as you mentioned, the number of folks that died there. Earlier in the month two professors were kidnapped. This school has been threatened for years. Is security improving at all in that region? Do you have any specifics as to how?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any metrics to provide you. We'll see if we can try and provide some statistics to help you understand the situation there better.\nI think what is clear is that we see security ebb and flow through -- across the country; that where the Afghan security forces are able to make progress in one area, we see the extremists in that country, including the Taliban, try to capitalize on weakness somewhere else. And it's a constant push and pull.\nBut I think over the long-term trajectory, there's no denying the important progress that's been made. And given the situation in Afghanistan even five or six years ago, the progress that's been made is undeniable. And it's going to require patience, but also determination, to extend this progress. And the Afghan people and the Afghan government should know that they will have the ongoing, resolute support of the United States and our coalition partners as they address the security situation in their country.\nQ: Earlier in the month, a U.S. soldier died in that same region while advising an Afghan Special Operations unit with another 100 U.S. troops sent to Helmand Province to train, advise and assist the local police there. How much longer will these soldiers need to train, advise and assist? I mean, any idea when they'll be pulled out and Afghan forces will be able to manage this on their own? And will it just revert back to what the situation was years ago?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what's likely is the next President is going to have to make some decisions about this. President Obama has pursued an approach where he has consulted closely with his national security team, including his military advisors, including his commanders on the ground in Afghanistan, to ensure that the strategy that he's implemented reflects the situation on the ground. And that's why we have succeeded.\nYou'll recall early in President Obama's tenure in office, there were more than 100,000 U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan. Now there are a little less than 9,000, I believe. That's a pretty significant drawdown, and does reflect important progress that our military has made in that country, and it reflects the important progress that Afghan forces have made in that country.\nBut there still is a threat, there still is a risk. And it's one that Afghan forces, with the advice and assistance of U.S. forces, is working to counter.\nQ: And the President is scheduled to meet with Defense Secretary Ash Carter. Can you provide a preview of what the President will be talking about with Ash Carter? Is there anything specific they'll discuss, or is this just a standard --\nMR. EARNEST: This is part of the regular weekly meeting that President Obama has with his Defense Secretary when both of them are in town. It's been a couple weeks since they've both been in town, so it will be an opportunity for them to meet. I suspect -- I don't know whether or not they'll have an opportunity to meet next week, but I would anticipate that the President's upcoming trip to Asia will factor into their discussions.\nAnd I know that Secretary Carter has traveled quite extensively to Asia on more than one occasion over the last six months or so, so I would anticipate that that would be part of their agenda. But this is -- the meeting was not called to address any emergent need, but rather to cover the range of issues that they cover on a weekly basis when both of them are in town.\nQ: And last question. Colombia's government and the country's biggest rebel group, they reached a peace deal. We saw that statement released just about an hour ago. What contributions, if any, did the U.S. make in the peace process between Colombia and this rebel group?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously the United States is quite pleased to see the longest-running war in the Western Hemisphere come to an end. And for years, the United States has been an important partner of the Colombian government as they've tried to bring this conflict to an end. And this is I think an indication of the United States being able to work effectively with an international partner even across party lines; that President Bush invested a lot in this effort to support the Colombian government, and the Obama administration, if anything, doubled down on that commitment and continued to support them.\nAnd the kind of success that the Colombian government and the Colombian people have enjoyed in trying to resolve this conflict benefitted from the important contribution made by the American government and the American people, and that's certainly -- this is certainly going to be an important part of President Obama's legacy, but it's going to be an important part of President Bush's legacy, too. He deserves credit for the work that he had done in this area.\nI would also note that the Cuban government played an important role in facilitating the end to this conflict. And the improved relationship between the United States and Cuba I think could only have helped advance that process even further.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Yesterday on CNN, Secretary Clinton said that Donald Trump is taking a hate movement mainstream, and she's going to give a speech about his embrace of a so-called \"alt-right movement.\" I'm wondering, does the White House share her sentiments about Donald Trump and his commentary?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'll let the candidates make their own case and offer up their own opinions about the tactics that are employed by either side.\nI think what is clear is that there has been a willingness on the part of Republicans in Congress to appeal to extremists in this country to try to build political support for their party. We talked about the Zika funding bill being saddled with a provision that relates to the display of the Confederate flag. House Republicans elected into their leadership somebody who described himself as \"David Duke without the baggage.\"\nWe've seen Republicans come forward and support -- Republicans in Congress come forward and support religious tests on people who enter the United States to try to keep people of the Muslim faith out of the country. We've seen Republicans in Congress support voting rights measures that some states have implemented to disenfranchise minority voters. The circuit court in North Carolina recently found that a Republican bill was almost surgically focused on preventing black Americans from voting. And all that's been supported by Republicans in Congress. In fact, Republicans in Congress have opposed to renewal of the Voting Rights Act that would give the federal government tools to try to address those kinds of obvious inequities.\nSo there's a long track record of the cynical political tactics of congressional Republicans to appeal to extremists to move their agenda forward and to win elections. And this is something that we've talked about quite a few times, and I think it's why you see a lot of Republicans, not just here in Washington, D.C. but across the country, quite concerned about the state of their party. And the years-long willingness of leading Republicans to engage in these kinds of cynical tactics appears to be taking a toll on their party.\nQ: I wanted to ask about recent reports that four Iranian vessels intercepted a U.S. destroyer on the Strait of Hormuz. Do you have anything on that? Can you comment on whether or not you can confirm that and any reaction?\nMR. EARNEST: I know that my colleagues at the Department of Defense talked about this a little bit yesterday, and we are aware that four Iranian vessels approached USS Nitze while it was transiting international waters in the Strait of Hormuz. As my colleagues at the Pentagon noted yesterday, they assessed that the actions taken by these Iranian vessels were unsafe and unprofessional. At this point, it's not clear what the intentions of the Iranian ships were, but the behavior is not acceptable, given that this U.S. ship was in international waters. These types of actions and incidents are concerning and they have the potential to unnecessarily escalate tensions.\nNow, I know that there was a similar incident last month involving a ship that CENTCOM Commander General Votel was aboard. This was the USS New Orleans. General Votel noted that the Strait of Hormuz is a relatively compressed space, and that exacerbates the potential for miscalculations on either side. The United States is not seeking to escalate the already volatile situation in that region of the world, and we don't want anybody else to either.\nKate.\nQ: Tomorrow -- this is sort of a lighter note -- a film comes out in theaters called \"Southside with You.\" It's a date movie about the President and First Lady. Obviously it's a sitting President. Has he seen it yet? I know the MPAA sent a copy over to the White House. Have they had a chance to see the film? Do you know what he thinks about it?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not talked to him about the film and I don't know whether or not he's seen it. But I'll see if we can get you some information about that.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I just wanted to get back to the Vice President's comments that he made today to reporters in Sweden. He said that it's his hope and expectation that the detention facility at Guantanamo is closed by the end of the President's time in office. I get the hope part. The expectation part I'm a little confused about. I understand, as you do, that the President has signed into law legislation which prohibits any detainee at Guantanamo from being transferred to U.S. soil. So with the expectation part, explain to me how that actually would work.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I think in answer to Michelle's question on this, we have seen Congress -- you just alluded to them -- erect significant barriers to our success in achieving this foreign policy goal that Democrats and Republicans alike agree is worthwhile.\nQ: There's bipartisan opposition, actually, that's opposed to closing Guantanamo.\nMR. EARNEST: There's bipartisan opposition in Congress. There's bipartisan --\nQ: -- votes. That's who actually decides whether Guantanamo remains open; not people that are out of office.\nMR. EARNEST: I understand that, but there are bipartisan experts who have dedicated their lives to protecting the interest of the United States around the world, including leaders in our military who agree that this is a foreign policy priority worth achieving. So there is strong bipartisan support among foreign policy experts for it.\nYou're right -- the people who are playing politics don't share that view. That includes Democrats and Republicans. So we're going to have to work through that political opposition. And I can't sketch forward the path for you. I don't know exactly what that path looks like. But the President is determined to make progress and accomplish this goal before he leaves.\nQ: So do you not share the Vice President's optimism that the prison at Guantanamo Bay will be closed in January of 2017?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I would say is that your pessimism is understandable, but we're in the business of hope around here.\nQ: That's good. And as it relates to Guantanamo -- I know you are. (Laughter.) As it relates to Guantanamo, Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate early on in the President's time in office. Why was is that Guantanamo was not closed during those first two years of the President's first term?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, the President was disappointed early on that we weren't able to make more progress. We've acknowledged that previously as well. But look, at some point, Democrats and Republicans are going to have to come together in Congress to do the right thing for the country. And I'm not diminishing or trying to dismiss some of the political concerns that have been raised by some, but those political concerns are rooted in individual members' of Congress own reelection. At some point, our national security has to take precedence over that, and the President will be making that case, and he'll be making that case to Democrats and Republicans.\nLalit.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. I would like to take it back to Afghanistan. The President of Afghanistan had issued a statement today in which he says the attack on the American university was organized and orchestrated by people inside Pakistan. And he also called the Pakistan army chief, General Raheel Sharif, asking him to take action against those terrorists. What do you make of this statement?\nMR. EARNEST: Lalit, I haven't seen those comments. Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, we condemn in the strongest terms yesterday's attack. I'm not aware of any specific assessment that the United States has drawn about who, ultimately, was responsible for that attack. But we'll obviously be in touch with leaders in the Afghan government as they investigate this situation and take steps that are necessary to try to prevent it from happening again.\nQ: And next week, Secretary Kerry is traveling to India for the last Strategic and Commercial Dialogue of this administration with India. This kind of dialogue was started by this administration. Do you think -- what does the President think about the progress met in the India-U.S. bilateral ties -- despite the progress that has been done?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has devoted significant time and resources to strengthening the relationship between the United States and India. The President has visited India on three *two occasions, I believe, and each of those trips has been dedicated to strengthening the political relationship between the world's two largest democracies but also trying to strengthen further the economic ties between our two countries. The President believes that more effective cooperation between our two countries can improve the economy in both of our countries, create jobs and promote economic growth. And I know that Prime Minister Modi shares those goals. And the President has found Prime Minister Modi to be an effective interlocutor and partner in pursuing those goals. And the President is pleased about the progress that we've made over the first seven and a half years of his presidency, and we're going to spend the remaining five months or so here trying to do all we can to advance it even further.\nQ: And are you meeting -- (inaudible) meeting the President and the Prime Minister in China on the sidelines of the G20?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any bilateral meetings that President Obama will engage in to announce at this point. We're obviously still putting together the schedule for the President's trip, and we'll keep you posted on that.\nJared, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. In the past, not very much recently, the President has said that gun control should be a single issue through which voters examine their priorities come November. Earlier this week, Americans for Responsible Solutions endorsed Senators Toomey and Kirk. The President and Vice President have endorsed their challengers, McGinty and Duckworth, respectively. Is this just people who disagree about that single issue lens? Or what explains the sunlight between the President and someone like former Congresswoman Giffords?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think they're basically going to draw their own conclusions about this. I think the promise that the President made was to not support anyone that didn't share his commitment to common-sense gun control safety -- or gun-safety legislation. And you referenced Congresswoman Duckworth and Ms. McGinty -- those are two candidates that enthusiastically share President Obama's commitment to those common-sense notions that we know would have an impact, a positive impact in reducing gun violence in this country. That's why the President went forward with endorsing them, and that's the decision that the President and Vice President made together.\nQ: Former Congresswoman Giffords and her organization believe that Senators Toomey and Kirk would also work to make sure that common-sense gun reform -- and specifically cite their work after the Connecticut shooting and talk about how they supported legislation and they're willing to put that endorsement behind them. Does the President agree that these are two people that he could work with? He won't be around, obviously, for their next term, but is it someone that the next President should be able to work with to work on gun reforms?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would acknowledge that I have not scrutinized the records of the two senators that you mentioned on the issue of gun safety.\nQ: Isn't the word of Congresswoman Giffords good enough for the White House on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, she's drawing her own assessment and they're certainly entitled to do that. The President's decision in both of these races was rooted in the priorities and agenda that have been identified by both candidates, Congresswoman Duckworth and Ms. McGinty. And that agenda doesn't just include their strong and enthusiastic support for common-sense gun-safety legislation but it also includes their strong support for a variety of other measures, including things like job-training and support for efforts to tackle climate change and expanding economic opportunity for everybody, including middle-class families. That's the reason that the President supported those two candidates. And, again, everybody is going to have to draw their own conclusions and make their own decisions about that.\nQ: Since the President is no longer using just gun control to decide who to support in these races, should people not look --\nMR. EARNEST: No, no, no -- I never suggested that that was going to be the case.\nQ: Well, the President said it should be a single issue for voters.\nMR. EARNEST: And that's why, if there are candidates who don't --\nQ: He's taking other issues into account.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, Jared, I think you're making it more complicated than it actually is. So we'll leave it there.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 12:50 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-08-25", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121173", "text": "VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (In progress) -- thoughtful consideration when I lost my son. It was appreciated very much. We've known each other for a long time.\nI came today for multiple reasons. Most of all, Mr. President, to express my personal condolences and the condolences of my country for the brutal, unconscionable attack in Turkey, the very spot where the Islamic State (inaudible.)\nThe attempted coup went to the heart of who your people are -- principled, courageous and committed. And for a people who have struggled so long to establish a true democracy, this was, from my perspective and the President's perspective, the ultimate affront. So my heart goes out to not just the government, but to the Turkish people.\nIt's hard to imagine a Turkish fighter jet that would zero in on your parliament, or helicopters, Mr. President, attacking (inaudible), where you and your family were 15 minutes earlier. It's hard to fathom. It's hard for Americans to picture the possibility that a U.S. military helicopter would be (inaudible) when they thought the President was on vacation with his family.\nI saw some of the damage myself today, meeting some of the members of your parliament, including the Speaker. I was told, as I came into this magnificent building, that if I were to go out to my left -- or right as I came in -- that I would see a bullet hole in the faзade of this building, as well. I can understand, Mr. President, how some of your countrymen would feel that the world didn't respond to the existential crisis your country was facing rapidly enough, or with the appropriate amount of solidarity and compassion and empathy. And that's why, Mr. President -- you've known me for a while -- that's why I wanted to personally be here, and was asked by the President to personally be here to represent, to tell you and all of your colleagues and your countrymen how very, very, very sorry I am, the President is, the American people are for the suffering and loss you have endured.\nYou gave me an example in our private meeting on -- you said a very friend of yours who named his son after you, he and his son were killed in this coup. This is not something that is distant. It's not something that is always read about in history books. It's personal. It's personal. And I want to make sure -- I want to make unmistakably clear that the United States stands with our ally, Turkey. We support the people of Turkey. And our support is absolute and it is unwavering.\nAs I said in the press statement earlier today, this attempted coup was an attack on the people of Turkey -- not just the government -- on the people of Turkey and their most cherished values. It was a violent betrayal by a small group of folks who were sworn to defend the very people that they say they care and love.\nWe've stood with you from the moment it began, Mr. President, and we stand with you now. We are your allies. The American people also stand in awe of the way your countrymen respond to the way you respond personally -- going on the Internet through, my guess is on Facebook -- I'm not sure which vehicle you used -- with a portable -- or with a cellphone, telling your people to rise up, take back the street, do not let these terrorists, which is what they ended up being, steal their patronage, their -- who they are.\nAnd it was amazing as the world watched. They went through the streets. As I said to you earlier, I can't imagine -- they probably had no idea whether another F-16 jet would come flying over; whether all of a sudden as they marched out to make their views known, whether a helicopter would rise up and gun them down. The world saw Turkish patriots, ordinary citizens, who -- literally standing in front of tanks -- standing in front of tanks. To the best of my knowledge -- I don't think I'm incorrect -- some of them actually got run over by those tanks.\nAs I said, I personally, the President personally, the American people stand in awe of the courage of your people. And we understand, Mr. President, the sensitivities the Turkish people feel about international security. That's why the United States is committed to doing everything we can to help bring justice for all those responsible for this coup attempt while adhering to the rule of law.\nAs I said -- and I personally, the President personally, the American people stand in awe of the courage of your people. And what we saw, Mr. President, is the sensitivity that the Turkish people feel about their national security. That's why the United States is committed to doing everything we can to help through your justice hold all those responsible for this coup attempt while adhering to the rule of law. As I said earlier, even as we speak, our American experts are on the ground, here in Ankara, meeting with your people, closely coordinating with our Turkish counterparts to evaluate and gather the material with regard to Turkish requests to extradite Gulen, in accordance with our bilateral extradition treaty. We have more lawyers working on this case than any other extradition in recent history. And I've been around a long time, Mr. President. I've been in the Congress for a long time. I was head of the Judiciary Committee. I know of no other case where as much time is being spent to make sure we find enough data to meet a court standing.\nI know it's hard -- I don't know -- I suspect it's hard for people to understand that as powerful as my country is, as powerful as Barack Obama is as President, he has no authority under our Constitution to extradite anyone. Only a federal court can do that. Nobody else can do that. If the President were to take this into his own hands, what would happen would be he would be impeached for violating the separation of powers.\nAnd so, Mr. President, it's not that we have any reason -- and your people should know -- any reason to protect Gulen or anyone else who, in fact, may have done something wrong. As a matter of fact, you'll recall, Mr. President, when Gulen sought refuge in America, the Bush administration denied him. He went to court. It was the court that overruled the President of the United States of America allowing him to do this.\nSo, Mr. President, this case, like all others, is going to have to be assessed by an independent federal court along with evidence backing it up. That's what we're working on together now. And it takes time to work an extradition request, but there should be no doubt that we'll continue to work closely with the Turkish government as this process unfolds.\nThe people of Turkey have no greater friend than the United States of America. As I said earlier, I want to offer my personal condolences and those of the President to the people of Turkey for not only what they went through in the coup attempt, but shortly after that over 50 people murdered apparently, from what we're told, by ISIS in a suicide bombing -- 28 or 29 young people under the age of 18 were killed. The suffering of your people at the hands of ISIS, at the hands of the PKK in the southeastern part of your country is beyond what any people should have to sustain. The barbarism is horrifying. But neither the Turkish people nor, might I add, Mr. President, the American people -- neither of us ever balk, ever bend, ever yield to terrorist threats or terrorist action.\nSo, Mr. President, we've always had good conversations. Today was no exception. I look forward to continue to work together with you and your team, and as we find even more ways for our nations to keep expanding our partnership, and jointly taking on this mindless terrorist activity that goes on around the world.\nLet me say it for one last time: The American people stand with you. We (inaudible). Barack Obama was one of the first people you called. But I do apologize. I wish I could have been here earlier. I wish I could have been here earlier. But, Mr. President, we admire your people and we admire the way in which you're standing up to all this difficulty.\nPRESIDENT ERDOGAN: (As interpreted.) First and foremost, thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, distinguished members of the press, valuable guests, I would like to salute you all with my most heartfelt emotions.\nVice President of the United States of America, Mr. Joe Biden, bestowed upon us the pleasure of hosting him in our country for the second time this year. Of course, this current visit coincided with an extraordinary time during an extraordinary process, which saddens me, actually. I wish that we could have greeted each other under the most normal circumstances instead of what prevailed currently.\nI would like to welcome him once again to our capital city, to our country, especially -- the failed coup that took place on the 15th of July, those traitors who are members of the Fethullah Terrorist Organization in armed forces uniform tried to topple the government, but couldn't achieve their objectives thanks to a very different resistance put forth by the people of our nation. And those heinous attempts were repelled by this firm stance assumed by the people of my country that I'm extremely proud of.\nIn the hands of the Fethullah terrorists, there were F-16 fighter jets. They had helicopters, they had tanks, and they had cannons at their disposals. However, in the hands of my people, in the hands of my citizens, all they had were their flags. And with those flags, they were marching towards the tanks, joining their faith with their hearts. And in a mere period of 12 hours, they have completely repelled this heinous, failed coup.\nThat's why I would like to take this opportunity to once again extend my gratitude to my people and commemorate our martyrs, and remember our veterans. The number of the martyrs reached 241, as we speak, and the number of the veterans has reached 2,194. I hope and pray that they will be able to recover soon.\nFrom a 15-year-old child to an elderly member of this society around the age of 70 to 75, men and women, they took a firm stance against this attempted coup. This was an articulation of a very extraordinary situation. This was the communication of a very different attitude of our people against these traitors, because democracy could only survive if people of this nation embraced her fully. My people embraced democracy fully so that we can continue our march the way we do.\nOur strategic partnership with the United States of America, they date back a long time in history. We have transitioned from a strategic partnership to a model partnership under the office of President Obama. And within the framework of the model partnership that we've enjoyed, we've erected our endeavors on a very different foundation. And with the current visit paid to Turkey by Vice President Biden, we've had the opportunity to discuss this failed coup at every extent possible. And the Vice President had the opportunity to visit in situ the parliament to observe the repercussions of this attempt. And I'm going to submit him some additional documents after this meeting, and he will be able to firsthandedly observe the feelings of the Turkish nation on this individual who is called Fethullah Gulen.\nDistinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, this incident -- which took place on the eve of July the 15th -- and in the aftermath of this failed coup, the resistance of our people flourished in a very different manner. And I believe this failed coup yielded some very positive results at the same time, primarily because of all of the political factions in Turkey, all of the opposition parties, and all of the members of the society reunited. This was a very important opportunity for us all.\nThroughout our talks with Vice President Biden, we've stated once again that we are very much committed to fighting against this FETO terrorist organization, and we've discussed what kind of measures we were determined to take. First and foremost, this leader of the FETO terrorist organization needs to be extradited to Turkey as soon as possible. That is the first measure that needs to be taken. There are references made to the verdicts to be issued by courts, and we have previously submitted all of the folders regarding the actions engaged in by these terrorists before July the 15th. And right now, we are amassing certain documents pointing out to their involvement in this failed coup that took place on July the 15th.\nBut between the United States and Turkey, there is a bilateral extradition treaty. And in light of this extradition treaty, those individuals should be taken into pretrial detention, they should be arrested, and throughout the trial they need to remain in custody. This person, however, is currently managing and directing the terrorist organization where he lives. They are present in more than 170 countries around the world, and they are present through school associations and other sorts of educational institutions. Many individuals were taken into the Pennsylvanian premises, where he resides.\nAnd similarly, he is still providing interviews to media outlets in the United States. Some journalists are being taken into the Pennsylvania residence, and he is still continuing his actions around the world, and he's shaping his actions for the future using these outlets. That's why it is very important for him to be contained through pretrial detention, which is actually part of the bilateral extradition treaty that was signed between our two countries, which we should not ignore. And that is something I especially feel that I need to remind you of. And I'm confident that the United States will take the necessary measures to cater to our expectations in that regard.\nThroughout our discussions with Vice President Biden, we've also discussed the developments in Syria and our fight against Daesh, which is a primary issue in our region. Today, certain operations were conducted within Jarabulus in Syria. Jarabulus is about 20 to 30 kilometers away from our border to Syria. It is a province, strategic province, where attacks were directed to our Karkemish district right on the Syrian border. We were heavily disturbed of the attacks that were forwarded to us from that province in Syria. And we couldn't communicate to ourselves in the best manner possible, I assume, and that's why we felt not understood. And so eventually we decided to perform an operation on the province of Jarabulus with the aid of coalition forces who have entered the Jarabulus province, and the members of the Free Syrian Army and the local Jarabulus residents managed to liberate that entire province from Daesh.\nAll of the public institutions and all of the official headquarters were immediately liberated from the hands of Daesh fighters. And Daesh troops were forced to evict Jarabulus immediately after these operations that we had undertaken. Whether it be PYD, where it be PKK, whether it be YPG, whether it be the HKPC, or whether it be ISIS, all of these organizations are terrorists in our point of view. Al Nusra, al Shabaab -- regardless of their origins -- are terrorist organizations. There is not a good terrorist organization and an evil terrorist organization. We can't make a distinction between them like that. They're all terrorist organizations at the end of the day, and terrorists will be terrorists regardless of our mentalities.\nIf one terrorist organization is fighting against another terrorist organization, it doesn't help them wash their hands clean out of the actions they have engaged in. A terrorist organization cannot impose a threat on the homeland security of a nation. However, (inaudible) are shattering our hearts into fragments, and we don't want to see those pictures appearing any longer, and we don't want this suffering to continue of the Syrian people anymore. Because we believe that the Syrians should be governed by a person elected depending on their own will.\nSyria can no longer be governed by an individual to whom the people of Syria says no. Syria, led by Assad, will never embrace democracy or stability. Assad has been engaging in state terrorism that resulted in the death of 600,000 civilians. Assad is a tyrant. And I know that the United States will become more sensitive towards these developments. And I believe the United States will provide the support that is required out on the field. And I know that Vice President Biden had very extensive talks with our Prime Minister, and I am sure he was engaged in very fruitful talks all throughout the day.\nAnd before I conclude my remarks, I would like to welcome him and thank him once again for being in our capital city, for being in our country. Now we are ready to receive one question from the medias of each countries, and then we will conclude our press statement.\nThank you. First, we will hand the microphone over to our guests. Thank you.\nQ Thank you. Mr. Vice President, the U.S. is now flying with Turkey in the Jarabulus offensive. Can you talk a little bit about what that means for U.S.-backed Kurds and the overall operation in Syria against the Islamic State?\nAnd, President Erdogan, U.S. officials have indicated that it could take years to work through your extradition request. You just said that you want this to happen as soon as possible. How is that difference going to affect the relationship going forward?\nThank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: In terms of the operation in Jarabulus, we strongly support what the Turkish military has organized and done. We've been flying air cover for them. We have known for some time that Daesh -- ISIL -- is there. And we believe very strongly that the Turkish border must be controlled by Turkey, that there should be no occupation of that border by any group whatsoever, that Syria must be whole and united, not carved into little pieces. And we have been -- we hope to continue to work with Turkey closely on continued operations that will root out Daesh. But we're supportive of the operation. I hope that answers your question.\nPRESIDENT ERDOGAN: (As interpreted.) In addition to what Vice President Biden stated, I must say that I fully agree with his questions. If we can correct something in the meanwhile it would be proper. We can't call this an Islamic state. And the Vice President had already corrected the name of this terrorist organization as Daesh, because they should be called Daesh. They should not be associated with Islam. The Islamic State cannot be associated with terrorism. Daesh is a terrorist organization. They are terrorists. Islam is a derivative of the word \"peace,\" or the prefix \"peace\" stands for Islam, which is a derivative of Islam. A member of the Islamic faith can never engage in these massacres, in this carnage. They wouldn't use 13- or 14-year-old boys as suicide bombers. But however, Daesh is doing that, and they will pay a hefty price in return. Rest assured that that is going to be the case so long as us, looking for peace and yearning for peace, can join their forces and forge a close solidarity.\nQ (As interpreted.) I have a question for Vice President Biden. After the September 11 attacks, the United States attached great significance to fighting against terrorism, and sometimes the United States asked for assistance from Turkey. Turkey, without resorting to any bureaucracy or any legal issue, extended a helping hand.\nBut right now there is a person who is charged with plotting this coup. Your ambassador in Ankara and the chief of general staff believe that Gulen is behind these failed coup attempts. And after these issues, do you think the United States and our administration is lingering things? Do you think the American action will keep on bothering the Turkish public or the conscientious of Turkish public? Because instead of moving on, I think everything is left in the hands of time, and you're just giving it time. How would you comment on this, and how do you think -- or how long do you think Gulen will be allowed to remain in your country and still keep on voicing threats upon our country using media outlets? Thank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It's a simple proposition in America. We are a nation of laws. We are bound by a constitution. And we are sworn to uphold that constitution. The constitution and our laws require for someone to be extradited, that the court in the United States has to conclude with probable cause to be extradited. Not only do we apply that standard as it relates to extradition; we apply that standard every day we do our country.\nFor example, you've read of three or four terrorist attacks that have recently taken place in my country. The FBI had followed two of these people. One of these people had said that he'd like to see Americans killed. He was a proponent of Daesh. He had sworn to Daesh. Notwithstanding the fact he said that under our law, there was no direct threat against anyone, there was no ability to detain him. He ended up going out and killing people.\nWe mean what we say when we say we apply the law without exception -- without exception. What we're doing now is we have a team of our lawyers and experts who were here in Ankara yesterday, sitting down with your experts on the judiciary and your prosecutors, saying, give us the data we need in order to be able to bring these to a court of law that will say, yes, we must extradite you.\nWe have zero interest. What possible interest could the United States have in wanting to protect someone who, in fact, met the standard under our law of being deported? What possible motive could we have? How could that even be thought to be possible? So we are bound by the law. Our judicial system is not only different than Turkey's; it's different from France's, it's different than Germany's. It's different, but it is our system we have abided by for over 225 years. Nothing will change that. How long it will take will depend upon how much evidence is able to be presented.\nThus far, until yesterday, there has been no evidence presented about the coup -- the coup. When you go to an American court, you can't go into a court and say, this is a bad guy, generally. You have to say this is a guy or a woman who committed the following explicit crime. That's what we're working with the President right now to gather the evidence that will establish in a court of law probable cause to believe he may have done this. We are determined -- we are determined to listen to every scrap of evidence that Turkey can provide or that we can find out about.\nBut again, I say to the people of Turkey: What possible motive could we have to, in fact, harbor a terrorist? Why would we do that? It makes absolutely no sense. None whatsoever. We are bound by the law. The President is bound by the law. The court will decide. As soon as we have enough evidence, it will be present to a court, and the court will then decide. And I cannot speak for a court.\nLastly -- and I'm sorry for the long answer, Mr. President -- but lastly, under our system, the federal court is a co-equal branch -- not subservient to, not underneath, but equal -- equal to the Congress, equal to the President. That's what we call separation of powers. That's our system. We will abide by our system. We will continue to abide by the system. And God willing, there will be enough data and evidence to be able to meet the criteria that you all believe exists. We have no reason to shelter someone who would attack an ally and try to overthrow a democracy. Can you imagine us being happy with another military state? We didn't get on so well with your previous military states. So what motive could we possibly have? None. Except we're bound by the law.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2016-08-25", "title": "Remarks to the Press by the Vice President and President Erdogan of Turkey in Ankara, Turkey"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122627", "text": "\"We've got to make it easier for people to save for retirement . . . So I've called on the Department of Labor and Tom Perez to propose a set of rules by the end of the year to provide a clear path forward for states to create retirement savings programs. And if every state did this, tens of millions more Americans could save for retirement at work.\"\n– President Barack Obama, Remarks at the White House Conference on Aging, July 13, 2015\nAfter a lifetime of hard work, Americans should be able to enjoy a secure and dignified retirement. While Social Security is and must remain a rock-solid benefit that all Americans can rely on, too many Americans reach retirement age without enough savings to supplement their Social Security checks – in part because many Americans don't have a way to save for retirement at work.\nAt last year's White House Conference on Aging, the President directed the Department of Labor (DOL) to issue rules providing states looking to create their own retirement savings plans with a path forward consistent with federal law. The Department issued proposed rules in November, and today finalized those rules. This marks a major step towards ensuring that every American can save for retirement at work and better prepare for their golden years.\nEight states – California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, Massachusetts, and Washington – have already passed legislation creating their own retirement savings arrangements. These states have taken action, even while Congress has failed to move forward on thePresident's federal budget proposal to automatically enroll workers who don't have access to a workplace savings plan in an IRA. Today's rule addresses concerns raised by some about preemption or coverage by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), provides a path forward consistent with federal law, and will enable even more states to create their own programs. The Department is also announcing a proposed rule that would allow some larger cities to establish their own retirement savings programs.\n•      All Americans Should Be Able to Save for Retirement at Work: We know how to get people to save for retirement: provide them with access to a workplace savings plan and automatically enroll them in that plan. But about one third of all workers do not have access to a retirement savings plan through their employer. To help their residents save, eight states have passed laws creating their own retirement savings programs. DOL's final rule clarifies the status of existing efforts, and will enable more states to create their own.\n•      DOL's Final Rule Facilitates State Efforts to Create Retirement Savings Programs By Providing a Path Forward Consistent with Federal Pension Law: Specifically, the rule provides that a state retirement savings program is not an ERISA plan and hence unlikely to be preempted by ERISA if the program is established and administered by the state, provides for a limited employer role, and is voluntary for employees.\n•      Proposed Rules Would Enable Some Larger Cities to Create Retirement Savings Plans: Under the proposed rule, a city can create its own retirement savings program provided it has the authority under state law, its population is equal to or greater than the population of the least populous state, and the state does not have its own retirement savings program.\nAll Americans Should Be Able to Save for Retirement at Work\nWhile Social Security is and must remain a rock-solid benefit that all Americans can rely on, too many Americans reach retirement age without enough savings to supplement their Social Security checks. In fact, fewer than one third of individuals aged 65 to 74 have any savings in a retirement account, and those that do have a median savings balance of just $49,000. For older Americans, inadequate retirement savings can mean sacrificing or skimping on food, housing, health care, transportation, and other necessities. Inadequate retirement savings places greater stress on state and federal social welfare programs as guaranteed sources of income and economic security for older Americans.\nThe good news is that we know how to get people to save for retirement: provide them with access to a workplace savings plan and automatically enroll them in that plan. But about one third of all workers do not have access to a workplace savings plan through their employers. Workers without access to a plan at work rarely save for retirement on their own: fewer than 10 percent of workers without access to a workplace plan contribute to a retirement savings account.\nThat's why in every budget since taking office, the President has proposed to automatically enroll workers in an IRA if they don't have access to a workplace plan. But in the absence of Congressional action,  eight states have passed laws to create state-administered retirement savings programs for private-sector workers. Some of those state laws (sometimes referred to as \"state auto-IRA\" laws) require employers that do not offer workplace savings arrangements to automatically enroll their employees in payroll deduction IRAs administered by the states. Although other states are considering similar measures, uncertainty about potential preemption by ERISA has impeded broader adoption of such programs. Today's final rule addresses these concerns, clarifying the status of existing efforts and enabling more states to create their own programs.\nToday's announcement builds on the Administration's ongoing efforts to make it easier to save for retirement, and protect families who have done the hard work of saving for retirement. In 2014, the Department of Treasury launched myRA, a simple, safe, no-fee, and portable savings option aimed at individuals without access to a workplace savings plan. And this spring, the Department of Labor finalized rules requiring financial advisers to provide advice that is truly in their clients' best interest. These rules will help eliminate conflicts of interest that cost savers $17 billion each year.\nDOL's Final Rule Facilitates State Efforts to Create Retirement Savings Programs\nThe final rule outlines the circumstances in which state retirement savings programs would not be treated as creating ERISA-covered pension plans, giving states legal comfort by reducing the risk that the state laws would be invalidated based on ERISA preemption.\nIn order to qualify under the final rule, a state program must be:\n•      Established and administered by the state. The program must be established pursuant to state law, and implemented and administered by the state. The state must be responsible for investing the employee savings, for selecting investment alternatives from which employees may choose, and for the security of payroll deductions and employee savings. The state may choose to contract with service providers to administer the program.\n•      Provide for a limited employer role. Employer activity must be limited to ministerial activities such as collecting payroll deductions, remitting them to the program, providing official state program notices to employees, maintaining records of payroll deductions and remittance of payments, providing information to the state necessary for the operation of the program, and distributing state program information to employees. Employers cannot contribute employer funds to the IRAs. Importantly, employer participation in the program must be required by state law, not voluntary.\n•      Voluntary for employees. Because the program must be voluntary for employees even if it requires automatic enrollment, employees must be given adequate advance notice and have the right to opt out. In addition, employees must be notified of their rights under the program and how to enforce their rights.\nProposed Rules Would Enable Some Larger Cities to Create Retirement Savings Plans\nIn response to public comments, the Department is also announcing a proposed regulation that would expand the final rule discussed above to cover qualified city and county programs. To be qualified, the city or county must have the authority to require employer participation in a payroll deduction savings program. In addition, the city or county must have a population at least equal to that of the least populous state, and may not be in a state that has a state-wide retirement savings program for private-sector employees. The proposal solicits comments on, among other things, whether the final rule should be expanded in this manner, what limitations should be imposed on the size or types of political subdivisions that would qualify, and whether the final rule's conditions should differ in any way if applied to political subdivisions.", "timestamp": "2016-08-25", "title": "Fact Sheet: Middle Class Economics: Making It Easier to Save for Retirement"}

With the finalizing of a peace agreement between Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the longest running war in the Western Hemisphere is coming to an end. We have witnessed, once again, that a sustained commitment to diplomacy and reconciliation can overcome even the most entrenched conflicts.\nThis accord is a tribute to the hard work and cooperation of countless Colombian leaders and citizens across parties and administrations who painstakingly laid the groundwork for this milestone. I especially want to commend President Juan Manuel Santos for his courageous leadership during 4 years of difficult negotiations. I, likewise, thank the Government of Cuba for hosting these talks, its coguarantor Norway, and the United States Special Envoy Bernie Aronson for his contributions to the peace process.\nEven as we mark the end of an era of war, we recognize that the work of achieving a just and lasting peace is only beginning. Yet, just as the United States has been Colombia's partner in a time of war, we will be Colombia's partner in waging peace. It is in this spirit that I stood alongside President Santos earlier this year and announced a new chapter in our relationship, Peace Colombia, which will provide a framework to reinforce security gains, reintegrate former combatants into society, and extend opportunity and the rule of law.\nFor generations, too many Colombians have known only a country ravaged by war. Many around the world have viewed Colombia only as a place of conflict. But as I saw when I visited Colombia 4 years ago, a remarkable transformation has occurred. Thanks to the strength and spirit of the Colombian people, today's Colombia is moving toward a future of optimism and hope.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118838", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nNearly one century ago, with boundless courage and relentless commitment, dedicated women who had marched, advocated, and organized for the right to cast a vote finally saw their efforts rewarded on August 26, 1920, when the 19th Amendment was certified and the right to vote was secured. In the decades that followed, that precious right has bolstered generations of women and empowered them to stand up, speak out, and steer the country they love in a more equal direction. Today, as we celebrate the anniversary of this hard-won achievement and pay tribute to the trailblazers and suffragists who moved us closer to a more just and prosperous future, we resolve to protect this constitutional right and pledge to continue fighting for equality for women and girls.\nAt every level of society, women are leaders at the forefront of progress. Serving as judges and Members of Congress, setting world records in sports, founding groundbreaking companies, and fighting on the front lines of combat, women continue to tear down barriers and shatter glass ceilings—just as they have done since the founding of our Nation. Yet such progress is not inevitable, and we must keep moving forward on our journey toward equality. In one of my first acts as President, I established the White House Council on Women and Girls to provide a coordinated response to challenges confronted by women and girls, ensuring their concerns and insights are taken into account in our policies and programs. And this year, my Administration hosted the first-ever United State of Women Summit to continue our efforts to underscore the passion, success, and ongoing commitment of advocates dedicated to advancing gender equality and realizing a brighter future for women of all ages.\nNo woman should earn less than a man for doing the same job—equal pay for equal work should be a fundamental principle of our economy and our democracy. That is why the first bill I signed into law as President was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and why I continue to call on the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. Women make up roughly half of our workforce, and we need to invest more in affordable, high-quality childcare. We must strengthen paid sick, maternity, and family leave—too many families are forced to make difficult choices between caring for a newborn and receiving a paycheck, or staying home to help a sick child or parent and keeping their job. And we must continue striving for fairness and opportunity when it comes to improving workplace policies, because we know that when women succeed, our economy and our country succeed.\nEnsuring all young women can live full and healthy lives is vital to their pursuit of personal and professional goals. Because of the Affordable Care Act, individuals can no longer be charged higher premiums simply for being a woman. But there is still more we can do to reduce discrimination when it comes to women's health—such as protecting a woman's right to choose and safeguarding access to sexual and reproductive health services, including abortion. Every person should be able to live and reach for their dreams free from fear of violence: In America, nearly one in four women has suffered physical domestic violence, a cruelty which deprives its victims of their autonomy, liberty, and security, and inhibits them from reaching their full potential. Approximately one in five women is sexually assaulted while in college. Through the It's On Us campaign and the White House Task Force to Protect Students From Sexual Assault, we have called on individuals, communities, and institutions of higher education to recognize what they can do to stop sexual assault and change our culture for the better. We have striven to support survivors and focused on making sure our schools are safe places where all students can learn, grow, and thrive. Transgender women often face escalated levels of discrimination and violence, and we have taken a number of steps to secure their civil rights, including providing guidance to educators that can help rid school environments of discrimination. The Department of Justice has also urged law enforcement agencies to address any form of gender bias that exists in responding to domestic violence and sexual assault and ensure that such bias does not undermine efforts to keep victims safe.\nUnderrepresented in management positions, underfunded as entrepreneurs, under-encouraged in STEM fields, and confronted with higher levels of unemployment, women and girls of color still face very real challenges, significant opportunity gaps, and structural barriers. That is why we have hosted forums to discuss ways to increase programming and promote opportunities for women and girls of color so they can achieve success at school, at work, and in their communities. To continue building these ladders of opportunity for women—not just in communities across our country, but also around the world—I have made advancing gender equality a foreign policy priority. My Administration has sought to end gender-based violence across the globe, promote the role of women in ending conflict and building lasting peace and security, and empower the next generation by investing in adolescent girls and breaking down barriers to get 62 million girls into schools through the Let Girls Learn initiative.\nIn the many decades since suffragists organized and mobilized, countless advocates and leaders have picked up the mantle and moved our Nation and our world forward. Today, young women in America grow up knowing an historic truth—that not only can they cast a vote, but they can also run for office and help shape the very democracy that once left them out. For these women, and for generations of women to come, we must keep building a more equal America—whether through the stories we tell about our Nation's history or the faces we display on our country's currency. On Women's Equality Day, as we recognize the accomplishments that so many women fought so hard to achieve, we rededicate ourselves to tackling the challenges that remain and expanding opportunity for women and girls everywhere.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2016, as Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to celebrate the achievements of women and promote gender equality.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA\nNOTE: This proclamation was published in the Federal Register on August 30.", "timestamp": "2016-08-25", "title": "Proclamation 9477—Women's Equality Day, 2016"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118839", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nThrough Proclamation 8031 of June 15, 2006, as amended by Proclamation 8112 of February 28, 2007, the President established the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (Monument), to protect and preserve the marine area of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and the historic and scientific objects therein. As stated in Proclamation 8031, the area, including the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Battle of Midway National Memorial, and the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, supports a dynamic reef ecosystem with more than 7,000 marine species, of which approximately one quarter are unique to the Hawaiian Islands. This diverse ecosystem is home to many species of coral, fish, birds, marine mammals, and other flora and fauna, including the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, the threatened green sea turtle, and the endangered leatherback and hawksbill sea turtles. In addition, this area has great cultural significance to the Native Hawaiian community and a connection to early Polynesian culture worthy of protection and understanding.\nAn area adjacent to the Monument, and that will constitute the Monument Expansion as set forth in this proclamation, includes the waters and submerged lands to the extent of the seaward limit of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (U.S. EEZ) west of 163° West Longitude, and extending from the boundaries depicted on the map accompanying Proclamation 8031 as amended by Proclamation 8112 (adjacent area).\nAs required by the Antiquities Act, the adjacent area contains objects of historic and scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government; they are geological and biological resources that are part of a highly pristine deep sea and open ocean ecosystem with unique biodiversity and that constitute a sacred cultural, physical, and spiritual place for the Native Hawaiian community.\nThis unique ecosystem has many significant features. Important geological features of the adjacent area include more than 75 seamounts, as well as a non-volcanic ridge that extends southwest towards the Johnston Atoll. Together, these features form biodiverse hotspots in the open ocean that provide habitat for deep-sea species, including sponges, other invertebrates, fish, and colonies of corals many thousands of years old. Recent science demonstrates that seamounts harbor a multitude of species with unique ecological traits, some newly discovered. Seamounts, ridges, and other undersea topographic features are important stepping stones that enable marine organisms to spread throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago, and between Hawaii and other archipelagoes. Undisturbed seamount communities in the adjacent area are of significant scientific interest because they provide opportunities to examine the impacts of physical, biological, and geological processes on ecosystem diversity, including understanding the impacts of climate change on these deep-sea communities. These seamounts and ridges also provide the opportunity for identification and discovery of many species not yet known to humans, with possible implications for research, medicine, and other important uses. Recent scientific research, utilizing new technology, has shown that many species identified as objects in Proclamation 8031 inhabit previously unknown geographical ranges that span beyond the existing Monument, and in some cases the adjacent area also provides important foraging habitat for these species. For example, the endangered Hawaiian monk seal forages well beyond the existing Monument. Scientific research on Hawaiian monk seal foraging behavior has shown that monk seals may travel 80 miles and dive to depths of almost 2,000 feet while feeding.\nImportant bird species abound in the Monument and the adjacent area. Birds from the world's largest colonies of Laysan albatross, Black-footed albatross, and Bonin petrels, as well as significant populations of shearwaters, petrels, tropicbirds, the endangered Short-tailed albatross, and other seabird species forage in the adjacent area. We now know that albatrosses and Great Frigatebirds rely on the adjacent area during chick-brooding periods, when their foraging is focused within 200 miles of the nesting colonies on the Monument's islands and atolls. At other times, these wide-ranging species use a much broader range (over 1,600 miles) for foraging.\nThe adjacent area is a foraging and migration path for five species of protected sea turtles. While green and hawksbill turtles use the near-shore waters of the Monument for nesting, these species—along with the endangered leatherback turtle and threatened loggerhead and olive ridley turtles—migrate through the adjacent area to reach high-productivity foraging areas.\nTwenty-four species of whales and dolphins have been sighted in the adjacent area. Three of these species are listed under the Endangered Species Act as threatened or endangered: sperm whales, fin whales, and sei whales. Cetacean use of the Monument Expansion varies; resident species such as spinner dolphins, false killer whales, and rough-toothed dolphins utilize the area year-round, whereas other species, such as humpback whales, use it as a wintering area. A wide variety of tropical and temperate water dolphin species inhabit the Monument Expansion, including pantropical spotted dolphins, spinner dolphins, striped dolphins, rough-toothed dolphins, and bottlenose dolphins. Several rarely sighted species of dolphin inhabit the area, including Risso's and Fraser's dolphins. Both of these species are primarily oceanic and found in waters deeper than 1,000 meters. Acoustic evidence also shows that endangered blue whales—the largest animals on Earth—visit the area and may migrate past the Hawaiian Islands twice a year.\nSharks, including tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks, are key species in the ecosystems of the Monument and adjacent area. These large and highly mobile predators have expansive home ranges and regularly move across the boundaries of the current Monument into the adjacent waters. Additionally, blue sharks, three species of thresher sharks, and two species of mako sharks inhabit the open ocean environment of the adjacent area.\nThe Monument and adjacent area are part of the most remote island archipelago on Earth. This biological and geographic isolation, coupled with unique oceanographic and geological conditions, has resulted in an ecosystem critical for new species formation and endemism. These forces result in some of the most unique and diverse ecological communities on the planet.\nImportance to Native Hawaiian Culture\nThe ocean will always be seen as an integral part of cultural identity for the Native Hawaiian community. The deep sea, the ocean surface, the sky, and all the living things in the area adjacent to the Monument are important to this culture and are deeply rooted in creation and settlement stories. Native Hawaiian culture considers the Monument and the adjacent area a sacred place. This place contains the boundary between Ao, the world of light and the living, and Pō the world of the gods and spirits from which all life is born and to which ancestors return after death. Long-distance voyaging and wayfinding is one of the most unique and valuable traditional practices that the Native Hawaiian community has developed and continues to advance. Once on the verge of cultural extinction, new double-hulled sailing canoes, beginning with the Hōkūle'a in the 1970s, are bringing voyaging and wayfinding to new generations. This traditional practice relies on celestial, biological, and natural signs, such as winds, waves, currents and the presence of birds and marine life. The open ocean ecosystem and its natural resources in the adjacent area play an important role within the cultural voyaging seascape within the Hawaiian Archipelago.\nShipwrecks\nWorld War II shipwrecks and aircraft in the adjacent area, though not identified as objects under the Antiquities Act in this proclamation, are of great historic interest. The naval portion of the Battle of Midway, one of the most important naval battles of World War II, occurred approximately 200 miles to the northeast of Midway Atoll, in the adjacent area. Deep-sea technologies have enabled the USS Yorktown, an aircraft carrier torpedoed during the battle, to be found at more than 16,000 feet below the ocean's surface. Eyewitness accounts and historical records tell the stories of the destroyer USS Hammann, five Japanese vessels (the four aircraft carriers Hiryu, Soryu, Kaga, and Akagi, and the cruiser Mikuma), and several hundred aircraft that were also lost during the battle in this area. The locations of these vessels have yet to be identified. All told, the adjacent area serves as a final resting place for the more than 3,000 people lost during the battle.\nWhereas, the waters and submerged lands adjacent to the Monument (west of 163° West Longitude and seaward from the boundaries delineated in Proclamation 8031 as amended by Proclamation 8112 out to the limit of the U.S. EEZ) contain objects of historic and scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government;\nWhereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;\nWhereas, it is in the public interest to preserve the marine environment, including the waters and submerged lands in the U.S. EEZ west of 163° West Longitude adjacent to Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument for the care and management of the historic and scientific objects therein;\nWhereas, the well-being of the United States, the prosperity of its citizens and the protection of the ocean environment are complementary and reinforcing priorities; and the United States continues to act with due regard for the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea enjoyed by other nations under the law of the sea in managing the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument and adjacent areas, and does not compromise the readiness, training, and global mobility of the U.S. Armed Forces when establishing marine protected areas;\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be part of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument Expansion (Monument Expansion) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as a part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map entitled \"Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument Expansion\" attached hereto, which forms a part of this proclamation. The Monument Expansion comprises the waters and submerged lands in the U.S. EEZ west of 163° West Longitude adjacent to the Monument. The Federal lands and interests in lands reserved consist of approximately 442,781 square miles, which is the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\nAll Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the Monument Expansion are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, leasing, or other disposition under the public land laws to the extent that those laws apply, including but not limited to, withdrawal from location, entry, and patent under mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to development of oil and gas, minerals, geothermal, or renewable energy. Lands and interest in lands within the Monument Expansion not owned or controlled by the United States shall be reserved as part of the Monument Expansion upon acquisition of title or control by the United States.\nManagement of the Marine National Monument\nNothing in this proclamation shall change the management of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument or any of the provisions specified in Proclamations 8031 and 8112. Terms used in this proclamation shall have the same meaning as those defined in Proclamation 8031. The Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior (Secretaries) shall share management responsibility for the Monument Expansion. The Secretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall have responsibility for management of activities and species within the Monument Expansion under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Endangered Species Act (for species regulated by NOAA), the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and any other applicable Department of Commerce legal authorities. The Secretary of the Interior, through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall have responsibility for management of activities and species within the Monument Expansion under its applicable legal authorities, including the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, the Refuge Recreation Act, and the Endangered Species Act (for species regulated by FWS), and Public Law 98-532 and Executive Order 6166 of June 10, 1933.\nAdditionally, the Secretary of Commerce should consider initiating the process under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.) to designate the Monument Expansion area and the Monument seaward of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and Battle of Midway National Memorial as a National Marine Sanctuary to supplement and complement existing authorities.\nThe Secretaries shall prepare a joint management plan, within their respective authorities and after consultation with the State of Hawaii, for the Monument Expansion within 3 years of the date of this proclamation, and shall promulgate as appropriate implementing regulations,\nwithin their respective authorities, that address any further specific actions necessary for the proper care and management of the objects and areas identified in this proclamation. The Secretaries shall revise and update the management plan as necessary. In developing and implementing any management plans and any management rules and regulations, the Secretaries shall consult, designate, and involve as cooperating agencies the agencies with jurisdiction or special expertise, including the Department of Defense and Department of State, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and its implementing regulations. If the Secretaries deem it beneficial, they may prepare a joint management plan for the entire Monument and Monument Expansion area, consistent with the provisions of the respective proclamations.\nThe Secretaries shall coordinate and work cooperatively with the Department of Defense, through the United States Navy, to protect, under the Sunken Military Craft Act, Public Law 108-375, 118 Stat. 1811, and any other applicable legal authorities, United States sunken military vessels and aircraft that are found within the geographic boundaries of the Monument Expansion. Any sunken craft of a foreign state found within the geographic boundaries of the Monument Expansion may be protected to the extent authorized under U.S. law, consistent with the President's Statement on United States Policy for the Protection of Sunken Warships (January 19, 2001).\nThis proclamation shall be applied in accordance with international law. The management plans and their implementing regulations shall impose no unlawful restrictions on innocent passage or otherwise unlawfully restrict navigation and overflight and other internationally recognized lawful uses of the sea in the Monument and Monument Expansion and shall incorporate the provisions of this proclamation regarding U.S. Armed Forces actions and compliance with international law. No restrictions shall apply to or be enforced against a person who is not a citizen, national, or resident alien of the United States (including foreign flag vessels) unless in accordance with international law. Also, in accordance with international law, no restrictions shall apply to foreign warships, naval auxiliaries, and other vessels owned or operated by a state and used, for the time being, only on Government non-commercial service, in order to fully respect the sovereign immunity of such vessels under international law. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior, shall take steps to protect the Monument Expansion as it does with respect to the Monument as specified in Proclamation 8031.\nRestrictions\nProhibited Activities\nThe Secretaries shall prohibit persons from conducting or causing to be conducted the following activities:\n1. Exploring for, developing, or producing oil, gas, or minerals, or any energy development activities within the Monument Expansion;\n2. Using or attempting to use poisons, electrical charges, or explosives in the collection or harvest of a Monument Expansion resource;\n3.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118909", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n11:52 A.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Morning, everybody. Happy Friday. Before we get started I'll just do a -- one piece of news you may have seen already. As part of the President's commitment to protect the natural beauty of the United States, we announced today that President Obama is building on this leadership by taking an historic step in creating the world's largest marine protected area just off the coast of Hawaii.\nThe designation will more than quadruple the size of the existing marine monument, permanently protecting pristine coral reefs, deep-sea marine habitats, and other important ecological features and resources in the waters of the northwest Hawaiian Islands. Altogether, President Obama has protected more public lands and waters than any other President, and has protected important marine coastal environments, spectacular natural areas renowned for their outdoor recreation opportunities they offer.\nAnd these sights often help tell the story of significant people or extraordinary events in American history. In fact, studies have shown that every dollar we invest in our national parks generates $10 for the national economy, most of which stays in local communities. And our national parks, forests and other public lands attract visitors from all over the world, fueling local economies and supporting an estimated $646 billion-dollar national outdoor economy.\nSo I'm happy to take your questions on the Papahanaumokuakea National Marine Monument -- (applause) -- or anything else that may be on your mind today.\nQ: Thanks, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: There's been a little practicing this morning.\nQ: Let's start with the economy. I wanted to ask you about this newest estimate showing that the economy was growing at a 1.1-percent rate in the spring, a little bit of a revision downward. Is that concerning to the White House or not, particularly given the assessment from Chairwoman Yellen that the economy looks like it's strong enough that the case is building for an interest rate hike?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the revision was just down one-tenth of 1 percent, so I don't think that there is a whole lot of new information that's revealed in the revision, some greater specificity around some of the underlying metrics.\nBut, look, even in those underlying metrics, there is some optimistic data to take a look at. I think the most significant of those is that consumer spending grew at a very strong rate of 4.4 percent in the second quarter. And I think that is consistent with the strong readings of consumer sentiment that we see in the economy. I think that is an indication that the President's optimism about the economy is shared pretty broadly by the American people.\nNow, I think everybody agrees that there's a lot more important work that needs to get done. And the President certainly has spent some time talking about additional steps he believes the country needs to take to ensure that economic opportunity is being enjoyed by people up and down the income scale. And that's why the President has made expanding access to a college education such a high priority. The President continues to believe that a robust investment in infrastructure, particularly while interest rates are low, would have positive economic benefits for the country in the short term, but would also lay a foundation for our long-term economic strength.\nSo the President has got plenty of ideas about what additional work could be done to strengthen the economy and to further strengthen economic growth. But the President's optimism about the U.S. economy is widely shared, and it should be.\nAs it relates to comments from the Fed Chair, I understand that she gave a speech a little earlier this morning, and I'll let her assessment of the economy speak for itself.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. There's been this debate taking place in France over the burkini, which although it's a different legal system over there, it seems to mirror the debate that we've been having in this country about religious freedom and tolerance, and concerns expressed over the political sphere about Islam. If a U.S. municipality were to ban the use of the burkini the way a number have in France, what kind of a view of that would the White House take?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, I want to be careful of not weighing in too aggressively to second-guess the policy decisions that are being made by one of our closest allies, particularly when it comes to their assessment about national security and homeland security.\nI think what I can say affirmatively about the United States and certainly the approach that the President has taken is there's a reason that the United States is a beacon of freedom around the world. The United States of America was founded to serve as a country where people could observe their religious faith and worship God without the fear of persecution or even intrusion by government authorities. This freedom of religion is something that we hold dear in this country. And what's important about the right to a freedom of religion is that every American citizen enjoys it.\nEvery American citizen, regardless of your faith, benefits from the protection that's provided by the United States Constitution. The President certainly believes strongly in protecting freedom of religion, and believes that it's important that the commitment to that value and the commitment to that principle is reflected in the kinds of policies that are advanced by the federal government. The President also happens to believe that the commitment to those values actually strengthens our national security.\nQ: And lastly, we didn't have a chance to talk a lot about the Olympics while the President was on Martha's Vineyard. But Ryan Lochte is now being charged with filing basically a false police report in Brazil, and I'm wondering, given the fact that we have an extradition treaty with Brazil, would the U.S. consider a request from Brazil to extradite one of our own citizens?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the United States will certainly adhere to the terms of any extradition treaty that we've signed with any country in the world. Obviously, as we've discussed in a very different context, we remain committed to following those guidelines assiduously, and allowing the guidelines of those treaties and the law here in the United States to guide those discussions and to guide those decisions.\nI can't speak to the details of the charges that have been reportedly filed against Mr. Lochte, so for more details on that I think I'd refer you either to Brazilian authorities or to attorneys that have been retained by Mr. Lochte.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thanks. There have been reports of Yemeni missiles hitting Saudi Arabia's oil facilities today. I was wondering -- and oil prices are up on these reports. Is the White House monitoring this? Is there concern about this latest seeming attack?\nMR. EARNEST: Ayesha, I have not seen this specific report. What I can tell you in general is that the United States has expressed on a number of occasions our concern about potential instability along Saudi Arabia's southern border. I think the only people who are more concerned about that are the Saudis themselves. And they have expressed their own concerns about how some of the chaos and violence that they've seen in Yemen could spill over into Saudi Arabia. And Saudi Arabia has undertaken military actions that they say are necessary to try to limit that threat. And the United States has provided some limited support to those operations. We certainly do stand shoulder to shoulder with our partners in Saudi Arabia as they figure out the most effective way to limit the national security risk that they face from the chaos and violence in the country along their southern border.\nQ: Moving on to Iran, so a U.S. Navy ship fired warning shots to warn an Iranian fast-attack craft yesterday. And this is the latest in a series of incidents in the Gulf this week. I was wondering, what does the White House think about these incidents that they seem to be escalating? Does the White House consider that these tactics are planned or that this is an orchestrated -- that these events are being orchestrated towards some end? What is the White House view on these incidents?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, Ayesha, you won't be surprised to hear that the White House is well aware of recent incidents in and around the Strait of Hormuz of Iranian vessels approaching U.S. vessels who are operating in international waters. The Department of Defense has reached their own assessment about a couple of these situations and determined that the actions that were taken by the Iranian vessels were unsafe and unprofessional.\nIt's unclear exactly what their intentions were or what their aims might have been, but the behavior that we have seen is not acceptable, primarily because this is already a volatile region of the world. And in a compressed space like the Strait of Hormuz, it only increases the risk associated with possible miscalculations. That's certainly something that we want to avoid. And the truth is, a more dangerous interaction was avoided because of the professionalism and skill of our United States Navy and our men and women who represent our country in the United States Navy.\nSo obviously the situation is rather unique, and our ability to discern exactly what their intent was is limited by the fact that we don't have diplomatic relations with Iran. There are some channels where we've engaged in some talks, but there are no formal diplomatic representation of the United States on Iranian soil. That typically -- where we've had these kinds of concerns have been raised by, for example, Russian military vessels, we've got diplomatic channels that we can use to express our concerns and to try to reach an understanding about what exactly happened, we're a little limited in our ability to do so because of the limited diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran.\nQ: But is there a concern that these incidents are escalating? Is there maybe a call now to maybe to change tactics on the U.S. behalf or to do something about these incidents that keep occurring?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, just to make sure that the record is clear here, these are U.S. vessels who are operating professionally in international waters, consistent with international norms. And it's only because of their professionalism that a more significant incident was avoided. And the behavior and the actions that we've seen by these Iranian vessels is a source of concern because their actions were unsafe and unprofessional, and because in territory that's as compressed -- or in international waters that are as compressed as the Strait of Hormuz, the likelihood of miscalculation is increased. And that is certainly something that we want to avoid.\nMichelle.\nQ: We've heard plenty of speeches this week from each presidential candidate, especially just yesterday -- hearing from both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, pretty much back to back. And what you see is the nominee on each side basically calling the other a bigot. You've talked about the debate in this country and how that's good for America. Do you still feel like the debate is good for this country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President himself has acknowledged that there are certain aspects of our political discourse [that] have gotten too polarized in a way that, ultimately, is counterproductive and only does feed greater dysfunction in our political system. And the President has acknowledged that his own performance on this measure is not perfect, but it's been quite good.\nI would say I think that there is a risk of drawing an equivalence, even among the two presidential candidates, that I don't think would withstand any scrutiny at all by an unbiased analyst. And I think that people will consider the rhetoric and language that is used by the presidential candidates to draw their own conclusions about that individual's fitness for office. But I think that's part of the case that people make about what presidential elections are all about.\nWhile running -- being a presidential candidate is very different than being President of the United States. When you're a presidential candidate, you do face some of the same challenges and stressors that a President has to face in difficult times. Being in the spotlight, being asked difficult questions under pressure, being able to communicate clearly to the country something that you believe, even if the topic is something that's quite complicated.\nSo I think it's entirely fair for people to listen carefully and to listen closely to the individual candidates, and to draw some conclusions about the rhetoric that they use.\nQ: I mean, there's been a lot of name-calling. And obviously that's something that's been there before in American politics. I mean, you look 100-odd years ago, there was some pretty nasty and rough things said on the trail. But there's something about this cycle that has shocked many watchers. Does the administration feel like this cycle has changed American politics for good?\nMR. EARNEST: When you say \"for good,\" you mean for the better, or you mean permanently?\nQ: Or you could just say, has it changed American politics?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think many people have made the observation that the political debate in this country, in this cycle, is markedly different than the kind of race that has been run in recent presidential cycles. And some of that is due to the rhetoric that we've seen on the Republican side of the aisle. There's just no denying that. And not by any one candidate. There were a variety of Republican candidates earlier in the primary process that had some quite shocking, controversial, and even offensive things to say -- some of them about the President of the United States.\nSo that being said, I think the President has got a lot of confidence in the wisdom of the American people and in the strength of this country's democratic institutions -- and I'm referring to our system of government as a democracy, and not of the Democratic Party -- but the confidence in our institutions to withstand some additional stress. But I would acknowledge that the American people and their ears and our institutions are facing a little more stress than they have in years past.\nQ: The reason I ask is because we often hear -- and you just said yesterday -- that the debate is good for America, this is a debate we should be having. But the way the debate has been conducted -- maybe you could say on both sides -- through this cycle, has that been good for America, really?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think there is a grave danger in drawing an equivalence between the rhetoric that we provide by both sides. But what I will say is I think that there is no denying that some of the rhetoric that we have heard from presidential candidates has been counterproductive and has been inconsistent with our country's values. And the President is not pleased to see that. That said, the President understands, and has made the case himself on many occasions, that running for President is tough business, and there is throughout American history -- there are throughout American history any number of examples of harsh rhetoric on the campaign trail. And it's not the first time that we've seen that in the context of American politics. But I think it is fair to say that there seems to be a little something different going on this time around.\nJon, nice to see you.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about an interview that the parents of Kayla Mueller did. Of course, Kayla Mueller was taken hostage and murdered by ISIS, and the President went out to visit with the family about 17 months ago. Her parents say that, during that visit, the President had promised to make a donation to a foundation they had set up in Kayla's name. Is that correct? Did he make that promise?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jon, let me just start by saying that obviously the ordeal that the Mueller family has had to endure is unimaginable. And their daughter, Kayla Mueller, was a special person who had a special calling in her life. And I actually still remember the first time that we were in this room talking about reports of her death. And her parents made public a letter that she had written and been able to deliver to them, or have delivered to them, where she talked about how her life had been fulfilled based on her passion to serve people in need. And I think the line that she used was she said that she recalled seeing God in the eyes of people who were in crisis. It's a really profound statement for somebody who was -- she was just in her late twenties when she was killed.\nAnd her life and her example I think has had an impact on people all across the country. Her life and her example have had an impact on people here at the White House, myself included. And given all that, I think the pain and grief that continues to be experienced to this day by Kayla's parents I think is entirely understandable.\nWhat I can say -- I'm not going to speak to any private conversations that the President has had with the Mueller family. I know that they've given an interview. What I will say is the President is aware of the foundation, Kayla's Hands, that's been formed to honor her memory and to honor her life's work. Is certainly is consistent with the kind of charitable organization that the President and the First Lady have supported in the past. And I do anticipate that the President would make a commitment to support this organization moving forward.\nQ: What Carl Mueller, Kayla's father, said is that the President in that meeting, back in March of last year -- that he said that he would be making a donation to the foundation, and 17 months later he says the donation has not been made. Can you confirm that no donation has been made?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I wasn't a part of the conversation. Obviously, Mr. Mueller and the President were. So what I can tell you is --\nQ: But you wouldn't think he would lie about this?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not accusing anybody of not telling the truth. I'm just indicating that I wasn't part of the meeting. And even if I were, I wouldn't -- this is a private conversation. The President obviously is aware of the foundation that's been set up to support the life's work of Kayla Mueller, and it is exactly the kind of organization that the President and First Lady have supported in the past, and I would anticipate that this is a foundation that the President and First Lady would support.\nQ: Can you think of any reason that would prompt a delay like that? I mean, I know the President is obviously busy. Could he have forgotten about it? Or is there something that would prevent him as President for making a donation?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I can't speak to any promises or conversations between the President and the Mueller family directly.\nQ: The Mueller family, both parents, also expressed some disappointment with the amounts -- or saying that the efforts that were taken to free Kayla before she was murdered were inadequate. What Carl Mueller says is the President could have been a hero, but he chose not to. What's your reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, this is a father who is grieving over the loss of his daughter. And again, I think the grief and sadness that he feels about the fact that his daughter was not successfully rescued I think is an entirely human response and one that's entirely understandable. What I will say, Jon, is that at the direction of President Obama himself, a variety of national security agencies in the federal government expend significant resources and dedicate significant time to going to great lengths to try to rescue Americans who are being unjustly held against their will around the world.\nAnd you'll also recall, Jon -- I know you covered this closely -- there were some weaknesses in that approach that were identified by the administration. And there have been important reforms that have been made to that process over the course of the last 18 to 24 months that have resulted in more effective use of those resources and more effective use of the expertise within the federal government to sharpen our efforts to secure the return, or to rescue American citizens held against their will around the world.\nThere also has been a concerted effort made to improve the way in which the federal government of the United States communicates with families who are in this unspeakable situation, like the Mueller family was. And the President has been pleased by the way those reforms have improved the effectiveness, both in terms of securing the release of American hostages, but also in terms of communicating more clearly and directly with families who are in that difficult situation.\nBut the President hopes that the pace of improvement will continue as the reforms take root.\nQ: And I remember one of those issues was the question of private individuals paying ransom. The Muellers say that White House officials threatened them with criminal prosecution if they tried to pay the $6 million ransom that ISIS was demanding. Is that correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as we've talked about before, there are sort of three aspects to this. The first is, I'm just not going to get into private conversations between government officials and families who are in this difficult situation. I can tell you that it is not the policy of the Obama administration to threaten families like these who are in this situation with prosecution.\nBut thirdly, the United States does have a policy that we have assiduously followed of not paying ransom. And that is a very painful policy, and it's understandable that families like the Muellers would have grave concerns about that policy, both as a policy matter, and I can understand them raising some pretty thorny moral questions about that, too. But the conclusion that President Obama reached is the same conclusion that previous Presidents in both parties have reached, which is that to get in the habit of paying ransom would only make Americans traveling overseas a more appetizing target to criminal or terrorist organizations that are hoping to collect a ransom.\nAnd so for that reason, we've made clear and we have carefully followed a policy of not paying ransom, even to secure the release of Americans who are being held against their will overseas.\nQ: Okay, and just a last question, Josh. So just to be clear, the first line of questioning here. Can the Mueller family expect that the President, that the Obamas will make a donation to their daughter's -- to the foundation in the name of Kayla Mueller soon?\nMR. EARNEST: As I mentioned, I can't speak to any previous conversations that they've had, but I can tell you that --\nQ: But is a donation coming, is the question.\nMR. EARNEST: The foundation, Kayla's Hands, that's been established in her memory is certainly the kind of foundation that the President and First Lady have supported in the past. And I would anticipate that they would make a financial contribution to continue supporting it.\nJustin.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about the coordination deal that Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov were discussing today. I'm just wondering if you can give us any update on how those conversations are going, and also if you can confirm the kind of coordination between Russia and the U.S. on airstrikes as part of that deal, being the de-confliction that we've talked about previously.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly know that Russia has expressed some interest in greater military cooperation. The concern that we have expressed is that too much of the time and attention of the Russian military is being devoted to propping up the Assad regime and, in some cases, aiding and abetting the horrific tactics of the Assad regime. We know that government military assets, including aircraft, with the full support of the Russians and the Iranians, have been used to target civilians and to target medical facilities. It's beyond the pale.\nSo as a practical matter, the actions that we've seen from the Assad regime are indefensible from a moral perspective. But for people who aren't interested in morality, even as a practical matter, they only put off the kind of solution that even the Russians themselves acknowledge is necessary to deal with the situation inside of Syria.\nAs long as Russia is willing to support the Assad regime's murderous military tactics that often claims the lives of innocent women and children, the more difficult it is for a political solution to be reached. It's also more difficult for humanitarian relief to be delivered to these communities that so badly need it.\nSo that's the crux of the problem here. And I recognize that it is a problem for the United States and that it has prevented the kind of political progress that we'd like to see inside of Syria. But it's an even bigger problem for the Russians, primarily because it calls into question their integrity and their effectiveness to deal with the puppet regime that they're maintaining in Syria. But it also raises questions because there's an internal contradiction in their strategy that they have failed to resolve. They say that a political transition is necessary, but yet they are deeply invested in propping up the Assad regime. And the more they prop up the Assad regime, the more difficult it is to effect a political transition.\nSo I recognize that this has been an impediment to the United States making progress in the direction that we would like to see, which is an end to the violence inside of Syria, trying to get the chaos under control and thereby make it more difficult for extremist organizations to operate there. But because of the Russians and because of their inability or their refusal to exercise some influence over the Assad regime, it's only continued to fuel the kind of extremism that the Russians I think are rightly worried about.\nSo this is all the subject of ongoing discussion between Secretary Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov. I don't have a detailed update on those conversations to share with you, primarily because, at least as I learned shortly before we walked out here, they're still talking. But we've been clear about what it is we need to see, and what we need to see is we need to see a clear commitment demonstrated in real life on the ground that the Russians and the Syrian government are willing to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities over six months ago now.\nQ: I guess I'm trying to understand how to read that wind-up -- whether it was just sort of a history of the conflict in Syria, or if it was an indication that you -- that the talks are going in a direction where you don't think that the Russians and the Assad regime are making the type of concessions that you would need to see for this type of military agreement.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I probably don't speak the kind of blunt diplomatic -- let me say it this way. I probably don't speak the kind of nuanced diplomatic talk that may be valued in other agencies. But we've been pretty clear about this and we're not seeking concessions -- we're seeking the Russian government living up to the commitments that they've made. They've made commitments in the context of the cessation of hostilities. They made those commitments six months ago.\nAnd for several weeks, there was a lot of skepticism when they initially made those commitments about their willingness or their ability to follow through on them. And I think everyone was pleasantly surprised. There did seem to be a commitment on the part of the Russians, both in terms of their own activities and both in terms of using their influence with the Assad regime, to scale back military activities in a way that allowed for much improved, though not perfect, humanitarian access and created space for diplomatic and political negotiations.\nBut over the last several months, we've seen the commitment to the cessation of hostilities fray in far too many communities, particularly around Aleppo. And that has led to a situation where the humanitarian situation that was already terrible has somehow gotten even worse. The political talks are struggling, if they're doing anything, and the Russian activities only fuel extremism in that country.\nNow, because of the efforts of the United States and our counter-ISIL coalition, we've been able to address a lot of that, and ISIL is under a lot of pressure in Syria. And we've made important progress on the ground against ISIL in Syria. But that's come in spite of the actions of the Russians who continue to engage in activities that only fuel extremism.\nSo it's a complicated situation right now, I would acknowledge that. And, again, there are negative consequences for the United States because of the inability of the Russians to live up to their commitments. But the negative consequences for the Russians themselves are much greater and it's appealing to that self-interest.\nSo that's why -- I guess that's a long answer to your question. The point is, that's why I'd make the case to you that we're not describing these as concessions on the part of the Russians. This is about living up to commitments that they made that are entirely consistent with their own self-interest. And, unfortunately, for reasons I think that only the Russians themselves can explain, they've refused to do that.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on your answer to Josh about GDP. The consumer-spending statistic that you cited was driven somewhat by used car sales, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but we've also seen proliferation of car loans being given to people with bad credit that are designed in a way with high interest rates, that are almost created -- there's an economy sort of designed for defaults and making money off of that. Is there concern that this kind of consumer spending and that the used car sector in particular is a bubble that could burst in the way that we saw with the housing sector?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think more generally -- I can't speak to the specifics of the used car sector. We certainly can find somebody in the President's Council of Economic Advisers to follow up with you on this, so we'll have somebody do that.\nI think what the data does show is that the credit health of the U.S. economy, particularly when you're talking about individuals, as opposed to businesses, has improved quite significantly over the last seven or eight years. That the credit bubble that we saw in the run-up to the financial crisis in 2008, 2009 is in a much-improved situation. And there are a variety of reasons for that, and some of it is the important work that's been done as a part of Wall Street reform. Some of that is a function of common sense -- people learning some important, even painful lessons.\nSo there has been improvement on this scale. When it comes to emerging risks, including things like the used car market, I'm going to defer to the experts who may be able to give you a better answer on that.\nQ: One last one. The DHS announced today its proposal to sort of unilaterally create a new type of entrepreneurship visa. My question, though, is: A lot of refugee advocates have talked about asking governments to create new visas that would sort of temporarily allow more quickly refugees to enter both the United States and other countries. So I'm wondering if DHS, since it's right now in the business of creating different visas, if that's an idea that's been considered or worked on, or a proposal that the U.S. would advocate for other countries, if not the U.S. specifically.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'd refer you to my colleagues at DHS in terms of the specifics of answering the question about whether or not a specific refugee-like visa could be issued. I know that there have been steps to try to address the refugee situation with regard to Central America, and this is something that administration officials have been discussing with their counterparts in Costa Rica. And they've established a process that allows for individuals to apply for refugee status without coming to the United States.\nAnd that could stem the tide -- the flow of individuals from Central America to the southwest border of the United States, and help us get a handle on that particular situation while continuing to enforce our laws and make sure that we live up to the standards set by the President to subject potential refugees to more thorough vetting and screening than any other individual who enters the United States. And the President continues to be committed to that principle.\nBut in terms of potential use of some visa -- or some executive action that could involve some visa-like authority, I'd refer you to DHS on that.\nRon.\nQ: A couple quick Syria questions. The idea of safe zones has been often -- is that still off the table in the President's view?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah.\nQ: It's just something that's -- not something militarily that's in America's interest?\nMR. EARNEST: That is still off the table because of the implied military commitment that it would require in order to effectively enforce it. The concern is that while it sounds simple to maintain that kind of area, ultimately you're responsible for protecting the borders of that safe zone and then policing that safe zone once it's been created. That would be work-intensive, to say the least. It would be dangerous. It would likely require a greater U.S. military commitment. And all of that would come at the expense of our ongoing efforts to focus on degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.\nQ: There's been a military analysis done of the possibility of doing this or not.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know how formal of an analysis there's been. But there certainly has been -- well, I guess I could say this. There's been a consideration and a discussion of this issue, and at each time it's discussed, the team comes back to the realization that this work-intensive, dangerous effort to establish borders, to patrol the skies overhead, and to police the area once it's been created is all too likely to fall on the shoulders of the United States of America in a way that's contrary to our interests and in a way that could be contrary to our ongoing counter-ISIL efforts.\nQ: Do you know if there's been a determination of whether it's thought that President Assad is guilty of crimes against humanity, war crimes, for all the horrible things he's done?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we read a little bit more about them today. There's a quite painful story in the New York Times today about the situation in Daraya that, essentially, the scorched-earth strategy that has been executed -- and I use that word appropriately -- by the Assad regime to target medical facilities and to target residential facilities housing women and children is unconscionable.\nQ: Is he guilty of crimes against humanity?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are international institutions that have been established to fairly evaluate questions like that. And these international institutions collect evidence, and they have a process for conducting those kinds of investigations and reaching those kinds of judgments. The United States is strongly supportive of, and has even called for, international consideration of this exact question. Unfortunately, at the United Nations we've seen countries like Russia and China step forward to try to block progress of those investigations. And that's deeply disappointing, particularly when you read the kinds of accounts that I read about today in the New York Times.\nQ: So there is a process of delay where the United States is trying to -- I don't know how to characterize it. Is there a process of delay where the United States is trying to get the international community to reach that conclusion?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what the United States has done is called for the international community and the International Criminal Court and other organizations to conduct investigations and get to the bottom of this specific question, to conduct an investigation that is impartial and is genuinely independent. We're strongly supportive of that. And I know that this question has been raised at the United Nations level and it's been blocked by the Russians and the Chinese, and that's, again, unfortunate when there's a lot of evidence to indicate that the Assad regime is engaged in tactics like targeting women and children and targeting medical facilities that are just unconscionable and entirely inconsistent with the law of armed conflict.\nAnd the United States believes strongly that people should be held accountable and that they ultimately will. But that accountability should come through the well-established international process and through the international bodies that are charged with conducting these kinds of investigations and reaching those kinds of conclusions.\nQ: There was a big transition meeting here the other day that the Chief of Staff shared.\nMR. EARNEST: Just yesterday.\nQ: Can you give us anything about what happened, what was on the agenda, what they're talking about at this stage of the game?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, as you know, the President made a smooth transition a top priority for his team this year. And we've talked a lot about how effective President Bush's team was in their last year in the White House, preparing in advance for a smooth transition. And President Obama and his team here at the White House benefitted from that tremendously, and I think it did reflect a commitment to professionalism and democracy that President Obama and his team is determined to live up to.\nAnd that's why, over the course of this year, you have seen a steady pace of preparations already underway for a transition that's not going to take place for another five months or so. The conversation yesterday, I understand, involved some senior members of the Trump campaign, some senior representatives from the Clinton-Kaine transition project. There were a number of senior White House officials involved, including a couple of senior national security officials.\nAnd I can tell you that this meeting of the White House Transition Coordinating Council was focused on the kinds of steps along the way that the federal government and that the representatives of the two candidates will have to take over the course of the next five months as they eventually prepare for one of them to become President of the United States.\nQ: I'm just struck that there were so many very high-ranking administration officials in the room. Any more detail about what a meeting at this point -- what's on the agenda? Are you looking at national security issues around the world? Are you looking at logistics of the buildings, the rooms? I have no --\nMR. EARNEST: I think mostly this is not a focus on policy issues, this is more a focus on the administrative process of bringing people onboard and eventually preparing them to assume significant responsibilities in the federal government. So there's a discussion about different government agencies, about what the structure of those agencies looks like, and what process needs to be undertaken to prepare people to assume responsibility at those agencies inside those structures.\nQ: And lastly, given the tone of the campaign and given the President's strong feelings about this election, it is still your position that you are being -- that the administration is being even-handed in its dealings in these types of transitions?\nMR. EARNEST: Absolutely. The President and his team are determined to being even-handed in planning for a presidential transition. That's what the American people would expect of their President.\nAnd again, this is one of the reasons that what President Bush's team here at the White House did -- they prepared for a transition in an even-handed way, and was able to even work effectively with a Democratic -- incoming Democratic administration that was predicated on bringing change to Washington, and changing many of the policies that President Bush had advocated. But yet his team's commitment to democracy was strong enough to ensure a smooth transition. They set a very high standard, and President Obama is determined to not just meet but to even exceed that standard.\nAnd that's why we started our planning so early in the year. That's why you see this steady pace of meetings. And thus far it's going well, but there's a lot of important work to do between now and January 20th.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I know we talked a bit about the EpiPen controversy yesterday, and I know it's difficult to sort of drill down on a company in particular, but I wanted to sort of revisit it for just a second. Yahoo! reports that the CEO of Mylan -- that's the company that is marketing the pen at more than $600-per -- said on an earnings call earlier this month that she was blaming the administration and, in particular, blaming Obamacare, saying that employers' increased use of high deductible plans -- one of the side effects of the law -- has resulted in patients paying more out of pocket for the drug. What's your reaction to critics who charge that it was the Obamacare changes that somehow exacerbated this extraordinary increase in cost for the EpiPen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess that flies in the face of a logical explanation, which is that based on the news reports that I've seen, the company made a specific decision to jack up the price.\nSo I wasn't on the call and I haven't seen the reports of the call, so it's hard for me to comment directly on those comments. But your media outlet is among many who has chronicled the precipitous increase in the price of this specific device, and that certainly raised a lot of questions. But I think it is hard to try to deflect the blame for the increase in price to anything else, including Obamacare.\nQ: Let me ask you about Gitmo. Any chance to announce any more transfers in the days ahead? And I ask because I know that the number -- I believe it's at 61 now -- could drop somewhere even in the 20s between now and the end of the administration. I know that there have been some conversations to empty it out completely. That may or may not happen. Anything coming in the days ahead?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have anything to announce in advance of a potential transfer. But if there are any transfers that are made we certainly will follow the practice that we have maintained for quite some time now in terms of making public the names of the individuals who have been transferred, and disclosing exactly where they've been transferred, at least in terms of other countries, and announcing that shortly after that transfer has been completed.\nQ: Has the government paid these other countries a particular fee for a detainee that they're willing to take on? Is that how the process works, at least in part?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the process works by the United States working effectively with our partners around the world, and there are a wide variety of countries that have worked with us to ensure the safe and successful transfer of these individuals. There are extensive diplomatic negotiations involved, and in just about every case there is an intensive discussion about what sort of security precautions are imposed to ensure that these individuals don't pose an ongoing threat to the United States.\nQ: Including surveillance -- I can imagine that, too, or at least some sort of a monitoring mechanism for these detainees once they're transferred.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, in some cases, we are able to work effectively with other countries to make sure that we keep tabs on the individuals who have been transferred to ensure that they don't pose an undue threat to the United States.\nQ: But does the American government pay these particular countries to take these guys?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the result of these transfers is a product of extensive diplomatic negotiations, and there are a lot of questions that are raised about the most effective place to house this person, the most effective way to ensure that this individual doesn't pose an undue threat to the United States or our allies or interests. But we don't typically get into too much detail about the kinds of requirements that are imposed on these individuals once they're transferred.\nQ: Are you familiar with BleachBit? Have you been following this technology that enables a person or persons to sort of wipe clean electronic trails? Are you familiar with that at all?\nMR. EARNEST: That's the first time I've heard that term.\nQ: Okay, it was apparently utilized by Secretary Clinton in an effort to wipe clean her personal server of emails. If you haven't heard anything about that, I was going to ask the follow-up, which would be: Is that something that this administration does not condone among not just Cabinet members but even among employees?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, our view here has been that government employees should use their government email for government work. And in those rare instances where they're unable to do so -- their iPhone or their Blackberry is acting up, then if that requires emergent use of their personal email, then they should be sure to CC their government address so that the records can be properly preserved. And that's the policy that we expect people to follow and I'm quite confident that the vast majority of government employees certainly does follow them.\nMy guess is that people's -- the degree to which people are conscientious about following that policy has probably improved in the last 12 to 18 months, I suspect.\nAndrew.\nQ: A cybersecurity question, Josh. I'm not sure if you've seen the reports that Apple was forced to update its operating system, its mobile operating system because of a hack that seems to be originated -- or seems to be targeted against Emirati human rights activists. I was wondering, is the U.S. government looking into this? Have you been in contact with Apple about it? And do you have any idea about who is behind this breach?\nMR. EARNEST: Andrew, I can tell you that I'm familiar with this news story. I've read about it. I'm not in a position to confirm any of the facts in the news story. I think what I can just say as a general matter is that the United States government understands that working effectively with U.S. technology companies is an important part of protecting the cybersecurity of the U.S. government and of the American people.\nAnd there have been some well-chronicled differences of opinion about how to most effectively pursue those policies, but it's the view of the administration that we need to continue to maintain a positive, constructive, working relationship with technology companies because we have a shared interest -- at least we have many shared interests. And the administration is committed to pursuing those shared interests, where they exist, in a way that would enhance the cybersecurity of the U.S. government and of the American people.\nQ: Do you know if the President has downloaded the update -- the security update -- on his iPad?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to any of the capabilities of the devices used by the President of the United States.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, can I follow up on Ron's question about the transition meeting yesterday? Can you provide us any insight into the tone of the meeting? Did the representatives of the two campaigns behave themselves? Were there any outbursts reflecting the rhetoric of the campaigns themselves?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of anything like that. I think everybody who was around the table understands the serious responsibility that they have to ensure the smooth and effective transition from the 44th President to the 45th President. And I think the tone of the meeting reflected the seriousness of the topic.\nQ: Do you know when there will be another meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know when the next meeting of the White House Transition Coordinating Council will take place, but we'll let you know.\nQ: Were you in the meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: I did not attend the meeting.\nQ: Is your office part of the transition operation?\nMR. EARNEST: At some point, I do anticipate being part of the effort to try to hand the reins over to the successor of my office, and --\nQ: Any thoughts on what you might tell them? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Not at this point. I suspect that there might be a difference in the way that advice is consumed and followed, but we'll see what happens. I certainly am committed to doing my part to ensure the continuing success of the White House Press Office and the relationship between the White House Press Office and the press corps that will be closely chronicling the activities of the next President of the United States.\nQ: And on the national monument expansion, how does the administration decide whether to expand it by 400,000 square miles, or more or less? How is that decision made?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are a couple of factors that go into this. The first is, obviously, the President is relying on the scientific advice of officials at NOAA and other prominent government scientists who can talk about steps that the President can take, using his executive authority, to protect this valuable area. There's also important input that we receive from local residents. When we're talking about a marine monument like this, we're obviously talking about people who live in the area. And obviously the native Hawaiian population views this area as quite special, if not sacred, and that's why built into the creation of this monument are opportunities for native populations to continue to engage in the kinds of activities that are consistent with their cultural heritage.\nThere also is -- I know that, for example, there also is an allowance that people, when they get a proper permit, that they can conduct private fishing operations in the area. I know that there's a limit on commercial activities in this region, but people who want to fish for themselves can get a permit from the government and potentially have it approved and be able to do so.\nThose are just two examples of how these kinds of designations are only enacted after robust conversation with the people who are most directly affected. And we saw that that certainly was true in Maine, when the President earlier this week designated some woodlands and waterways in Maine for special protection. There's a lot of important work that had been done with people in local communities there to not just minimize the negative impacts on their communities but also to try to maximize the positive impact. And there is the expectation -- I noted at the beginning the potential positive economic impact of these kinds of designations in the form of eco-tourism and other things.\nQ: And all of that protected water is U.S. federal waters?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, my understanding is all of this area is within the territorial waters of the United States of America.\nQ: A lot of waters.\nMR. EARNEST: It is. It is.\nJuliet.\nQ: A couple of follow-up questions on Papahanaumokuakea.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you for joining me.\nQ: Showoff. (Laughter.)\nQ: First, the President used his authority under the Antiquities Act fairly sparingly in his first term. He only did a couple of unilateral designations and they were relatively small in terms of land and water size. He's obviously invoked it quite frequently in his second term. Can you talk about what's propelled this shift for him to use the Antiquities Act as aggressively as he has in his second term?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think an important part of this, Juliet, is what I was just talking to Mark about, which is that these kinds of designations are not issued on short notice. These decisions are only made after extensive consultation with local communities. I know that there were -- I think this is true both in Maine and in Hawaii, that there were -- this is literally the culmination of a years-long effort to protect these pristine waters in Hawaii while ensuring that the way of life of native Hawaiians is also protected. And that requires a lot of negotiation and a lot of consultation and extensive follow-up. So that would account for some of this, which is that it took years to get this going and we're starting to enjoy the benefits of that work.\nI know that there also has been a realization that there is a role for Congress to play in terms of setting aside certain territory, lands and waters in the United States for future preservation, but we haven't seen a lot of congressional activity of any sort, really, over the last few years. And it has turned the President's attention to more robust use of executive action.\nThe President, I think in each of these cases, would be happy to sign into law a piece of legislation that would have protected these waters. But we haven't seen that kind of legislative activity in this Congress, and it means the President has had to make more effective use of his executive authority, and that's what he's done, in a way that will benefit not just people in Hawaii, but the American people for generations to come.\nQ: And then more broadly on marine monuments, a lot of scientists have talked about the importance of protecting areas closer to the continental United States -- in New England, in the Southeast, in the Gulf. These are proposals, again, that have been around for years but often tend to be controversial because they're close to major population centers. Can you talk about why up to this point the White House has focused on relatively remote areas in the Pacific as opposed to some of these other areas, which many scientists consider just as ecologically valuable?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I'm not going to rule out future decisions over the next five months or so. I think the thing that you can assume, Juliet, is that given the extensive consultation that I described over a large but remote stretch of water off the coast of Hawaii would engender more and more vigorous discussion when we're talking about waters that are closer to larger population centers.\nAnd again, I think it's further evidence that the Obama administration takes quite seriously the responsibility that we have to carefully consider the impact of these decisions on local populations and on local communities. And when done right, the impact of these designations is positive, both when it comes to economic questions, but also when it comes to questions about quality of life. And we're committed to trying to advance both those things in communities all across the country.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, in the aftermath of a court order against the Obama administration's guidance prohibiting schools to discriminate against transgender students, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent a letter to schools yesterday instructing them to disregard those guidelines. Should the letter from the attorney general be ignored?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I haven't seen the specific letter. The guidelines -- the guidance that was issued by the Department of Education was in response to schools and school districts and school administrators from across the country seeking the expertise of officials at the Department of Education about the most effective way to implement policies that protect the safety and dignity of all their students.\nThese school administrators don't have the luxury of playing politics. They're actually trying to solve problems. They're trying to protect kids. They're trying to create a learning environment in which every student has an opportunity to thrive. And it shouldn't be surprising that they're seeking the help of experts at the Department of Education about the most effective way to do that.\nSo what the Department of Education did was they collected best practices from school districts and school administrators all across the country, and they formulated those into guidance that school administrators could use in answering these questions that many of them face.\nSo that's the process that was our goal. Unfortunately, I don't think everybody shares the administration's commitment to prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of all of America's students over politics. Some politicians choose to do it the other way around, and that's unfortunate.\nQ: In the aftermath of the court order, is the administration enforcing Title 9 and civil rights law in general in the same way? Or has that changed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- I can't speak to any individual enforcement action, I can just say in general that the Obama administration has been committed to ensuring the rights of all Americans are protected. And that has been a consistent goal that we have pursued since day one of the Obama administration, and it's a goal that we're going to continue to pursue until the very last day.\nQ: Well, why can't you say -- speak to any enforcement action? The order says the administration cannot interpret the prohibition on sex discrimination under current law to apply to transgender people. Are you still doing that in the -- of the order, or is that not the case?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, as you know, this is a topic of vigorous dispute in a court of law, and so I certainly don't want to say anything that's going to influence the ability of the Department of Justice to make that argument.\nQ: One final question. The court order came down on Sunday, but the Justice Department has yet to file a notice of appeal for that order. Do you know why that is the case, almost a week out?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of the latest on the decision-making process at the Department of Justice, but I'm sure they can update you on our legal strategy moving forward.\nJohn.\nQ: Given the President's desire to get some things done before he leaves office, and given your own kind of assessments about Congress's likelihood of passing some of the legislation, or any legislation, is the President considering using more executive authority, more of his executive authority to check off some of that to-do list, even if it's smaller bites at the apple than legislation would be?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm not going to rule out additional executive action on the part of the President, but I also don't have any executive actions to preview at this point. We've been quite disappointed that Leader McConnell has broken the promise that he made the day after the election to get Congress moving again. And in fact, what we've seen instead is an utterly dysfunctional Congress, among the least productive in American history, and that's primarily because Republicans have been much more interested in playing politics than they have been in running the country. And there's been a failure on the part of Republicans to even act on common-sense things that have a direct impact on the daily lives of Americans.\nRepublicans in Congress have blocked adequate funding to fight the Zika virus. This is funding that was put forward by the Obama administration. But at the request of our nation's public health professionals, Democratic and Republican governors across the country have strongly encouraged Congress to act and they haven't. That's a failure of Republicans in Congress.\nRepublicans, of course, have refused to do their job when it comes to filling vacancies on the Supreme Court. The President has put forward an individual who is more qualified when you consider his tenure on the federal judiciary than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history. So he's got ample experience, he's been rated highly qualified, the highest rating of the American Bar Association, and he's been described by leading Republicans as a consensus nominee. But yet, Republicans have refused to move on that.\nRepublicans have also refused to move on budget bills, as well. And that's also been a source of some disappointment and I think something we're going to spend a lot of time talking about in September.\nAnd I think all of this is a reflection of the failure of Republicans to effectively handle their responsibilities in the congressional majorities.\nQ: Does he have any concerns about using executive authority on the way out the door, kind of how that would look -- the optics, controversy that might stir up?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, again, I don't want to prejudge any presidential actions, but we're hopeful that as we get down to the end, that Republicans will find a way to be somewhat more productive. But I'm certainly not going to take any executive actions off the table.\nQ: Just a quick follow-up on Gitmo. If the population can be shrunk down to, say, around the two dozen or so individuals who can't be transferred, can't be tried for various reasons, is there some effort within the administration to determine what to do with those individuals, assuming Republicans aren't going to lift some of the restrictions on those transfers?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, there's been a lot of -- the administration has been considering a wide variety of ideas for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. And the efforts to close the prison have been made much more difficult because of the actions of the Congress, which has been not to work to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, but to actually erect barriers to prevent the successful closure of the prison. That is contrary to the advice that we have received from Democratic and Republican foreign policy and national security experts, including leading military officers, retired military officers, who have indicated that the prison should be closed and that it's in our national security interest to close the prison.\nBut, yes, there are a variety of considerations and a variety of discussions that have been held about the most effective way to do this, but obviously that's not a goal that we've achieved yet.\nBill.\nQ: Florida's Governor asked for more Zika testing kits and a detailed plan to work with the federal government. HHS sent him a letter, which basically said that emergency supplemental funding requested by the administration is the most effective way to enhance the response. But there's obviously no chance of any kind of congressional action in the near term.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, unless Governor Scott wants to have a conversation with his fellow Republican, Mitch McConnell, and his fellow Republican, Speaker Paul Ryan, to try to move this process forward.\nQ: What's available now? I mean, are these supplemental funds still flowing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there is funding that we expect will allow us to essentially meet the bare minimum through the end of September. But each day that goes by is a missed opportunity, where the U.S. government is not doing everything possible, as described by our public health professionals, to protect the American people from the Zika virus. That's been quite disappointing.\nWhen it comes to the specific kits that have been requested by Governor Scott, I can tell you that the CDC -- Governor Scott requested 5,000 testing kits from the CDC. I can tell you that yesterday the CDC delivered 6,300 lab tests, and that's on top of the 2,000 that have already been provided.\nBut since February, I have been talking about how our diagnostic capabilities in the U.S. government are limited until additional congressional resources are provided to expand that capability. So this isn't some hypothetical way in which our response has been limited. This is a pretty tangible way in which our ability to respond to this situation is limited because of Republican congressional dysfunction.\nAnd again, we certainly would welcome high-ranking Republicans in the state of Florida, using their influence with the Republican leadership, to get them moving. Because thus far, we've gotten strong support from Democrats in Congress for fully funding the Zika response. It's congressional Republicans who have blocked it. And I certainly would expect people like Governor Scott, who is genuinely concerned about the safety and wellbeing of the people in his state, that certainly one way he could show some leadership here is invite Senator McConnell down to South Beach. Maybe Leader McConnell can apply some DEET, but he can also see firsthand --\nQ: I would imagine that the response of the person in the street who might be concerned about Zika is, what can you do for me today?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, and you know what could happen today, is we could have Congress maybe take a day off from their seven-day recess -- after all, they left a day early -- seven-week recess, my goodness, seven-week recess. They left a day early. Maybe they could --\nQ: Is there enough money to keep things moving until Congress returns?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what the folks at HHS have indicated is that, again, they can fund the bare minimum through the end of September. But each day that goes by until then is a missed opportunity for the U.S. government to be doing everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. If there were more resources available, there would be more people that we could put on the ground in states like Florida and Texas and Louisiana to do vector control. There certainly are more resources that could be dedicated to lab capacity and diagnostic tests. But, again, that's not happening because we haven't gotten the resources from Congress.\nJane, I'll give you the last one and then we'll do the week ahead.\nQ: Thank you very much, Josh. Violation of human rights in North Korea. Recently, high-ranking North Korean defectors were coming to South Korea. And North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, sent about the 300 North Korean soldiers to oversee -- to put a ban to defections. How would you think about the North Korean human rights situation?\nMR. EARNEST: The United States and the rest of the international community is deeply concerned about the human rights situation inside of North Korea. The North Korean regime has virtually enslaved the population of North Korea and subjected them to despicable living conditions, all because of the policies that are pursued by the North Korean regime. And it's distressing what millions of North Koreans have to endure in their daily lives.\nSo we have deep concerns about the human rights situation inside of North Korea. We also have deep concerns about the continued willingness of the North Korean regime to engage in provocative actions and utterly disregard international norms and rules when it comes to some of their military programs. So we've got a long list of concerns. We spend more time talking about our concerns about their missile program and their nuclear program, but our concerns about the human rights situation in North Korea are quite deep.\nQ: So do you have any special action to prevent to the North Korea to do so?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I just would say that it's our policy that we would like to see an improvement on the Korean Peninsula, both with regard to the North Korean government's commitment to following international rules related to their missile program, but we'd also like to see them take steps to address the significant human rights concerns that have been expressed by the international community.\nLet's do the week ahead here and then, Mark, we'll let you get started on your weekend. (Laughter.)\nOn Monday and Tuesday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\nOn Wednesday, as you know, the President will travel to Lake Tahoe, Nevada, to deliver remarks to the 20th Annual Lake Tahoe Summit and highlight his commitment to protecting the environment and addressing climate change. That evening, the President will travel to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he will deliver remarks to leaders from the Pacific Island Conference of Leaders and the IUCN World Conservation Congress, which is being hosted in the United States for the very first time. The President will remain overnight, on Wednesday night, in Honolulu.\nOn Thursday, the President will travel to the Midway Atoll, located within the newly established Marine National Monument, to mark the significance of this monument designation and highlight firsthand how the threat of climate change makes protecting our public lands and waters more important than ever. The President will remain overnight in Honolulu.\nOn Friday, the President will travel to Hangzhou, China. This trip will highlight the President's ongoing commitment to the G20 as the premier form for international economic cooperation as well as the U.S. rebalance to Asia and the Pacific.\nOn Saturday, the President will arrive in Hangzhou, China and will conduct in-depth meetings with President Xi Jinping of China, where the two leaders will discuss a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues. The President will remain overnight in Hangzhou.\nOn Sunday, the President will participate in his final G20 Leaders Summit, where he will emphasize the need to continue building on the progress made since 2009 in advancing strong, sustainable and balanced global economic growth. He will underscore the importance of G20 cooperation and promoting a level playing field and broad-based economic opportunity. The President will spend Sunday night in Hangzhou.\nWe'll have additional details about the rest of the President's travel next week. But obviously, from China, the President will travel to Laos, where he will participate in meetings with the ASEAN countries and in the East Asia Summit.\nHave a good weekend, everybody. We'll see you on Monday.\nEND 1:12 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-08-26", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Building on the United States' global leadership in marine conservation, today's designation will more than quadruple the size of the existing marine monument, permanently protecting pristine coral reefs, deep sea marine habitats, and important ecological resources in the waters of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.\nFollowing this historic conservation action, the President will travel to Hawaii next week. On Wednesday evening, he will address leaders from the Pacific Island Conference of Leaders and the IUCN World Conservation Congress, which is being hosted in the United States for the first time. On Thursday, he will travel to Midway Atoll, located within the Papah?naumoku?kea Marine National Monument, to mark the significance of this monument designation and highlight first-hand how the threat of climate change makes protecting our public lands and waters more important than ever.\nThe monument was originally created in 2006 by President George W. Bush and designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. Since that time, new scientific exploration and research has revealed new species and deep sea habitats as well as important ecological connections between the existing monument and the adjacent waters. Today's designation will expand the existing Marine National Monument by 442,781 square miles, bringing the total protected area of the expanded monument to 582,578 square miles.\nThe expansion provides critical protections for more than 7,000 marine species, including whales and sea turtles listed under the Endangered Species Act and the longest-living marine species in the world — black coral, which have been found to live longer than 4,500 years. Additionally, as ocean acidification, warming, and other impacts of climate change threaten marine ecosystems, expanding the monument will improve ocean resilience, help the region's distinct physical and biological resources adapt, and create a natural laboratory that will allow scientists to monitor and explore the impacts of climate change on these fragile ecosystems.\nThe expanded monument area also contains resources of great historical and cultural significance. The expanded area, including the archipelago and its adjacent waters, is considered a sacred place for the Native Hawaiian community. It plays a significant role in Native Hawaiian creation and settlement stories, and is used to practice important activities like traditional long-distance voyaging and wayfinding. Additionally, within the monument expansion area, there are shipwrecks and downed aircraft from the Battle of Midway in World War II, a battle that marked a major shift in the progress of the war in favor of the Allies.\nAll commercial resource extraction activities, including commercial fishing and any future mineral extraction, are prohibited in the expansion area, as they are within the boundaries of the existing monument. Noncommercial fishing, such as recreational fishing and the removal of fish and other resources for Native Hawaiian cultural practices, is allowed in the expansion area by permit, as is scientific research.\nIn recognition of the value of Papah?naumoku?kea to Native Hawaiians, and in keeping with President Obama's commitment to elevating the voices of Native peoples in management of our resources, Secretary of the Interior Jewell and Secretary of Commerce Pritzker also announced that the Departments will soon sign an agreement with Hawaii's Department of Natural Resources and Office of Hawaiian Affairs providing for a greater management role as a trustee in the Papah?naumoku?kea Marine National Monument. This arrangement has been previously requested by Senator Brian Schatz and Governor Ige.\nToday's action by President Obama responds to a proposal put forward by Senator Schatz and prominent Native Hawaiian leaders, in addition to significant input and local support from Hawaii elected officials, cultural groups, conservation organizations, scientists and fishermen. This step also builds on a rich tradition of marine protection in Hawaiian waters and world-class, well managed fisheries, including a longline fishing fleet that is a global leader in sustainable practices.\nIn addition to protecting more land and water than any Administration in history, President Obama has sought to lead the world in marine conservation by combating illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, revitalizing the process for establishing new marine sanctuaries, establishing the National Ocean Policy, and promoting ocean stewardship through the use of science- based decision making.", "timestamp": "2016-08-26", "title": "Fact Sheet: President Obama to Create the World's Largest Marine Protected Area"}

We should encourage more businesses to join them.\"\n-President Barack Obama, United State of Women Summit, June 14, 2016\nToday, on Women's Equality Day, we are announcing new signatories to the White House Equal Pay Pledge. This pledge was launched at the first-ever United State of Women Summit, encouraging companies from across the American economy to take action to advance equal pay. These 29 newly-committed employers bring the total number to more than fifty companies and organizations that collectively employ millions of Americans. The new commitments are from a diverse range of employers, including Apple, CVS, Facebook, Target, and Visa.\nEqual Pay has been an Administration priority since President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law as his first piece of legislation. Policies that ensure fair pay for all Americans and that help businesses to attract the strongest talent can not only narrow the pay gap, but also boost productivity and benefit our economy.\nAs noted in the President's  Proclamation on Women's Equality Day, this day commemorates the 1920 certification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, granting women the right to vote. It is also the day that we observe the continued work towards gender equity for all women and girls.\nView the additional commitments and statements from signatories below, and learn more about President Obama's record on empowering women and girls.\nBy signing the Equal Pay Pledge, these employers are:\n•      Acknowledging the critical role businesses must play in reducing the national pay gap.\n•      Committing to conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across occupations.\n•      Reviewing hiring and promotion processes and procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers.\n•      Embedding equal pay efforts into broader enterprise-wide equity initiatives.\n•      Pledging to take these steps as well as identify and promote other best practices that will close the national wage gap to ensure fundamental fairness for all workers.\nCompanies and organizations interested in signing are encouraged to take the Equal Pay Pledge here.\n***\nWHITE HOUSE EQUAL PAY PLEDGE\nThe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first piece of legislation President Obama signed into law. Policies that ensure fair pay for all Americans and that help businesses attract the strongest talent can not only narrow the gender pay gap, but also boost productivity and benefit our economy. Yet, the typical woman working full-time all year in the United States only earns 79 percent of what a typical man working full-time all year earns. While the gap has narrowed slightly over the past few years, there is much more work to be done to ensure fair pay for all.\nBuilding on the Administration's numerous actions to close the national pay gap, the White House challenged businesses to take the Equal Pay Pledge. Several U.S. private sector companies have come together in support of advancing equal pay.\n***\nWe received a very positive response to the pledge and welcome our new signatories, including the employers below.\nThese signatories put forth their pledges as follows:\nA.T. Kearney: A.T. Kearney is passionate about and committed to diversity and inclusion. We provide our employees with equal opportunities to contribute, develop, and succeed irrespective of gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. Diversity enables us to achieve immediate impact and growing advantage – for our clients, our people and the communities in which we work and live. We believe that equal pay to promote diversity and inclusion is a business imperative.\nOur approach to diversity and inclusion has and will continue to evolve with the changing needs of our business and our people. We offer global programs that create an inclusive environment and culture, ensuring all employees feel comfortable bringing their best selves to work each day. We enable our employees to achieve their personal and professional aspirations. A.T. Kearney is proud to collaborate with the White House and enthusiastically adds our name to the Equal Pay Pledge.\nAkamai Technologies: Akamai Technologies is pleased to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge. This pledge aligns with the expectations we have of ourselves to lead with a sense of transparency, while embracing diversity and respect for all employees.\nAt Akamai, we seek to ensure every employee can work in an environment where they are valued and able to work at their best. We believe in fair and equitable pay for all our employees, and we are committed to monitoring our pay practices regularly and to making adjustments if necessary to deliver on this pledge.\nAnheuser-Busch: Anheuser-Busch is proud to sign the Equal Pay Pledge. We value equality throughout all levels of our organization, and believe diversity enriches our workforce. This commitment to inclusivity begins with our mission - to be the best beer company, bringing people together for a better world - and extends to our meritocracy-based compensation practices.\nAt Anheuser-Busch, we believe in equal pay for equal work. We use a rigorous and gender-blind compensation process that was developed and validated by independent experts. We recognize that there is still much work to do to create a truly equal playing field in the workforce. It is our ambition to lead the change and create more opportunities for women in the beer industry.\nToday, six of our 12 U.S. breweries are led by female head brewmasters, and women now represent the majority (51 percent) of our marketing organization. In support of our workforce and their families, this year we introduced a new parental leave policy that offers 100% paid Parental Bonding leave for all parents, on top of paid Maternity Leave for a birth mother.\nApple: Equal work deserves equal pay. This past year, Apple looked at the total compensation for U.S. employees and closed the gaps we found. We've achieved pay equity in the United States for similar roles and performance. Women employees at Apple earn one dollar for every dollar male employees earn. We're now analyzing the salaries, bonuses, and annual stock grants of all our employees worldwide. If a gap exists, we'll address it. And we'll continue our work to make sure we maintain pay equity.\nChobani: Since day one, diversity and inclusiveness have been at the core of Chobani. We're proud to stand with other leading businesses to give one voice to a simple, common sense principle: women deserve equal pay for equal work.\nWe were founded with the belief that everyone on our team deserves the same chance to achieve their dreams and live up to their full potential. By joining the White House in taking this important pledge, we're committing to continuously reviewing our practices to ensure that, as we grow, we never stray from our founding principles – and that our hiring, promotion and compensation practices and procedures stick to our deeply-held belief that women deserve equal opportunity.\nThe Coca-Cola Company: The Coca-Cola Company values and celebrates diversity. This includes a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity that spans our employment practices and development of existing employees. There is overwhelming evidence that achieving equality and empowerment for women has both immediate impacts that benefit them directly and broader ripple effects that are good for society. We have made meaningful strides as a company in our equal opportunity efforts. Still, we recognize there is more we can learn by building upon best practices across the U.S. private sector. We are pleased, therefore, to join the Equal Pay Pledge and work with the Administration and other partners towards reducing the national gender pay gap.\nCVS Health: At CVS Health, we are committed to fulfilling our company's purpose of helping people on their path to better health by living our values, including integrity, accountability, caring, collaboration and innovation.\nBy living our values, we embrace a dedication to paying our colleagues equitably regardless of their gender. We take a purposeful and systematic approach to evaluate compensation to ensure we are accountable to our pay equity commitment.\nWe actively work to seek out, listen to and leverage the voices of our diverse colleagues, customers, clients, and communities. For our company, diversity and innovation go hand in hand and we strive to model best practices to promote and develop diverse talent. Our CEO serves as the executive sponsor of CVS Health's Women's Success Network, one of our largest Colleague Resource Groups. And we have been recognized as a best practice company by the 20/20 Women on Boards Initiative.\nWe value the contributions of all of our colleagues and we are proud to join other leading employers in signing this pledge and making a commitment to this important issue.\nDelta Air Lines: At Delta Air Lines, the very nature of our business is bringing people together. We rely on a worldwide family of Delta Air Lines people 80,000 strong to care for our customers and ensure they get where they're going promptly and safely, regardless of the origin or destination. Our success is built on diversity, where our differences make us stronger and all people are welcomed, supported and – above all – treated equally.\nWe're proud to join the White House in signing the Equal Pay Pledge and voicing our commitment to fairness and diversity in the workplace, which is reflective of our long-standing commitment of pay equality among all Delta Air Lines employees.\nDropbox: Dropbox is honored to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge and join the other companies who have taken a stand on this issue. Gender equality and equal pay are priorities for us, and they are part of our deep commitment to creating an equitable workplace that includes and supports employees of every background and identity. Our products are used around the globe by millions of people from all cultures and backgrounds, and our team needs to reflect the world we're building for.\nAt Dropbox we review all of our hiring and HR processes for potential bias, including a gender impact analysis at every compensation and promotion cycle. Additionally, we've built inclusive leadership into our framework for managers, and all of our senior leadership and nearly all of our employees have participated in unconscious bias training.\nWhile we are proud of our track record of compensating our employees fairly and equitably — from our most junior team members to our senior leaders — we know there is more work to be done in order to create a world in which both men and women have the same opportunities and choices.\nDunkin' Brands: Dunkin' Brands is committed to gender pay equity, and we are honored to join the White House in the Equal Pay Pledge. At Dunkin' Brands we regularly review our pay practices to ensure pay equity and strongly believe that a corporate culture in which each person is valued, respected and earns equal pay for equal work, delivers better business results.\nEY: EY is committed to pay equity and a culture of inclusion. Equity in opportunities, advancement, and compensation is a business imperative, and we work hard to promote fair practices for all of our women and men. EY's leadership is actively engaged in fostering gender equality at EY and in the marketplace.\nFacebook: At Facebook we value those who bring varying perspectives, for many reasons including background, community, culture, race, ethnicity - and gender. We call this cognitive diversity, and we want more of it. It propels our mission: to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.\nFacebook is a longtime supporter of equal pay. We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure pay equity, and have done so for many years. We complete thorough statistical analyses to compare the compensation of men and women performing similar work. As such, we are proud to share that at Facebook, men and women earn the same. We encourage efforts to establish methods to close the wage gaps around the world.\nGeneral Motors: General Motors is pleased to sign The White House Equal Pay Pledge. We believe strongly in gender equity, and we are dedicated to having a diverse and welcoming workplace that values the contributions of all employees.\nWe know that a diverse workforce promotes fresh, innovative thinking that translates into both a competitive advantage for GM and winning products for our customers. To this end, among other efforts, GM has employee resource groups, whose mission is to attract, engage, develop and retain a diverse mix of talented employees to positively affect GM's performance, through networking and professional development opportunities.\nGM is supporting this pledge because it reflects our shared belief that employees' gender should not factor into compensation decisions. We believe that fair and equitable pay should be an essential element of any successful business model and are proud to stand with other companies that share this same value.\nThe Hartford: At The Hartford, gender equality is a top business priority. The Hartford prides itself on its diverse workforce and inclusive culture, and its commitment to equality for ALL employees. The Hartford, recently named as one of twenty-six firms on Bloomberg Financial Services Gender-Equality Index for demonstrating strong commitment to gender equality, is proud to take the next step in signing the White House's Equal Pay Pledge.\nThe Hershey Company: At The Hershey Company, diversity and inclusion is a commitment that is embedded in who we are. It's about advancing our vision, our culture, and our environment, so everyone can bring a meaningful contribution. As part of this commitment, we believe that discrimination has no place in our workforce, which is why we have a no-tolerance policy.\nOur policy is to extend opportunities and terms and conditions of employment to qualified applicants and employees on an equal basis regardless of an individual's race, color, gender, age, national origin, religion, citizenship status, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, physical or mental disability, protected veteran status, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other categories protected by applicable law. For wages, this includes equal pay for equal work.\nHilton: At Hilton, we are proud of our long history of supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our goal is clear - we strive for an inclusive work environment that allows all of our Team Members to be comfortable bringing their entire selves to work every day. Simply put, our culture is a reflection of the backgrounds, passions and perspectives of all of our Team Members around the world. To be the most hospitable company in the world, we must also represent the many different cultures, backgrounds and viewpoints of our guests, which includes supporting and empowering women at every level of our organization. In fact, women make up more than 50 percent of our global workforce.\nIn this regard, we are honored to join the White House in signing the Equal Pay Pledge. We are committed to advancing our efforts in ensuring equity not only in our pay practices, but also across recruitment, learning and development, benefits, and our overall Team Member value proposition. In doing so, we continue to deliver on our promise of a great environment, great careers and great rewards for all of our Team Members.\nSupporting women in the workplace is part of who we are. In fact, we provide a wide-range of opportunities for women such as our Women's Team Member Resource Group, Women's Executive Networking Program, and Women in Leadership Excellence Program in partnership with the University of Virginia. Most recently, we were honored to be selected by DiversityInc as one of the Top 50 Companies for Diversity, the Human Rights Campaign rated us at 100 percent on their Corporate Equality Index, and Professional Woman's Magazine named us as a Top Diversity Employer of Women. We were also chosen by the Pax Ellevate Global Women's Index Fund for being one of the highest-rated companies in the world for advancing women leadership. Additionally, we are committed to offering family-focused benefits across our hotels and offices, including our industry-leading maternity leave policy, flexible working environments, 10-day advanced scheduling, paid time off, and educational assistance.\nIBM: In 1935, IBM founder Thomas J. Watson Sr. said, \"Men and women will do the same kind of work for equal pay. They will have the same treatment, the same responsibilities and the same opportunities for advancement.\"\nIBM established a broad equal opportunity policy more than a decade before the Civil Rights Act, and we have maintained and continually improved a formal pay analysis and adjustment process for women and minority employees for 40 years.\nAnd now, in IBM's second century as a company, we remain firmly dedicated to providing fair pay based on job responsibilities and performance, which is critical to meeting today's evolving business and technology challenges. IBM is proud to sign the White House's Equal Pay pledge as another step in our long history of fostering fairness, diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\nIKEA US: IKEA is a values-driven company, and our approach to diversity and inclusion is grounded in our values. We believe in people and see each individual as a talent. We treat each other fairly and provide our co-workers with equal opportunities, regardless of their gender identity, age, sexual orientation, physical ability, ethnicity, race, nationality, or any other dimension of their identity.\nWe know that each individual adds value to the team, and we are committed to creating an inclusive work environment that encourages our diverse and competent co-workers to be themselves, to apply their unique perspectives at work, and to assume responsibility for our growth. In addition to being the right thing to do, creating this environment also improves our business results and strengthens our competitiveness.\nSeveral years ago, IKEA launched a proactive global effort to increase the diversity of our workforce at all levels. As part of this, we took – and will continue to take – a hard look at all areas of gender equality, including workforce representation, hiring, career development, succession planning, promotion rates, and pay equity. Over the coming years, we will maintain a comprehensive approach to diversity and inclusion across the entire organization, including pay equality.\nWe are proud to take the Equal Pay Pledge to ensure fairness for all our co-workers, and to join the many companies contributing to a better society by leading on this issue.\nIntel: Signing the Equal Pay Pledge for Intel is a natural extension of our longstanding commitment to paying our employees fairly and equitably at all levels of the organization. We hold ourselves accountable with data by conducting an annual, comprehensive audit of pay in the U.S. to analyze our employees' pay by gender and ethnicity. In 2015 we conducted a comprehensive compensation analysis examining gender pay parity for U.S. employees across job types and levels. The report showed a net result of 100% pay parity, and we're incredibly proud of this result. Our commitment to diversity comes from our conviction that reaching a critical mass of women and underrepresented minorities in our industry brings ample benefits to many.\nThe Libra Group: The Libra Group heartily supports the Equal Pay Pledge. As an employer we are age, sex, orientation, race and religion blind. Yet we are acutely aware that the wage gap is very often a symptom of a broader opportunity gap that may affect some population groups more than others, notably women. So wage parity begins with opportunity parity, which is why so many of our group's social responsibility programs focus on groups who are experiencing disproportionate lack of educational and career opportunity. In many cases this means providing work experience, or equipping under-served communities with the advice, mentoring, training and support they need to acquire leadership skills or get a new business off the ground.\nFor the fortunate few we are able to break the cycle of disadvantage and give a helping hand – but there is still more to be done. In our experience tomorrow's leaders emerge from the most unlikely places. Thus we believe that narrowing the pay gap depends on two things: a culture of equal opportunity and equal treatment within the work environment, combined with selective positive action and intervention to lift people out of endemic disadvantage and give them the chance they deserve.\nLinkedIn: LinkedIn's vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. We are committed to ensuring all of our employees have equal opportunities to succeed and be recognized for their accomplishments.\nAt the core of economic opportunity is equal pay for equal work. We believe it is basic good business to ensure this is true within your own organization, and we regularly review and evaluate our pay practices to ensure our employees are compensated fairly.\nIn addition, our ongoing focus on improving the gender diversity of our employee base continues to have meaningful impact with gains in women's representation in both technical and leadership roles over the last several years. The Women's Initiative (WIN) within our Global Sales team and the Women in Technology initiative (WIT) within our Engineering and Product organizations have built a framework to successfully hire, retain, develop and advance women.\nWe are committed to continuing to create diverse teams in an inclusive work environment where every person feels they truly belong and are paid fairly.\nMailChimp: Equal pay is an essential part of MailChimp's culture of inclusion, and we're grateful for the opportunity to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge. We conduct annual pay and benefits analyses, in addition to focusing on fair hiring and interviewing practices, generous family leave policies, flexible work schedules, employee-led resource groups, leadership development opportunities for employees at every level, and meaningful corporate citizenship programs.\nIt is unacceptable that women working full-time earn only 79 percent of what men earn, and unacceptable that the gap is even greater for women of color. MailChimp promises to do our part to close that gap. We are committed to empowering all of our employees and helping them succeed both within our organization and out in the world.\nMicrosoft: Microsoft is proud to join others in the effort to drive greater pay equality among men and women, which is a critical component of social progress. When women are fully engaged in our workforce and communities, society at large benefits from the great ideas and innovation that flourishes. Our commitment to equal pay gives us the opportunity to attract and hire from a broader talent pool of the best employees, managers and leaders—while gaining important insights into consumers' needs. In addition to gender pay equality, we are also committed to ensuring that all employees have equal opportunity.\nMuleSoft: MuleSoft has signed the Equal Pay Pledge as a testament to our continued commitment to creating a great place to work for everyone. MuleSoft has a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity, and we believe people should be paid equally for equal work and experience. We conduct an annual audit of our compensation, which we readily use to influence changes in our policies. Ensuring that we all have the same platform for opportunities, growth, and compensation is core to our ethos and success. We're committed to providing a workplace where everyone is supported and inspired by the opportunity to build a successful company where we can do what we love and thrive.\nNike: Today, we are proud to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge. At Nike, diversity is about acknowledging and valuing our differences and appreciating that everyone brings unique experiences, perspectives and ideas to the team. Investing in our employees to unleash their potential translates into a pipeline of new ideas, methods, and products that drive the future of sport.\nIn keeping with our culture and what we stand for as an organization, we remain committed to equitable pay and rewarding performance across all roles, for all Nike team members.\nBy signing the White House Equal Pay Pledge, we're adding our voice to a movement that we hope will inspire positive change.\nPatagonia: Since they founded Patagonia in a small Tin Shed more than 40 years ago, Yvon and Malinda Chouinard have worked hard to build a culture where women and families thrive. Today, Patagonia continues to value and honor our working women with equal pay and opportunity. We believe women shouldn't have to make the unnecessary choice between family and career and they can grow a career at the same pace as a family. At Patagonia, thanks to onsite child care, nursing moms are a few feet away from their babies versus miles apart. New moms and dads take paid time off to bond with and care for infants and families can eat breakfast and lunch together daily. We have an equal number of women and men at every level of the company, including among executive positions and the boardroom. Women and men are paid equally for comparable work. All of these things amount to a work environment where 100 percent of women return to work from maternity leave, 100 percent of dads take paid time off from work to bond with their new babies, and the business thrives as a result of the working families we support in our business.\nWe also believe that there is so much more to be done to reinforce the true drivers of pay equality – such as paid maternity and paternity leave, quality on-site childcare, and a family-supportive work environment – which allow working moms and dads to continue to grow their family, career and income with equal opportunity. Patagonia commits to continuing to build on the progress we've made and supporting working families through every avenue possible as we continue to grow our business in line with the values we were founded on.\n\"Women will never be able to effectively \"lean in\" without the proper economic, social and community support for the most critical work of all: raising children.\"\n-Rose Marcario – CEO, Patagonia\nTarget: At Target, we believe diversity and inclusivity make teams and Target better. We work to create a diverse and inclusive working environment and cultivate an inclusive guest experience, building a better Target for our team members and guests – and a better society for all.\nTarget is honored to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge and affirm our commitment to making pay equitable for everyone at Target, including women in the workplace. To achieve our goal of pay equity, we've implemented meaningful business practices, including continued leadership training designed, in part, to reduce the likelihood that leaders' decisions are improperly influenced by bias or stereotyping. We also use other internal measures, such as a comprehensive annual pay audit process, to ensure compensation is fair and equitable across the organization.\nAdditionally, earlier this year, Target CEO Brian Cornell joined PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi to co-chair the Network of Executive Women's Future Fund – an industry-wide campaign aimed at achieving 50/50 gender parity in the workforce. We've also earned a spot on the list for the Top Companies for Executive Women from the National Association for Female Executives for the past four years.\nWe are proud of our internal initiatives and external partnerships, and we remain committed to improving pay processes and policies that ensure equality and fairness for all.\nUnilever: At Unilever, we strive to create a bright future and believe business has a critical part to play in closing the national gender gap. As part of our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan - which is our blueprint to grow our business, while decoupling our environmental footprint from our growth and increasing our positive social impact - we have the ambition to empower the lives of five million women by 2020.\nUnilever is in a strong position to help empower women around the world: over 70% of our consumers are women and they play essential roles in our value chain. Unilever is proud to take the Equal Pay Pledge and confirm our commitment to gender equality. We consider the advancement of women's economic inclusion a business priority and by promoting the formal and active participation of women in the economy—we aim to transform lives, families, communities and economies and in turn, have the opportunity to grow our markets, brands and business.\nOver the past six years, Unilever has been in the process of making sure we have gender balance throughout our business. We are currently at 49% gender balance for managers and above in North America and continue to strive to foster an environment where each individual feels uniquely valued and has equal opportunities.\nUnilever is committed to creating a working environment that promotes diversity and equal opportunity. We are proud to have developed an inclusive culture and respect the contribution of all employees regardless of gender, age, race, disability or sexual orientation.\nVisa: Universal acceptance for everyone, everywhere is not only our brand promise, it's the foundation of our company culture. Diversity and inclusion is a strategic imperative at Visa, and it requires equal pay for equal work. We regularly review our compensation practices and conduct thorough analyses to ensure pay equity.\nAn inclusive workplace enhances and enriches our environment, successfully drives business results and leads to improved leadership effectiveness and employee engagement. We will continue to take meaningful steps to make progress in this important journey. And we're proud to sign this pledge as way of affirming our commitment to pay equity for our female employees in the U.S.", "timestamp": "2016-08-26", "title": "Fact Sheet: White House Announces New Commitments to the Equal Pay Pledge"}

Standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. uttered words now etched forever in our nation's history:\n'I have a dream, that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'\n\"His call to action sparked the momentum needed to pass the Voting Rights Act –  knocking down legal barriers that had stood for generations, and ensuring every American could exercise their constitutional right to vote.\n\"In 2016, we've come a long way since the days of Jim Crow.

Something is profoundly wrong when decades after Dr. King addressed the nation, so many Americans still feel that their country values them less, simply because of the color of their skin.\n\"That's just one reason why the stakes in this election are unlike any we have faced before. Those brave men and women who marched, and sat, and bled for civil rights in America must not have done so in vain.\n\"As President, I'll stand up to bluster and bigotry, and fight back against efforts to restrict access to the ballot. Let's make it easier for people to vote, not harder. Let's make sure every state has at least 20 days of in-person voting, and no one ever has to wait more than 30 minutes to cast their ballot. And let's automatically register every American to vote on their 18th birthday.\n\"The power of American democracy comes from the fact that no one is left behind – no matter where they come from, what they look like, or who they love. That's what I mean when I say that we're stronger together.\n\"So today, let's continue to be inspired by the self-evident truths that first united our nation, and live up to what a young minister dreamed and declared fifty-three years ago.\"", "timestamp": "2016-08-27", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on The March on Washington Anniversary"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The address was recorded at approximately 11:10 a.m. on August 26 in the Roosevelt Room at the White House for broadcast on August 27. In the address, the President referred to Clinton, SC, resident Ashley Young, and her daughter Savannah; and Sen. Marco A. Rubio. The transcript was made available by the Office of the Press Secretary on August 26, but was embargoed for release until 6 a.m. on August 27.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118840", "text": "Earlier this year, I got a letter from a South Carolina woman named Ashley, who was expecting her third child. She was, in her words, \"extremely concerned\" about the Zika virus, and what it might mean for other pregnant women like her.\nI understand that concern. As a father, Ashley's letter has stuck with me, and it's why we've been so focused on the threat of the Zika virus. So today I just want to take a few minutes to let you know what we've been doing in response and to talk about what more we can all do.\nSince late last year, when the most recent outbreak of Zika started popping up in other countries, Federal agencies like the Center for Disease Control and Prevention have been preparing for it to arrive in the U.S. In February, more than 6 months ago, I asked Congress for the emergency resources that public health experts say we need to combat Zika. That includes things like mosquito control, tracking the spread of the virus, accelerating new diagnostic tests and vaccines, and monitoring women and babies with the virus.\nRepublicans in Congress did not share Ashley's \"extreme concern,\" nor that of other Americans expecting children. They said no. Instead, we were forced to use resources we need to keep fighting Ebola, cancer, and other diseases. We took that step because we have a responsibility to protect the American people. But that's not a sustainable solution. And Congress has been on a 7-week recess without doing anything to protect Americans from the Zika virus.\nSo my administration has done what we can on our own. Our primary focus has been protecting pregnant women and families planning to have children. For months now, the CDC has been working closely with officials in Florida and other States. NIH and other agencies have moved aggressively to develop a vaccine. And we're working with the private sector to develop more options to test for and prevent infection. For weeks, a CDC emergency response team has been on the ground in South Florida, working alongside the excellent public health officials there, folks who have a strong track record of responding aggressively to the mosquitoes that carry viruses like Zika. They know what they're doing.\nStill, there's a lot more everybody can and should do. And that begins with some basic facts. Zika spreads mainly through the bite of a certain mosquito. Most infected people don't show any symptoms. But the disease can cause brain defects and other serious problems when pregnant women become infected. Even if you're not pregnant, you can play a role in protecting future generations. Because Zika can be spread through unprotected sex, it's not just women who need to be careful; men do too. That includes using condoms properly.\nIf you live in or travel to an area where Zika has been found, protect yourself against the mosquitoes that carry this disease. Use insect repellant, and keep using it for a few weeks, even after you come home. Wear long sleeves and long pants to make bites less likely. Stay in places with air conditioning and window screens. If you can, get rid of standing water where mosquitoes breed. And to learn more about how to keep your family safe, just visit CDC.gov.\nBut every day that Republican leaders in Congress wait to do their job, every day our experts have to wait to get the resources they need, and that has real-life consequences. It means weaker mosquito control efforts, longer wait times to get accurate diagnostic results, delayed vaccines. It puts more Americans at risk.\nOne Republican Senator said that \"there's no such thing as a Republican position on Zika or Democratic position on Zika, because these mosquitoes bite everyone.\" I agree. And we need more Republicans to act that way, because this is more important than politics. It's about young moms like Ashley. Today, her new baby Savannah is healthy and happy. And that's got to be priority number one.\nThat's why Republicans in Congress should treat Zika like the threat that it is and make this their first order of business when they come back to Washington after Labor Day. That means working in a bipartisan way to fully fund our Zika response. A fraction of the funding won't get the job done. You can't solve a fraction of a disease. Our experts know what they're doing. They just need the resources to do it.\nSo, to all Americans out there, make your voices heard. And you should know that as long as I'm President, we're going to keep doing everything we can to slow the spread of this virus and put our children's futures first.

While refugee admissions are only a small part of our broader humanitarian efforts in Syria and the region, the President understood the important message this decision would send, not just to the Syrian people but to the broader international community. As such, he set a goal of admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. Millions have been displaced by the violence in the region, but this decision still represented a six-fold increase from the prior year, and was a meaningful step that we hope to build upon.\nToday, I am pleased to announce that we will meet this goal more than a month ahead of schedule. Our 10,000th Syrian refugee will arrive this afternoon. On behalf of the President and his Administration, I extend the warmest of welcomes to each and every one of our Syrian arrivals, as well as the many other refugees resettled this year from all over the world. We will admit at least 85,000 refugees in total this year, including vulnerable individuals and families from Burma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, El Salvador, Iraq, Somalia, Ukraine, and many other countries.\nThis achievement is a testament to the hard work and dedication of employees across the federal government. Their commitment to meeting the President's expectation that we both increase our refugee admissions and strengthen the integrity of the refugee program, including its stringent security screening protocols, has been essential to this effort. We are also grateful to our many partners in international organizations and NGOs that play key roles in the program. Above all, we thank the many generous communities throughout our country that have continued to open their arms to these new neighbors, demonstrating the values that have made our nation great.\nWith 65 million people displaced, including more than 21 million refugees, we are facing a significant global challenge. Therefore, even as we have achieved this particular objective, we continue our work to strengthen the international response to humanitarian crises around the world. In late September, world leaders will gather at the 71st session of the UN General Assembly. There, President Obama will convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees, highlighting the continued leadership of the United States on humanitarian issues and the significant contributions partner countries have made this year. The United States has committed to work with the international community to significantly increase humanitarian assistance funding, double the global number of refugees afforded opportunities for resettlement or other humanitarian admissions, and help empower refugees in countries of asylum. Together, we can build a more sustainable and responsive humanitarian system capable of meeting today's unprecedented global humanitarian challenges.", "timestamp": "2016-08-29", "title": "Press Release - Statement by National Security Advisor Susan E.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for corrections, marked with asterisks.\n1:40 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. It's nice to see you all. Happy Monday.\nAs advertised, I am joined by several members of the President's senior staff to discuss with you the President's travels over the next 10 days or so. To my immediate right is Ben Rhodes, the President's Deputy National Security Advisor. Ben will provide you an overview of the schedule and some of the topline priorities for the trip.\nTo his right, you guys know Brian Deese, the President's Senior Advisor, who has been leading many of our efforts on climate change, and there's been some important work that the President has been doing and will be focused on over the course of this trip, both here in the United States and overseas. Brian has been at the forefront of those efforts and can talk to you about that.\nAnd then to his right is the President's Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics, Wally Adeyemo. And Wally, before he came to the White House, did a significant stint at the Treasury Department. And Wally can give you a sense of some of the work that has gone into preparing for the G20 meeting in China and he'll provide some valuable historical context about the important work that has been done at the G20 over the last seven years, since President Obama has been in office, and discuss how the United States and the world have benefitted from those efforts.\nSo with that long windup, what we'll do is each of these gentlemen will deliver some opening remarks at the top and then they'll stick around for 15 minutes or so to take your questions on these topics.\nSo, Ben, with that, why don't I turn it over to you?\nMR. RHODES: Great. Thanks, Josh. Let me just start by giving a bit of an overview of the trip and the current expected schedule. And let me just begin by saying also that we see this trip as really bringing together a number of the President's top priorities really for the last seven and a half years.\nFirst of all, there will be a significant focus, particularly on the front end of the trip, on the efforts that we've been engaged in to confront climate change. There will also be a significant focus on the global economy through the G20. And then, of course, this is the President's 10th trip to the Asia Pacific region, and the rebalance of the Asia Pacific has been a centerpiece of our foreign policy. And the trip will give him an opportunity to once again make the case for America's focus on the Asia Pacific, to make the case for TPP as a centerpiece of our economic and strategic leadership in the region, and to address some of the very pressing issues that are going to be on the agenda. The summit is including maritime issues and the South China Sea.\nSo, again, I think three big pieces of the presidency are going to be front and center here through climate change, the global economy and the Asia Pacific region. And I think the schedule will illustrate that.\nBrian will give you greater detail on the energy and climate events. As you know, we'll be departing on Wednesday morning and he'll have an initial stop in Nevada, where he will be speaking at the annual Lake Tahoe Summit with Senator Harry Reid there. And then that evening in Hawaii he will address leaders from the Pacific Island Conference of Leaders and the IUCN World Conservation Congress. And this is the first time that the United States has hosted the World Conservation Congress -- an important opportunity to bring together not just Pacific island leaders who have been a motivating factor around the urgency of action against climate change, but also conservation advocates from around the world. And Brian will speak in greater detail to his plans there.\nThursday, he will travel to Midway, where he will be able to speak to the latest marine national monument that I will leave it to Brian to pronounce and describe to you, but I think we will be bringing together through these three events both our domestic and international climate efforts and conservation efforts. The United States has been leading at home and we've been leading around the world in the pursuit of global action against climate change.\nFollowing the trip to Midway, he will depart on the morning of September 2nd for China. And then that afternoon and evening in China, he will be engaged in the bilateral program with President Xi Jinping. And this will be on Saturday, September 3rd, China time, because we will skip forward by a day. And we expect that he'll have both an extensive bilateral meeting, and then be hosted for a small dinner by President Xi Jinping as has been practiced at their previous meetings. And this will build on the work that we've done in our previous travel to Beijing, which included the historic breakthrough announcement on cooperation on climate change and also the engagements we've had here in Washington and Sunnylands with President Xi Jinping.\nI think we'll be reviewing all of the issues that have been front and center in the U.S.-China relationship for the last seven and a half years. On the positive side, we'll be able to review the progress we've made on the global economy, on climate change, our shared efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons through the Iran deal, our shared concern about the situation on the Korean Peninsula.\nOf course, we'll also be addressing differences, as we always do with China, whether it relates to cyber issues, some of the economic practices that we have raised concerns about, some of the tensions around maritime issues in the South China Sea and, of course, our longstanding differences on human rights as well. But, again, I think this is going to be the last occasion of this sort for the President to spend several hours with his Chinese counterpart and to review the state of U.S.-China relations and to try to see where we can make progress, and working together on areas of common interest or bridging some of the differences that have been characteristic of the relationship. So that will be the program for Saturday, September 3rd.\nThen, on the morning of Sunday, September 4th, in advance of the G20 Summit, we expect that the President will be able to have some bilateral meetings. We certainly anticipate that one of those will be with President Erdogan of Turkey. President Obama will want to discuss obviously the circumstances in Turkey since the attempted coup, as well as our counter-ISIL campaign and our efforts to promote greater stability in Syria and to respond to the refugee crisis. We anticipate there will be additional bilateral meetings and we'll keep you posted as they are scheduled.\nThen the President will move into the G20 schedule, and I'll leave it to Wally to review the sessions and the agenda. That begins, again, on the afternoon of Sunday the 4th, and continues throughout the day on Monday the 5th. And it will conclude the President's time in China with his press conference at the end of the G20. And, again, we'll keep you updated on any additional bilateral meetings that are scheduled.\nOn the evening of Monday, September 5th, the President will fly to Laos. A few words about the program in Laos. First of all, this is the first-ever U.S. presidential visit to Laos. It's a truly historic event for U.S.-Lao relationships and for the people and country of Laos. We obviously have a very difficult history with Laos, but given our increased focus on the Asia Pacific, given our attendance at the ASEAN and East Asia Summit meetings and also given this President's commitment to reach out to countries with whom we've had complicated histories, we see this as a real opportunity to advance the U.S.-Laos relationship, to begin to build a real working partnership that can benefit both of our peoples. And, again, I think the President's program in Laos will demonstrate that.\nWe will begin on Tuesday, September 6th, with the bilateral program with the President of Laos. We also anticipate President Obama will have an opportunity to interact with the Prime Minister of Laos as well. Laos has recently gone through a leadership transition, but President Obama has been able to engage both of those leaders through his ASEAN meetings in the past.\nAgain, I think the agenda with Laos will seek to identify areas where we can cooperate and we have an increasing development relationship focused on education and health and human capital; an increasing trade and investment relationship. We also have the substantial effort that we are ramping up to address the legacy of war in Laos. For our part, we have been steadily increasing our commitment to clearing unexploded ordnance in Laos, which has caused significant human suffering and been an impediment to development since the conclusion of the Vietnam War. We've been spending additional resources each year as it relates to clearing unexploded ordnance, and we anticipate the President will make this a focus of his visit.\nWe also have a POW/MIA recovery effort in Laos that we're committed to continuing to pursue and, if necessary, take additional steps to ensure that we're doing everything we can to recover those who have been lost.\nAfter his bilateral program, the President will give a speech that we anticipate to be an opportunity for him to step back and review his Asia policy over the course of the last seven years. I'll think he'll talk about how far we've come in shaping an architecture in the Asia Pacific for the United States to lead and to be at the table in forums like ASEAN and the East Asia Summit. I think he'll speak to the fact that we've significantly upgraded our commercial and economic diplomacy in the region, our security presence in the partnerships that we're building, both with allies but also with emerging partners on issues like maritime security and disaster response. I think you'll hear the President give a forceful case for TPP and why it is essential to American economic and security interests for Congress to move forward with approval of TPP.\nAgain, in this part of the world, which is the largest emerging market in the world, TPP is seen as a litmus test for U.S. leadership. TPP allows us to establish the rules of the road for trade and commerce. It's also seen as a demonstration of America's commitment to be a Pacific power. And we would be stepping back from that leadership role. We would be ceding the region to countries like China, who do not set the same types of high standards for trade agreements, were we to not follow through with TPP. So at each of his stops, including in this speech, I think you'll see the President make the case for TPP.\nHe'll also have an opportunity to address both the enormous potential in the region for greater connectivity economically, for greater cooperation, and also some of the areas of recent difference, including the South China Sea and our approach to maritime issues.\nSo following the speech, we anticipate the President will have time for a bilateral meeting with President Duterte of the Philippines. The Philippines is obviously a treaty ally of the United States, a party to the recent arbitral ruling in the South China Sea. I think we'll want to review the state of play as it relates to our treaty lines and the situation in the South China Sea in that dialogue with the new President of the Philippines.\nOne Wednesday, September 7th, we anticipate the President will have an event devoted to unexploded ordnance, where he'll be able to discuss our efforts to support the people of Laos as they seek to clear unexploded ordnance, and have an opportunity to interact with some of the workers and survivors who have confronted this issue.\nAnd then the President will travel to Luang Prabang, which is a cultural capital of Laos, an historical capital of Laos, where he'll have an opportunity to do a town hall meeting with some of our Southeast Asian Leaders. For those of you who have traveled with us, you know that the YSEALI Initiative, like our African Leaders Initiative, has generated enormous enthusiasm in Southeast Asia. It's something the President is committed to, and he'll have an opportunity for a town hall. And we anticipate he'll have some cultural stops in Luang Prabang, as well. Then, that night is the gala dinner kicking off the ASEAN and East Asia summits hosted back in Vientiane.\nThen, on Thursday, September 8th, he will have the U.S.-ASEAN meeting and then the East Asia Summit. And again, we anticipate the potential for an additional bilateral meeting. And we'll keep you updated as we have any additions to the schedule.\nSo again, I will stop there, and we can deal with some of the specific issues at each of the stops in questions. But let me turn it over to Brian to give you an overview of the climate and energy event.\nMR. DEESE: Thanks, Ben. And I will just touch on some of the climate-related issues, both domestically and internationally -- it's been a busy period over the last several days -- that provide context for this upcoming trip.\nFirst, on the climate side, for those of you who are not breathlessly following the most recent data that has come out, I would note that just recent data that we've seen suggests that -- or finds that for the first half of 2016, energy sector emissions in the United States are actually down -- down 6 percent from last year, and 15 percent from 2005. And they're at their lowest level in nearly 20 years. So while there's been a lot of focus on the heat and the temperature increases in 2016, the President will enter this trip in a situation where we've seen emissions fall to their lowest level in 20 years while we've seen growth in the United States outpace most other advanced economies.\nOn the conservation side, as all of you probably saw, last week the President designated two national monuments -- the first in Maine and the second around the remote Pacific Hawaiian Islands -- both of which will be focuses as we go on to this trip.\nSo just to speak in a little bit more detail -- on the first stop of this trip, as Ben noted, the President will be delivering remarks at the 20th Annual Lake Tahoe Summit. He'll be joining Senator Reid there. This is a summit that for the past two decades has brought together federal, state and local leaders, all dedicated to restoring and sustaining Lake Tahoe, which is one of our most important environmental treasures, but also important economic driver for the region and the states in that part of the country.\nThe President's remarks will focus on the link between conservation and climate change, and trying to help explain and make the case why the types of actions that he's taken recently are part of his broader effort to combat climate change. And in that context, we'll also announce a series of steps that the administration is taking and will take to boost clean energy in the region and the American West, and also to address some of the ongoing climate-related threats that the West is experiencing, including drought and wildfire.\nThe evening, as Ben noted, the President will travel to Honolulu. And there, he will have an opportunity to speak to a number of heads of states of Pacific islands. A number of these leaders are leaders that the President had an opportunity to meet with last year in Paris. One of the most significant meetings that the President took when he traveled to Paris on the front end of the COP was with a number of these Pacific island leaders to underscore the importance of their role in the global climate change effort, and to talk very pragmatically about how to address issues that they face more front and center than any other country. So the President is looking forward to having another opportunity to interact with and speak directly to those leaders.\nIt's also on the eve of the World Conservation Congress. And as Ben noted, this is the first time that the United States is hosting the WCC. And so, for those of you who don't know, the World Conservation Congress brings together approximately 8,000 delegates from 184 countries, and the delegates represent business, government, science, youth groups, indigenous peoples' organizations, NGOs, a whole range of actors who are committed to conservation. And again, in this context, the President will be discussing the role that remote islands play in the climate context, but also the importance of the intersection between conservation and climate change as we face an increasingly severe threat of climate change in these parts of the world.\nThe following day, the President will travel to Midway, as Ben noted. And Midway is within the Papah?naumoku?kea National Monument. This is the monument that the President expanded last week. With the expansion, the total protected area is now 582,578 square miles. That makes it the largest marine protected area in the world, and the President is looking forward to having an opportunity to learn more directly about this marine area by traveling directly there. We anticipate that he will have an opportunity both to get a more detailed briefing from the experts there on Midway about the marine environment, and also be able to interact directly with the wildlife and the other attributes of the island.\nThe expansion of the Papah?naumoku?kea monument is an incredibly significant action. It provides protections for more than 7,000 marine species, including whales and sea turtles that are currently listed under the Endangered Species Act, and also the longest-living marine species in the world, which is black coral, which have been found to live longer than 4,500 years. A lot of this area reflects marine environments that we are only beginning to fully learn about, and also learn about the impact of climate change and changing ocean patterns on this part of the world.\nI would note that as part of the way in which the President approaches national monument designations under the Antiquities Act, we have prioritized community input and the importance of native management in the expansion of this monument. And so in that context, Hawaii's Department of Natural Resources and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs will actually play a greater management role going forward as trustees in the national marine monument.\nSo then just to talk a little bit about the China portion of this trip as well, because in that context climate will be one of a number of significant issues that the leaders will discuss -- just for a little bit of context, the relationship between the United States and China on climate change has been one of the most significant drivers of global action over the last several years. As Ben alluded to, and as many of you know, that was most notably punctuated by the historic joint announcement in November of 2014, when President Obama and President Xi jointly set climate targets for their respective countries and demonstrated that after years and decades in which China and the United States appeared to be on opposing teams in a climate negotiation, that both the U.S. and China could demonstrate leadership. And that helped unlock an intense but deliberate diplomatic effort to try to encourage other countries around the world to do the same.\nThe U.S.-China climate interaction has built from there. Last September, the U.S. and China put out another joint climate statement which laid out a roadmap for the Paris climate agreement, as well as demonstrating additional domestic action that both our countries were taking. That roadmap, announced a couple of months in advance of the Paris agreement last year, was an integral component of laying the groundwork for how we ultimately got to a Paris agreement. And I remember -- I recall discussing with some of you at the time about how this roadmap would indeed be significant, because it wasn't clear what the Paris agreement would look like at that time. But if you go back now and you look at the shared vision that President Obama and President Xi put forward in September, you can see in that the seeds of how the Paris agreement itself actually came together.\nAnd again, earlier this year in March, the presidents came together and marked important progress on climate once again, with both countries announcing that they would seek to formally join the Paris agreement in 2016. That announcement helped to encourage an effort that we have been working on since to try to get the Paris agreement to formally enter into force as early as possible and, hopefully, in 2016.\nSo we have now developed quite a significant record of working collaboratively with the Chinese on climate change. And I anticipate that we will be able to once again demonstrate our two countries working together on this issue when the Presidents meet in China. I had an opportunity to travel there last week to discuss these issues with my counterparts, and I anticipate that when the presidents meet, they will discuss topics that will include this issue of trying to get the Paris agreement to enter into force as quickly as possible. As many of you know that for the Paris agreement to formally enter into force, 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions must formally join. Together, the United States and China represent just under 40 percent of global emissions. So the act of our two countries joining, as and when that happens, will help move us closer to that goal.\nI also expect we will cover other topics and that the Presidents will have an opportunity to discuss important multilateral negotiations in the climate space that are going on outside of Paris. Notably, even before the historic November, 2014 joint statement, the Sunnylands interaction between President Obama and President Xi was the first time that they publically indicated their interest in working together on climate issues. And in that context, the issue was on hydrofluorocarbons -- HFCs -- in which in 2013, President Obama and President Xi committed to trying to work to find an international, multilateral mechanism to phase out the use of HFCs. Now, we are only about a month or six weeks away from a significant final negotiation -- international negotiation of HFCs, so I anticipate that that will be an important part of the interaction between the two leaders.\nAnd likewise, there is an important multilateral negotiation in progress now on curbing emissions from the global airline industry. And aviation is an important sector with respect to carbon emissions, so I anticipate that likewise our countries will share views about how to find a solution to these issues as well. And as we have in other areas, our hope will be that we can demonstrate that by the United States and China moving together and jointly demonstrating our willingness to take on issues, we can help encourage greater ambition and greater action at the global level as well.\nSo with that, let me turn it over to Wally to talk about some of the national economic issues at play.\nMR. ADEYEMO: Thanks, Brian. As you all know, this will be the President's 10th and final G20 meeting. And I think in order to understand what we're going to accomplish at this G20, it's important to go back to the President's first G20 meeting, which occurred in April of 2009.\nAt that point, the U.S. economy was shedding 800,000 jobs. The G20 responded to the global economic crisis by committing to provide trillions of dollars of stimulus and also by empowering the international financial institutions by providing them with a trillion dollars of additional revenue. This helped create the atmosphere for growth and now on the eve of the President's final G20 Summit, the U.S. economy has added nearly 15 million jobs, starting in early 2010. And despite the need for additional global demand, we've seen the global economy grow by over 25 percent since the depth of the global financial and economic crisis.\nIn addition to a debate over how to grow the economy coming out of the crisis -- which was resolved by additional stimulus by countries -- there's been an ongoing debate that you're all aware of, of what we do in terms of stimulus versus austerity that has been going on at the G20 for a long time. The debate was largely about whether you can cut to growth, which some advocated, and the President advocated an approach of investing to grow the economy by using additional fiscal resources to grow economies.\nThe data has proven that the President's approach actually worked. You look at job creation in the United States and you look at growth in the United States -- it far exceeds growth and job creation in a number of advanced economies due to the policies the President put in place. Imitation -- in looking at other economies, you look at places like Canada, Japan and China, which only in 2015 have also taken steps to stimulate their economy using additional fiscal measures. And when you look around the table at the G20, a number of G20 countries have also used fiscal stimulus in the last few years.\nOf course, we want them to do more because we think the global economy needs to grow more, but we think that the debate over austerity and stimulus has largely been settled in the favor of additional stimulus. And we think that countries should use all three tools -- fiscal policy, monetary policy, and structural reform to advance the global growth agenda that is critical to creating jobs and also to creating opportunities for American workers.\nThe President's final summit will provide an opportunity for leaders to continue addressing how to boost global growth while we also ensure that the benefits of globalization, digitization, integration are shared more broadly. On this year's agenda will be important issues such as reducing global excess capacity of steel, advancing the WTO Environmental Goods Agreement that eliminates trade barriers for a variety of green products, better preparing the international financial institutions to address the challenges associated with the global migration crisis, and advancing our shared climate and development agenda.\nThis year's G20 Leaders Summit will provide a chance to affirm the G20's commitments to upholding high standards, protecting workers, ensuring a level playing field, and expanding opportunity. In addition to the summit, top of mind for many of the countries sitting there will be TPP, which we see as essential to both our economic opportunity in our country but also to our national security priorities. A number of G20 countries are members of TPP and this will provide the President an opportunity to see them and to discuss how we advance that shared agenda of creating a rules-based order in the Asia Pacific that provides real opportunities to level the playing field for our workers and our firms. We look forward to a successful summit.\nAnd I'll turn it over to Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, gentlemen. So with that, I think most of these guys can stick around for another 10 or 15 minutes at least and take a few questions.\nSo, Josh, do you want to get us started here?\nQ: Great. Thanks, Josh. Ben, I wanted to ask you about the bilateral with Erdogan that you mentioned. What will be the President's message to Erdogan about their incursion into Syria? And it seems like two of our partners now, Turkey and YPG, are basically in open combat with each other. So what are we doing about that? And given remarks recently from the Vice President, Kerry and others, is it fair to say we're kind of taking Turkey's side on that one? And then, Brian, if you could just confirm that the U.S. and China will join the Paris agreement during the President's trip to China.\nMR. RHODES: Well, first of all, I think, Josh, broadly, they'll be discussing the counter-ISIL campaign and the fact that we need to stay united in our efforts to defeat ISIL. That is a shared priority of the U.S. and Turkey and our whole coalition. We're actively working -- the specific question now related to Jarabulus. What I'd say is that the United States offered support and has supported the Turkish effort to clear Jarabulus of ISIL fighters and we also would support Turkey's efforts to secure its border.\nWe do not support and we would oppose efforts to move south and engage in activities against the Syrian Democratic Forces, the SDF opposition that we have supported. So I think our message to Turkey has been clear that we support the objectives laid out to clear Jarabulus of ISIL fighters -- that's something we've talked to Turkey about for some time -- and to provide space for them to secure their border.\nFurther action against the SDF would complicate efforts to have that united front against ISIL that we want. At the same time, we've communicated to the SDF that they should not be engaged in military activity against Turkish forces and, again, they have a commitment to retrograde east of the Euphrates River, as well. So what we will be actively working with our partners on in the coming days is, again, support for the objectives laid out by Turkey to secure and clear Jarabulus of ISIL fighters, provide that space and security on its border, but at the same time to not have members of our coalition engage with one another. We have enough work to do together to confront and combat ISIL.\nIn terms of the broader U.S.-Turkish relationship, we expressed our solidarity for Turkey in the face of an attempted coup and our condolences for the enormous loss of life in that attempted coup. They are a NATO ally, they have our strong support for their own security. And President Obama, like Vice President Biden, Secretary Kerry, has engaged President Erdogan regularly. He'll be able to carry forward those conversations, both about what's been happening in Turkey, also about what's been happening in the region. So we have a broad and active agenda.\nMR. DEESE: And with respect to your question, I do anticipate that the issue of implementation of the Paris agreement will be a topic of discussion, but I don't have any announcements with respect to specific actions by either country.\nQ: I guess either for Wally or Ben -- you've both made the point that TPP is the centerpiece of the President's agenda in Asia, and he's going to make a big point of emphasizing that. But we've got two presidential candidates who are against it, you have congressional leaders saying it's not going to come up for a vote. How conceivably can he make a positive case for TPP in the current environment? That's the first question.\nAnd then the second question is, the bilateral with the President of the Philippines, this is a gentleman who's made some fairly inflammatory remarks about treatment of women, journalists, others. Do you expect the President to raise concerns about those issues, given the long history of friendship between these two countries?\nMR. RHODES: So on your second question, we absolutely expect that the President will raise concerns about some of the recent statements from the President of the Philippines. We regularly meet with the leaders of our treaty allies where we have differences, whether it relates to human rights practices or derogatory comments. We take the opportunity of those meetings to raise those issues directly.\nI think at the same time, of course, we have a very sensitive security environment in the region right now. And in the aftermath of the arbitration ruling, it's essential that, just as we will be talking to China about matters related to the South China Sea, that we're also talking to ASEAN countries and treaty allies like the Philippines, as well.\nSo I think that discussion will encompass both concerns about statements that have been made by the President of the Philippines and our commitment to supporting human rights and all efforts that are undertaken bilaterally, and also, again, discussing the regional picture, particularly I think with a focus on the maritime issues.\nOn TPP, I'd just say a couple of things. First of all, we have been, in a very multifaceted way, expanding U.S. presence in the Asia Pacific because this is the largest emerging region in the world. It's essential to our economic growth, it's essential to our security interests, it's essential to our ability to stand up for our values in the world. And I think one of the points that we're going to make is this is not simply about TPP; obviously, we've done a lot to expand our security posture, to strengthen our Northeast Asian alliances, to build partnerships in the maritime and disaster-response space across Southeast Asia, to support a democratic transition in a country like Myanmar. There are many elements to our Asia Pacific strategy.\nBut TPP is, in many ways, seen as a litmus test for whether or not the U.S. has staying power in this region. We are a Pacific power, and we have been traditionally, but we're also on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. And what the countries of the Asia Pacific region want to know, particularly the Asian countries, is whether or not we can be counted on. And when they see an agreement like TPP that has enormous benefits for the United States; that, frankly, brings other countries up to standards set by the United States; that has a country like Vietnam endorsing, for the first time, through a legal process, the right of workers to organize; or has a country like Malaysia undertaking significant reforms to its economy and providing for greater protections against child labor and trafficking; or that has many different countries opening their markets to U.S. goods -- when they see such an evidently good deal for the United States, and then see the United States not following through on that, it will cause them to question our leadership in the Asia Pacific and our leadership in the world. And that is profoundly important economically to the United States because we need access to these markets, but it's also important to our national security, because it would be seen as a significant setback I think for American leadership if we don't move forward.\nI won't speak to the domestic issues beyond saying that many of the questions that have been raised about trade agreements for many years are actually specifically addressed in TPP. So some of the things that we heard about the shortcomings of NAFTA that the President agrees with were actually addressed in the negotiation of TPP. That's why you have these unprecedented labor and environmental standards. That's why you have significant market access.\nThis is a trade agreement that is not simply about, again, undertaking steps to lower prices, it's about being able to create jobs here and export more goods to the largest emerging market in the world.\nSo I think he'll make the case that this is in the best interest of the United States. There's always difficult concerns raised around trade, but I think his point has consistently been that TPP actually addresses those issues and that it's a matter of both our economic security and well-being, and also a matter of our national security that we stick with the effort to approve TPP.\nMR. EARNEST: I think the only thing I would add, just in terms of the politics, Mark -- and I'm sure this is, to the extent that the President's interlocutors at these meetings are sophisticated consumers of political information about the United States -- the President has a strong case to make about the strong bipartisan support for these trade agreements inside the United States. And there was a recent poll that was conducted by your colleagues at NBC that indicated there was majority support across the country both among Democrats and Republicans for the trade agreement that this administration has negotiated.\nAnd I think there is a reservoir of support across the country that we can draw from, but there has long been historic opposition to these kind of trade agreements, certainly from the Democratic Party, but among some elements from the Republican Party, too. And so the President is going to make a strong case that we have made progress, and that there is a path for us to get this done before the President leaves office.\nMichelle.\nQ: In these conversations with China, about how much of that discussion -- I know there's a lot on the table here -- but how much of that will be on the North Korea threat? How do you think China has been doing in pressuring North Korea? Where is that pressure visible? And how much do you think the THAAD system is an obstacle in how China is going to address this with the United States?\nMR. RHODES: So we think that the Chinese have, over the course of the last several years, particularly since Kim Jong-un assumed power in North Korea, they have worked with us to apply additional political and economic pressure. The sanctions that were passed through the U.N. Security Council several months ago were the strongest sanctions that have ever been put in place. Chinese support for the implementation of those sanctions will be essential, and we continue to discuss that with them. The recent statement out of the U.N. Security Council on their missile launches was another indication of North Korea's isolation.\nBut at the same time, clearly there needs to be more pressure applied. I think our main principles are we are open to dialogue to resolve this issue, but only if North Korea demonstrates it's serious about denuclearization; if they continue on the current course of provocation that they're on, that we would want to see full implementation of those sanctions without fail; and that we would want to see a clear signal, each time there is one of these provocations, of consequences from the international community -- whether that be through political and diplomatic pressure, or, when necessary, the application of economic pressure. I think China has raised these concerns about the THAAD system. Our point to China has been: This in no way is directed at China, it's directed at the threat from North Korea. And so long as North Korea is developing ballistic missile capabilities and moving forward with its nuclear program, we have an obligation, a responsibility for our own security and the security of our allies in Japan and the Republic of Korea to take steps to counter that threat.\nAnd so China has expressed these concerns. But again, first of all, the most important thing that could be done is to continue to apply pressure on the North Koreans to change course. Absent that taking place, we are not going to skirt our responsibility to defend ourselves and our allies.\nMR. EARNEST: Margaret.\nQ: Ben, do you expect President Obama to meet in any form -- bilat or otherwise -- with Vladimir Putin? And I think it's like a year now since the Russian incursion. Does the President view this as a sort of last chance to broker anything on Syria? Or how is he approaching that meeting? Is there anything you can tell us about Iran deploying these missiles around Fordow?\nMR. RHODES: With respect to President Putin, we don't have a bilateral meeting scheduled. However, it has been the case that at each of these summits that they both attend, we usually try to find an opportunity for the two leaders to spend some time together, usually to focus on Syria and Ukraine. So I don't know that they'll have a full formal bilateral meeting, but I expect that they'll have an opportunity to speak on the margins of the G20.\nWith respect to Russia and Syria, Secretary Kerry recently, on Friday, had another round of discussions with Foreign Minister Lavrov. We did not reach an agreement, although progress was made. We are focused right now on getting Russian support and Russian action through its own military and through its influence on the Assad regime for there to be a true cessation of hostilities and a mechanism to get humanitarian assistance into affected areas, particularly in Aleppo. So we're going to continue discussions to see if we can accomplish that objective. As you know, we've always seen that to be an essential precursor to more effective political discussions.\nI think the message to the Russians does have to be that there's a window closing here, and we need to see that they can reach a real agreement and that they can back it up. And so even if we are able to get an agreement, that's only going to happen if we are assured that it's going to provide the necessary humanitarian access into Aleppo. And then we're going to want to make sure that there's follow-through in terms of the pause that is necessary to allow that to go forward and in terms of our ability to assess whether or not we can move forward with additional cooperation with Russia to go after not just ISIL, but al Nusra Front.\nSo I think this is a critical time. In the coming days, we'll have an opportunity to see whether the Russians can get to the agreement that meets those requirements. And I think internationally, the enormous concern over the situation in Aleppo in particular I think makes it imperative that Russia take those steps. And it's not just us -- I think Russia will hear from other leaders at the G20, the U.N. General Assembly, that its intervention in Syria has in many ways exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo and that we want to see, therefore, actions that can save lives and create some opening for a political resolution.\nYour other question was Fordow? Look, the S-300 system, this is something that the Russians helpfully delayed transfer for many years as we were negotiating the nuclear deal. Our strong preference expressed to them continually is to not deliver this type of system to the Iranians. That's something Secretary Kerry has expressed. They did move forward with it. It's not prohibited under any U.N. Security Council resolution because it's a defensive system. So even, for instance, the arms embargo that had been in place under the previous regime would not have been applied to the S-300 system because it's a defensive system. That doesn't mean we don't have concerns with any increased Iranian military capability, and we've expressed those concerns.\nWith respect to Fordow, our main focus there is that the Iranians are keeping their commitments under the nuclear deal. They have ceased all enrichment at Fordow. Fordow is under very extensive IAEA monitoring. So we're principally focused on their fulfilling their JCPOA commitments there, which involves no enrichment; centrifuges that have been, in many cases, removed and put under monitoring and storage; and also the regular, ongoing access that IAEA inspectors have to the facility.\nQ: So are you concerned about the missiles being at Fordow? Or was the concern about the S-300 transfer?\nMR. RHODES: I think the concern is about the -- that we've expressed for years was about the upgrade in Iranian capability in this space. So that's a concern that we had already expressed. And again, it's a defensive system. But its sophistication raised those concerns for us, and I know for some of our allies and partners in the region.\nAgain, with respect to Fordow, if they're not enriching there, that addresses that immediate concern that it not be used as a facility where they can advance their nuclear capability.\nMR. EARNEST: Ron.\nQ: Just on climate and the environment, I'm trying to understand exactly how the United States intends to ratify the Paris agreement. Because I believe it's your position that it's not a treaty, it's an agreement, so this can be done through executive action of some sort. And more broadly, with the stops in Midway and Tahoe next week, can you more broadly explain what you think the President's legacy should be, how we should think of it in this area of climate and environment, and what he has done?\nMR. DEESE: Sure. Well, on the first issue, the Paris agreement is an executive agreement. And so the President will use his authority that has been used in dozens of executive agreements in the past to join and formally deposit our instrument of acceptance and therefore put our country as a party to the Paris agreement. That's a process that is quite well-established in our existing legal system. In the context of international agreements and international arrangements, there is a category of them that are treaties that require advice and consent from the Senate. But there's a broad category of executive agreements where the executive can enter into those agreements without that advice and consent.\nQ: And when is that going to happen?\nMR. DEESE: Well, we have made the commitment that we will join in 2016, and we have made the commitment to do that as soon as possible this year. So with respect to exactly when, I don't have any announcements on that front, but we have committed and we have been working on that issue.\nQ: Is there some legal process? I don't understand why it hasn't been done and what's delaying it.\nMR. DEESE: Well, there's a whole process of how the U.S. enters into executive agreements, which involves a legal component, a legal analysis of the agreement, as well as a review by executive branch agencies and otherwise. That's a process that has been underway since the Paris agreement. And again, we've made a commitment that we will get that done this year and that we're working to get it done as soon as possible.\nWith respect to your broader question and climate more broadly, I guess I would say two things. The first, the question of legacy I'll leave aside and leave to other people. But I think there's two things about this trip in particular that I think are notable. The first is that this President views conservation activities as an important component to an overall approach to climate change, and that particularly when you look at what's happening in our country right now -- whether it's floods in the Southeast or fires in the American West, droughts and water issues increasingly emerging in various parts of our country -- it's impossible to escape the fact that in the 21st century the questions about conservation, conserving land and water resources, will need to be done with a view toward both addressing climate change, but also with a view toward adapting to the impacts of climate change that are already being felt by communities across the country.\nAnd so that has affected the way that the President has gone about conservation. It's affected the priority that he's put on conservation. And so these last two monument designations that he took this past week are significant, but he's not coming new to this issue. And, in fact, the President has been implementing a comprehensive conservation agenda for the last several years. And that has included the use of the Antiquities Act and monument designation, but it's included doing so in a way that increasingly links this issue with climate change.\nI think that the President's stop in Tahoe, as well as his stop in Hawaii, will both accentuate that in pretty stark terms because of the challenges that the Tahoe region and the West more generally are facing associated with climate impacts, and also because of both the astounding natural wonder of Papah?naumoku?kea, but also the incredible threats that our ocean faces as a result of climate change.\nI think the second significant thing about the President's approach to climate change is seen in his engagement with China. And the President recognized early on in the administration that if we were going to have an effective global response to climate change, we were going to have to write a new playbook; that the old approaches had not succeeded and, in fact, the Copenhagen conference in 2009 was a poignant moment where it was clear that the world was not going to come together under an old framework where developed countries were put on one side of the field and developing countries were put on the other side, and developed countries alone were asked to take action.\nIf we fast-forward now to the fact that we have a Paris agreement and that the global community's approach to climate change has fundamentally changed, that process didn't happen by accident and it didn't happen overnight. It was the result of a very consistent and steady diplomatic effort that the President prioritized year after year, working to restore U.S. credibility on climate issues through our Climate Action Plan, demonstrating to the world that we actually could make progress in reducing emissions.\nAnd as I mentioned at the top, CO2 emissions in the United States are falling, and falling increasingly rapidly, which is something that analysts even only a couple of years ago wouldn't have projected. But then taking that credibility and applying it internationally to try to forge new coalitions, the partnership with China was significant but it's only one of the places where the President has prioritized that. You saw him over the course of the last several years use diplomatic engagements with countries like India and Brazil in the North American continent just recently announcing a North American-wide goal of using 50 percent clean energy and building a North American strategy toward this issue.\nThe President understood that in each of his engagements, he was going to need to personally and directly prioritize this issue in building this new consensus. So I think one of the -- this I think is an example of the way that the President approaches diplomacy in international challenges where you need to identify a strategy that will work, but also be steady and persistent and patient in trying to get to those ultimate objectives.\nWe have a lot of ways to go -- more to do, including these multilateral negotiations on HFCs and aircraft emissions that are alive right now and that we'll resolve later this fall. So the President is also going to look forward and try to figure out how he can build on the progress we've made to get successful resolution over the course of the fall as well.\nMR. EARNEST: Roberta.\nQ: Thanks. About a year ago I think President Obama and President Xi agreed to step up work on the Bilateral Investment Treaty, and I'm wondering how much progress has been made on that point. And are you looking for a breakthrough, or, conversely, can you describe some of the real sticking points that remain?\nMR. ADEYEMO: So we continue to work with China on the Bilateral Investment Treaty and on our trade and investment relationship at large. That work has led to making progress in meaningful ways. I think that when you look at the overarching relationship between the U.S. and China, you need to look back to the beginning of the President's term. And we've made a great deal of progress on issues including the exchange rate, on trade and investment issues, and also on issues, as Brian said, related to climate agreements and development. That has been possible through the President's engagement with President Xi, and also the engagement of various Cabinet Secretaries with their counterparts in China. Ambassador Froman and Secretary Kerry continue to negotiate the Bilateral Investment Treaty -- we're hoping to continue to make progress with the Chinese on this issue. It's an issue that the President has discussed with President Xi during their last meeting in March, and they'll also discuss during the meeting that they will have before the G20.\nOur goal, of course, in the Bilateral Investment Treaty, is to open up markets for American firms and workers in China but to also encourage China to push forward with the reforms that President Xi has announced. And in doing that, it will create a market-determined -- it will help us with our push to have them have a more market-determined exchange rate and open markets to U.S. firms, but also will create opportunities for Chinese firms as well. So our hope is that by the time we have the meeting with President Xi, President Obama and he will be able to talk about our next steps in moving towards the completion of the Bilateral Investment Treaty.\nMR. EARNEST: George, I'm going to give you the last one for these guys and then we'll have them go.\nQ: Ben, you mentioned the importance of the pivot to Asia. This trip and the APEC Summit are the last chances to lock that in. Do you have any confidence that the pivot will endure past January 20th? And if so, why?\nMR. RHODES: We do, principally because I think anybody who is looking objectively at the world and prioritizing where we're going to spend our diplomatic resources, our military resources would determine that the largest emerging region in the world merits our attention. I think we've tried to make progress in a number of areas -- one is just simply on shaping the architecture for how the region operates.\nSo when we came into office, the United States was not really at the table on a lot of the discussions about how countries were going to engage multilaterally. To use an analogy, the Atlantic community has NATO, it has the U.S.-EU relationship, it has a whole host of multilateral organizations. There were not similar structures for dialogue in the Asia Pacific.\nOne of the things that we've done is attend every year at the head-of-state level the U.S.-ASEAN Summits, and then also help to shape the East Asia Summit process, which brings the ASEAN countries together with the other big players in the region like the United States, China, India, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Russia. Now, we think that we've established the predicate that the U.S. is going to be at the table on those discussions and that we're going to work through ASEAN and the East Asia Summit to address the full range of political and economic questions in the region. And our expectation is that the next President would carry forward that head-of-state engagement. So structurally, that's one big difference.\nSecond, on a military and security side, in our defense budget review during this administration, we prioritized the Asia rebalance. So it is an area where we protected investments in our defense budget, and we've dedicated those to strengthening our alliances. And we've taken steps to modernize those alliances, whether we're talking about some of the shared capabilities we've developed with Japan and the Republic of Korea, the rotational Marine deployment through Australia, the access agreement we have with the Philippines as it relates to their base, but also we've developed increasing partnerships with Southeast Asian militaries, and we have a maritime security initiative to strengthen capacity on maritime security. And we've been the largest supporter of disaster response. So I think the U.S. military is postured in a way in which we're going to be able to be present and to meet the challenges of the 20th century in this part of the world.\nNow, one of the tensions, of course, has been on the South China Sea, on maritime security. In addition to the maritime security initiative that I mentioned, the President has worked with his team to ensure that we have a game plan that includes commitment to principles of freedom of navigation. And the type of freedom of navigation operations that we see, we think it's the type of thing that will carry forward, given that the South China Sea is an area that has a trillion dollars of commerce flowing through it.\nAt the same time, some of the diplomatic efforts that we've had to support international law, to support steps like the arbitral ruling that's taken place, and the support and the negotiation of a code of conduct between ASEAN and China -- we'd like to see those carried forward, because the world has an enormous interest in there not being a conflict in the South China Sea and there being peaceful resolution of disputes under international law. So we think that that will carry forward.\nI've talked about TPP -- that really is the connective tissue and the glue to economic and commercial leadership. And it's something, as I said, that the region connects to other elements of U.S. leadership. At the same time, a lot of our export growth in the world has come from this region. And we've dedicated enormous resources from the Commerce Department, the State Department and others to advocate for U.S. businesses. And I think you're going to see that continue as well, because our business community tells us that this is an area of principal focus.\nAnd then lastly, we remain very committed to democracy and human rights. And shortly after the President's visit, for instance, he'll be hosting State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi here at the White House. The democratic transition in Myanmar has been another centerpiece of our engagement with Asia, supporting that process. And we've gone from a situation where Aung San Suu Kyi was in prison to a situation where she's going to be welcomed by the President of the United States as the leader of the government there as State Counselor. And so that's I think a nascent relationship we'd like to see develop.\nThe very last thing I'd just say is if you look at some of the President's travel this year, Vietnam has become one of our critical partners in that part of the world, across a host of fronts. And there are enormous strategic and economic reasons that that relationship will continue to grow. Laos is an emerging partner for the United States.\nSo again, in addition to our core alliances, I think people will look back and see this as a time, when you talk about a Vietnam or a Laos or a Myanmar, the United States was developing closer relations with countries that had traditionally been adversaries. I think there will be enormous incentives for the next administration to carry that forward.\nSo TPP remains the major question mark. I think the logic of it is overwhelming, that we'd be cutting against our interest to walk away from TPP. The next President will benefit enormously from having TPP. If you were taking office, you would be in a much stronger position if you had the United States having established that it will be setting the rules of the road through this multilateral trade agreement and will have sent a signal that we're present in the Asia-Pacific. That will be of enormous benefit, we believe, to the next administration.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, gentlemen. So I think you can tell that the President expects to cover a lot of ground on this trip, both based on the wide-ranging discussion that we've had and based on the fact that we anticipate two refueling stops on the flight back. So it should be a good one.\nQ: Is he giving a news conference at the Southeast Asia --\nMR. EARNEST: I do anticipate that the President will have an opportunity to take questions from all of you after the ASEAN Summit in Laos.\nWe'll just bounce around if that's all right. Olivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Ben mentioned that the S-300 deployment doesn't violate U.N. Security Council resolutions, but what about U.S. law? My understanding is that there are several U.S. laws that at least strongly suggest that that deployment is not legal. What is the administration's position on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Why don't I go and confirm this, but my understanding is that it does -- it's not -- it obviously is something that we are deeply concerned about. But much of the legal architecture that's in place is directly -- both at the U.N. and in the United States, frankly -- related to Iran's offensive military capabilities. And the system that they have purchased from the Russians, while we find it objectionable, is defensive in nature.\nQ: And on a much, much more lighthearted note -- you can't just dangle out there that the President is going to interact directly with wildlife and not expect a follow-up question. (Laughter.) So any details you could offer up on that particular exchange?\nMR. EARNEST: It will be a formal bilateral meeting. (Laughter.)\nQ: Well, it could be a pull-aside, I guess. But any additional details you could provide on that score would be --\nMR. EARNEST: We'll do our best to do that as the trip gets closer. So hopefully it will go swimmingly, though. (Laughter.)\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On climate change, can you describe the level of concern that the administration might have that whatever is accomplished at the G20 vis-а-vis the Paris accord will be diminished, if not disbanded, at some point in the future by a future presidency? The possibility of that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think Brian alluded to this a little bit earlier. But I think what is clear, Kevin, is that we have been able to work effectively with the Chinese to advance U.S. interests in a way that's consistent with the Chinese interests based on their own assessment, but also in a way that has really catalyzed action around the world. That's a good thing.\nAnd you'll recall, Kevin, that so much of the skepticism that was in place about U.S. efforts to take action on climate change was driven by our critics who said that China would never go along with it, and that for all the steps that we were taking to address climate change, that was being undermined by China's continued investment in fossil fuels.\nThat's no longer the case. The dynamic we have now is much different, where the United States and China are working together in, again, a way that advances our mutual interests to confront this problem. And that has prompted more people around the world to get engaged with this effort.\nSo what that means is that any effort to roll this back is going to isolate the United States of America on an issue that we have been leading on for decades. So I think what is emerging as a consensus is that because of the President's leadership, and because of this diplomatic strategy that we have implemented successfully, we've been able to advance our interests. And even a President in a different party would be reluctant to unravel that progress.\nQ: But critics said that this was sort of an \"end round\" Congress in sort of getting this done. A proponent, meanwhile, told me this morning, hey, that's just sour grapes. How do you see that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the way that the agreement is structured, the way that the agreement that was brokered in Paris is structured, essentially allows the President to use existing authority that Congress has already given the President to implement this agreement. So essentially, we are pursuing this agreement consistent with the way that Congress intended.\nQ: Last one. I want to ask you about -- something about hacking. We've been reporting today that there were two state election databases that had fallen, at least possibly, to theft of voter registration information. The FBI, you may recall, has actually warned that foreign hackers may have penetrated a couple of state election databases. I'm curious if you're aware of that, and if so, how serious are the breaches that have been reported. And does the White House have any evidence that the hackers that may have been involved in these breaches were the same hackers that were involved in the previous release of DNC and DCCC information?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I think much of this reporting has been based on the FBI's communications with the administrators of computer networks and other cybersecurity experts around the country.\nSo I'll leave it to the FBI to describe the nature of their conversations. What I can say more broadly for the administration is that there has been a discussion about whether or not to designate certain voting systems that are, of course, maintained at the state and local level as piece of critical infrastructure. And that would give the federal government and experts at the federal government more of a role in assisting the administrators of those networks as they deter intrusions.\nThat's something that's being discussed by senior members of the President's national security team. We certainly will continue to work in coordination with state and local officials, even short of that designation, to offer them advice and assistance at their request to ensure that they are protecting their systems. And I know that this is something that the Department of Homeland Security is taking the lead on. Secretary Johnson convened a conference call a couple of weeks ago with election officials across the country to discuss this issue. That wasn't the last conversation in this dialogue, but this is a conversation that will continue.\nQ: I also follow up because, again, he did mention that, and we're down to 70 days. And given the stakes, I would imagine that some sort of a designation either is or should be forthcoming. And I also would like to follow by asking, will that be part of the discussion -- hacking, if you will, cybersecurity -- when the President makes his way to China? Because I didn't get a chance to ask Ben about that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, every time that President Obama has sat down with his counterpart -- whether it was President Hu or President Xi -- there has been a discussion about cybersecurity. And you'll recall that about a year ago, when President Xi was here at the White House, there was an important commitment that was made by the Chinese President to abide by some important norms in cyberspace. And we certainly welcomed that announcement. And I would anticipate that this issue more generally will be on the agenda when President Obama has an opportunity to meet with President Xi later this week.\nQ: And last one from me. Did you read -- maybe you've had a chance to see -- the Washington Post did a pretty interesting bit on the Obamacare exchanges. Again, the continued sort of slide -- the numbers continue to trend downward. What is the level of concern here at the White House right now about that? In particular, I ask because as Aetna and others, UnitedHealthcare, continue to sort of shed participation, there is a criticism, at least among some of the folks who have to rely on Obamacare -- their premiums keep going higher, the choices keep shrinking. Tell me what the President has to say about that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this, because I do think there is one important fact -- that to the credit of Juliet's colleagues at the Washington Post, it was included in the story. And it's simply this: It's important to understand the context in which the CBO was putting forward these estimates about the number of people that would sign up on the marketplaces.\nCBO was based on an assumption that across the country you would see employers essentially kick their employees off of their health insurance and tell them to go sign up in the marketplace. The truth is, that has not happened nearly as often as our critics predicted. In fact, what we have found is that the vast majority of employers have continued to offer health insurance to their employees; that their employees continue to see that as an important benefit. And this actually is an example of yet another of the worst predictions about Obamacare not coming true.\nSo it's important for people to understand exactly the context of these numbers and what they show. That said, the administration is focused on making sure that we realize the potential around the marketplace to expand choice and opportunity for people all across the country. And what is clear is that the vast majority of people all across the country will have access to a plan that costs $75 a month or less. And these are plans that are quality plans, that meet a set of benchmarks that weren't previously available in an affordable way in the private insurance market.\nSo we have made important progress in terms of expanding choice, certainly from before Obamacare went into effect, and we have made important progress in keeping those choices affordable for the vast majority of individuals who go to shop in the marketplace.\nWhat we have also succeeded in doing is putting in place important consumer protections that people who don't shop on the marketplace but still get health insurance from their employer benefit from. And that's things like free birth control and being able to keep your kid on your health insurance program if you're a parent until they turn 26.\nSo these are important benefits that apply to everybody, not just people in the marketplace.\nQ: But if you're Aetna and you're shedding millions, tens of millions of dollars, this hasn't worked out so well at all.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, if you're Aetna, you've actually seen your stock price more than double since the Affordable Care Act went into effect. And the fact is, there are plenty of other insurance companies who are competing for this business who are doing it right.\nSo look, I'll let executives at Aetna explain their business decisions and to explain their struggles to make this process work for their bottom line. Plenty of other insurance companies have figured it out and are putting forward offerings that give the American people a choice when it comes to providing health insurance for their families.\nQ: So to put a cap on it, even though there are fewer choices for some consumers -- I'm not saying you're painting a perfectly rosy picture here -- you're saying there are some things that still have to be worked on because, clearly, it's not working out perfect, I imagine, based on how the President first pitched the idea.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is clear is there are far more choices that people have now than before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. And I think that is the important comparison for people to recognize.\nThe President has indicated a willingness to work with Democrats and Republicans on ideas to further strengthen the program. Let me give you two examples of that. The first is, there are still a lot of Republican governors across the country who have refused to expand Medicaid in their state. They do so solely for political reasons, not because of any substantive objection. And that's unfortunate, because you essentially have the federal government indicating that they'll pay for the vast majority of the expense of providing health insurance to those individuals at the bottom of the income scale in their state, but yet Republican governors in many states have opposed this.\nThat's had a bad impact on the health care situation for a lot of people across the country, and I think the human impact is the most important one. But what's also true, Kevin, is that there is a recent study that was completed over at HHS that indicated that states that haven't expanded Medicaid have actually seen health care costs grow by 7 percent more than states that did expand Medicaid. So the choices that some Republican governors are making to prevent access to health care for some are actually raising costs for other people in their state who are able to purchase health insurance. Again, this is the classic situation where people that don't have health insurance and don't have access to it because of a decision made by Republican governors, that ultimately other people who do have insurance have to pay the tab. So that's a bad policy decision by Republican governors, and that certainly is one thing that we'd like to see changed about Obamacare.\nYou've also heard the President talk about some of the potential benefits of Congress once again considering the idea of a public option. And I would expect that that's something that a future Congress and a future President will discuss.\nRon.\nQ: On Syria -- the 10,000th refugee hit the United States today. Is the President satisfied with this number? And I know the argument about the levels of humanitarian aid that the United States contributes to this crisis. But given the millions and millions of people who have fled that country, is the President satisfied that this goal -- that anyone would say is modest -- has been reached yet? And I gather he's going to set a goal for 2017, perhaps at the U.N. gathering in the coming weeks. Is that going to be much higher, or where is that going to be?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I appreciate you asking about this because it's not often I get asked about good news up here. And certainly over the last --\nQ: It isn't good news --\nMR. EARNEST: I think it is good news, particularly in light of the kinds of questions that I received over the summer about whether or not this goal would be met. And the truth is, this administration did succeed in meeting this goal -- a significant ramping-up of the number of Syrian refugees to the United States. And we were able to do all of that without cutting any corners when it comes to security. And significant screening was put in place to ensure that these individuals don't pose an undue threat to our national security. That's the kind of screening that every refugee applicant is subjected to. And we were able to meet this goal without cutting any of those corners. So the President is gratified that we have succeeded in meeting this goal.\nI think the President would like to see the United States continue to expand our ambition when it comes to responding to this global calamity. The United States has already stepped up to the plate and played an important leading role in the response, both in terms of providing more humanitarian assistance than any other country in the world, and we certainly are playing an important role here in accepting refugees from that conflict. The United States is obviously in a different place, literally, than countries in Europe. The United States is separated by a large ocean when it comes to these refugees.\nSo the situation that we face is different when it comes to this set of refugees. And the President does believe it's important for the United States to do our part. That's why we increased our ambition and admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. But I think the President certainly would like to see the United States continue to ramp up our commitment.\nQ: For all the success, wasn't this goal a response to political pressure from critics of the administration who did not want to see even 10,000 people admitted from Syria, admitted to this country? And again, the bottom line: For the biggest, most powerful country on Earth to admit 10,000 people from one of the most devastated places in the world just doesn't sound like a lot.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I think you're illustrating the dynamic here, which is that there are a lot of people out there who are saying that the United States has not done enough, and there are a lot of people out there who are saying that the United States has done too much and taken too many. And I think many of the people on both sides are playing politics. And President Obama is focused on doing the right thing and continuing to uphold the tradition of strong leadership in the United States when it comes to responding to a global calamity like we've see in Syria. And that response isn't just admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees, but it's also providing billions in humanitarian assistance, and also -- not insignificantly -- building a large international coalition to address the terror threat and the extremist threat that emanates from that situation.\nQ: Let me ask you one other question from a colleague of mine with CNBC who knows a lot more about this stuff than I do. There's a ruling by the European Union Commission that's expected tomorrow in Brussels that has to do with tax policy, tax laws, Ireland, U.S. companies, and how these companies are taxed and where the proceeds go. And apparently, the ruling is something that Treasury had tried to intervene in and tried to stop this ruling because it feels like it unfairly -- it does not fairly tax American companies, and that the Europeans are the beneficiaries of this and not the Americans. Again, you probably understand this better than I do, perhaps, but are you familiar with this ruling that's expected on Treasury's objections and concerns about this?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I'm familiar with the ruling. My colleagues at the Treasury Department are the experts here. I think what I can just say in general is that the United States is committed to tax fairness. And we want to make sure that the kinds of agreements that we reach with other countries are not manipulated to allow certain companies to shirk their responsibilities. And that's true both when we're talking about United States companies who have obligations to the United States in terms of bearing their tax burden, but that's also true of companies that are based in other countries and do business here in the United States.\nThe truth is, the complexity when it comes to these kinds of international tax agreements in some situations only makes it easier for countries in the -- or for companies in the United States to ship their profits overseas. And we certainly do not want to continue to perpetuate a system in which companies hide behind the complexity of this system in a way that disadvantages the United States and our economy.\nSo when it comes to the particulars of the ruling, I'll refer you to my colleagues at Treasury who can give you a more specific answer when it comes to the ruling. The principles that we take the closest look at is fairness, and we want to make sure that when we reach agreements with other countries, that those agreements are implemented fairly and in a way that they cannot be manipulated to allow companies to shirk their responsibilities.\nQ: Just one last thing, on the Paris agreement. Brian said that this could still be done through executive authority, that in falls in the category, and it is not a treaty that requires Senate approval.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: What is the -- why? Other than you saying it so, what makes it not be a treaty that requires ratification? Or what would require -- how do you do -- what's the distinction?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, maybe we'll have Brian give you a call on this. But my understanding is essentially this -- that the kind of authority that needs to be exercised to allow the U.S. to make these commitments that we committed to making in Paris is consistent with authority that Congress has already given to the President of the United States.\nQ: Right. That's a judgment against -- the question is -- I mean, is there -- is it because there's 155 countries, or because it was done in -- there's usually some clear distinction as to why something is a treaty or not. Or maybe it's not clear, obviously.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what it is, is it's related directly to the kinds of commitments that the United States agreed to in the context of the Paris agreement -- what are the steps that the United States is now required to take to live up to the terms of the agreement. And those steps that we have to take are steps that don't involve an act of Congress. So to put --\nQ: -- requires the passage of additional laws by states. But they do, don't they?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think this is where we can have Brian talk to you. But the bottom line is that there is no specific congressional action that's required to allow the United States to fulfill the commitments that we made in the context of the Paris agreement.\nPam.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Just to follow up on Ron's question about the refugees, it was a six-fold increase in the number of refugees in less than a year, at least. How would you reassure people who are concerned about maybe some radicalized person getting through that you were able to do this safely, given the process that's generally considered to be a two-year vetting process? Did you have the extreme vetting that we heard something about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that's a term that might have been used by somebody who doesn't currently work in the U.S. government. I'll stop there. (Laughter.)\nBut let me answer your question a couple of ways. The first is, this is a process that typically does take quite a bit of time. And I think what that would tell you, Pam, is that there are a number of people who are already in the pipeline when the President made this commitment. And essentially what the Obama administration was able to do was to mobilize resources, both within the intelligence community, within the Department of Homeland Security, to do things like deploy more officers to conduct interviews. You'll recall that this vetting of refugee applicants involves collecting biometric information, doing in-person interviews, doing background checks, running their information through a variety of national security and international databases. And a lot of that just requires personnel and expertise. And President Obama made this a priority.\nYou'll recall when the President made this commitment, he made clear that we weren't going to cut corners when it comes to security. And in order to meet this higher threshold, it was going to require not shortchanging the security steps, but actually increasing the resources that are being deployed to our security. And that's exactly what we've done. And the President is gratified that even in the face of a lot of doubt, this is a goal that was met a month ahead of schedule.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you. In previewing the President's trip to Laos, Ben acknowledged the legacy of war that the United States has with Laos. I'm wondering how the President intends to communicate that legacy with the people of Laos, and whether he'll apologize.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously this is going to be an historic trip on the part of the President. As I recall, it's the first time that a U.S. President has traveled to Laos. And obviously there is an interesting history, and certainly one that the President will confront quite directly when he goes to -- when he visits Laos next week.\nPart of what he'll do when he's in Laos is talk about the ongoing effort to recover unexploded ordnance. This is an unfortunate and violent legacy of war that ended I guess four decades ago now. And the President is aware of the impact that that legacy has on our ability to build a strong relationship with Laos. And this trip will give the President the opportunity to not just meet with his counterparts, but also to spend time with the people of Laos and to visit some of the cultural institutions there, but also to talk about this one element of painful legacy of the relationship between our two countries.\nQ: And then separately, the President is well known as a big sports fan. On Friday night, before the '49ers lost to the Green Bay Packers -- Go, Pack -- Colin Kaepernick decided that he would not stand for the National Anthem. He cited oppression to people of color and minorities. I'm just wondering if the President saw that, if he noticed that, watching SportsCenter over the weekend. Does he have any sort of reaction? Was that the wrong forum for Colin Kaepernick to take that action, coming from a (inaudible) Commander-in-Chief --\nMR. EARNEST: Given the President's interest in the sports world, I'm confident that he's aware of this issue. I have not spoken to him about it today. I think in general, what I can say is that I certainly don't share the views that Mr. Kaepernick expressed after the game in explaining his reasoning for his actions. But we surely all acknowledge and even defend his right to express those views in the settings that he chooses. That's what he's done. And even as objectionable as we find his perspective, he certainly is entitled to express them.\nMichelle, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Okay, thanks. Over the weekend, we heard the German economic minister say that, in his view, the T-TIP has failed. What is your view of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I understand that at least one of my counterparts at the EU has indicated that the work to try to complete a trade agreement between the United States and the EU is ongoing. Those negotiations have been underway for a couple of years now, and they continue.\nThe President has set a rather ambitious goal of trying to complete those negotiations by the end of the year. And that certainly is what his team is working to do. It's going to require the resolution of some pretty thorny negotiations, but the President and his team are committed to doing that. His team has certainly been empowered by the President to try to bring those remaining issues to a close, and hopefully we'll be able to get that done before the end of the year. But the work to do that continues.\nQ: It hasn't effectively failed at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: No. That's not the ongoing assessment. The ongoing assessment is that they're continuing to work to try to complete this agreement before the end of the year.\nQ: And quickly on the Syrian refugees numbers. Since that was a sort of lower goal with more to come, this year can you see sort of a projected number that we can say will come in?\nMR. EARNEST: In terms of the overall refugee count?\nQ: No, Syrian refugees in particular.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. The expectation I think is that we'll be right around 10,000 for fiscal year *2017 [2016]. The President, I think, put forward a slightly higher number for fiscal year *2018 [2017], and that's something that we'll consider. My understanding is that Secretary of State John Kerry actually has some conversations with Congress that will occur before we set the final figure for the number of Syrian refugees that would enter the United States during the next fiscal year.\nSo I would anticipate in the next few weeks we'll have some additional news on this. I think the President would like to see a ramping-up of those efforts, but I think the President is also realistic about how quickly that can happen.\nQ: Can you give us a -- I mean, in what range would the President like to see?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the estimate that we put forward last year, as I recall -- it was last year about this time when we were discussing this issue -- the President made a commitment to increase the number a few thousand over 10,000. But again, that's something that Secretary of State John Kerry will discuss with Congress. And hopefully we'll have more detailed information to provide on this before the end of next month.\nQ: And just one more thing -- just kidding. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Thanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 3:11 P.M.

In too many countries, repressive regimes confronted by citizens trying to hold their leaders accountable will resort to \"disappearing\" their critics. Some of these disappeared individuals are tortured and held for extended periods. Others are quietly killed with no official record of their deaths, compounding the grief of family and friends who are left to wonder why. Worldwide there are tens of thousands of unresolved enforced disappearance cases, some of which are decades old. The United States calls on countries to remove all obstacles to independent and transparent investigations into these cases so that those who have lost loved ones can finally learn their fate.\nIn recent years, we have continued to see high numbers of enforced disappearances, especially during times of conflict and repression. By some estimates, over 65,000 people have vanished in Syria since the conflict there began in 2011. According to the UN's Commission of Inquiry on Syria, this has included activists and others whom the Asad regime perceived to be insufficiently loyal to the government. Egypt has seen an unprecedented spike in enforced disappearances, with Egyptian security forces increasingly relying on this tactic to silence and intimidate the government's critics. Last August the UN Human Rights Council Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances reported a 100 percent increase in reported cases in Egypt over the previous year; in February, that same Working Group cited another forty new cases. And in North Korea, in a UN Commission of Inquiry reported at length in 2014 on how enforced disappearances are one of the many ways that government seeks to bolster its power by terrorizing its own people. We are also concerned about UN reports of disappearances in other countries -- from Eritrea to the case of pro-democracy activist Itai Dzamara in Zimbabwe. In our engagements around the world, the United States has raised with governments specific cases of enforced disappearances, and we will continue to do so at the most senior level.\nThe United States calls on all countries to put an end to enforced disappearances and hold accountable those responsible for this practice.", "timestamp": "2016-08-30", "title": "Press Release - Statement by National Security Advisor Susan E.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118910", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n11:33 A.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to questions. Darlene, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Thank you. Is there any reaction today to the French President saying the trade talks between the U.S. and the EU cannot be completed before the President leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, our position on this has not changed, which is that we are continuing to work toward a goal of completing those negotiations before the end of the year. And there are significant aspects of the deal that need to be negotiated, but that's precisely why the President is sending his Trade Ambassador, Mike Froman, to travel to Europe in a couple of weeks to go continue those negotiations. He was there in July; he'll be back in September -- and all in pursuit of the goal the President has laid out to try to complete these negotiations before the end of the year.\nI know that is a sentiment that my counterpart at the EU who's involved in talking publicly about some of these trade negotiations has also echoed. And that's the ambitious goal that we're trying to meet.\nQ: The French President's comments, as you know, follow comments earlier this week from a German official who said those talks were pretty much, basically dead. I mean, is it not time to sort of maybe give up on T-TIP and focus on TPP, as the President is going to be doing on the upcoming trip to Asia?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as you know, Darlene, the TPP agreement in terms of negotiating has actually been completed. And the work now on TPP that needs to get done is in the United States Congress. And we obviously will be working closely with leading Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to determine the most effective way to get that done before the end of the year. But that's a separate piece of work than continuing to negotiate with our partners overseas. So there's no reason that work on one needs to prevent work on the other.\nSo, look, Ambassador Froman is somebody that's got a rather ambitious view about the best way to pursue these kinds of agreements. And he's a tenacious negotiator, and I anticipate that when he travels to Europe in mid-September, that they'll be engaged in substantive discussions and hopefully will be able to make some additional progress.\nQ: Secondly, is there any reaction to, or comment on, the EU forcing Apple to pay gobs of money in back taxes? Is anyone here on the phone with anyone at the EU, sort of trying to talk this through?\nMR. EARNEST: If they were, apparently they'd have a lot to discuss this morning based on your interest in the economic relationship between the United States and Europe.\nLet me say a couple things about this. Obviously, this ruling is something that's attracted some significant news attention. I'm not going to be in a position to comment on an individual case, however, primarily because I know that there is a process for appealing these kinds of decisions. And I know that the Irish government has signaled their intent to appeal.\nSo I won't comment on any specific case, but there are a couple of important principles at stake here. And so why don't I just walk through a couple of those principles.\nThe first is, we are concerned about a unilateral approach in state aid negotiations that threaten to undermine progress that we have made collaboratively with the Europeans to make the international taxation system fair. And when I say \"fair,\" I mean fair primarily to taxpayers, but also fair to companies that are trying to do business around the world. That ultimately benefits the economies in countries on both sides of the Atlantic. And if there are concerns that the Europeans have about some of these international mechanisms, then we should continue to make progress by working through those issues jointly as opposed to a more unilateral approach, like a state aid investigation.\nSecond, it's also possible that the kinds of payments that were contemplated by the EU decision today at the end of the day are merely a transfer of revenue from U.S. taxpayers to the EU. I think that is the crux of our concerns about the fairness of this kind of approach.\nThirdly, we're going to continue to monitor this case and others that are being looked at by the Europeans. And it is our view that there's no reason that, as we monitor this case, that we shouldn't be able to continue to make progress on a shared goal, and that shared goal is to prevent the erosion of the tax base, to ensure that taxpayers in the United States and Europe are treated fairly, and to ensure that businesses are treated fairly.\nSo there's a lot at stake. And these are the kinds of issues that get a lot of attention behind the scenes inside the administration, and have for the last seven or eight years, particularly in an increasingly interconnected, global economy. That interconnectedness benefits the United States. It benefits our economy. It benefits workers. And it benefits U.S. businesses. But you also need a government, like the Obama administration, that's committed to fairness in fighting for the interests of U.S. taxpayers and U.S. businesses. So that's what we'll continue to do. And we're hopeful that we can continue to work through some of these issues in a collaborative, cooperative way with our European partners.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, your second point didn't make sense to me.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. Let me try to clarify.\nQ: You said it's a transfer of money from the taxpayers back to the EU --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: It would be a transfer of tax money from Apple to Ireland.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the issue, Jeff, as you know, is that the consequences for that transfer would be that it could be treated in the U.S. tax system as a current tax payment that would allow, essentially, Apple to deduct that EU tax payment from their U.S. taxes. That wouldn't be fair to U.S. taxpayers. And I think that's an indication of the concern that we have about why it's important for us to work collaboratively. We share the goal that's been articulated by the Europeans of preventing the unfair erosion of the tax base. We don't have an interest in seeing European taxpayers or the European economy suffer from the erosion of their tax base, and we're certainly going to do everything we can to prevent that from happening here. And President Obama has actually put forward several legislative proposals that would further prevent the erosion of a tax base. But unfortunately, Republicans have not acted on that.\nBut that's a different issue, but I cite that to indicate the President's -- the priority that the President has placed on this issue. That's why, Jeff, we would prefer -- if there are legitimate concerns that are raised by the Europeans about the erosion of their tax base -- that they actually work effectively with the United States to address those concerns collaboratively as opposed to taking the kind of unilateral approach that could have a totally unfair impact on U.S. taxpayers. And that's the nature of our concern and that's the point that I was trying to make there.\nQ: Does the U.S. have any sympathy for the concerns by the Europeans about an unfair playing field within Europe between a country like Ireland that has a much different tax base from others within the EU? That's also one of the things that they were trying to address here.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- I'm not going to get into any internal EU business, and I'll let the administrators at the EU evaluate the tax policies that are implemented by their member states. I think what I can say in general is President Obama has demonstrated a commitment to ensuring that U.S. taxpayers and U.S. businesses are treated fairly, because it's in our economic interest to see them be treated fairly around the world.\nAnd the view that -- the approach that President Obama has taken is that the American people and the American economy benefit when the United States is deeply engaged overseas to try to protect our interests. And the inclination to withdraw from that engagement is counterproductive and undermines the position of the U.S. economy and U.S. workers in an increasingly competitive international economy. That's why the President is going to spend a lot of time on this trip in Asia advocating for the ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and underscoring how the United States and the U.S. economy benefits from deeper U.S. engagement.\nIt's a separate issue, but a similar dynamic in play here in Europe, which is that the United States has invested a lot of time and energy and attention into trying to broker fair agreements when it comes to taxation policies between the United States and Europe. And we would welcome further coordination that could make potentially those kinds of arrangements even more fair.\nAgain, we don't have a built-in interest in seeing an unfair system perpetuate in a way that has negative impacts for the European economy, we just want something that's fair. And when I say fair, both to U.S. taxpayers but also to U.S. businesses. And the Obama administration is not going to hesitate to speak out when we perceive that U.S. taxpayers or U.S. businesses are being treated unfairly.\nQ: What kind of interaction is the White House having with Apple specifically about this? Who's talking to who?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to any specific conversations. What I can tell you is that Obama administration officials, not surprisingly, have heard from officials at Apple who are concerned about the way they're being treated by foreign governments. I think that -- it shouldn't be a particular surprise to anybody.\nBut I think what's also true is that the Obama administration has repeatedly indicated our willingness to go and fight for American taxpayers and American businesses overseas when they're being treated unfairly. And that's true when you consider actions that the United States has brought at the WTO. You'll recall that when it comes to cases that have been decided by the WTO, the Obama administration's record is undefeated. And that means that we have been tenacious advocates for American businesses and we've been effective advocates for American businesses.\nThat's also why we have sought to engage in the TPP. Trade negotiations involve leveling the playing field and raising the labor and environmental standards that everybody has to live up to. And the way that benefits the United States is that American businesses and American workers already live up to extraordinarily high labor and environmental standards, and when we impose those standards as part of an agreement, other countries increase their ambition. That is a tangible example of the Obama administration effectively and forcefully advocating for the U.S. economy, U.S. businesses and U.S. workers.\nSo this is just one example of that, but there are a variety of ways, particularly when it comes to the area of international trade, where the Obama administration has been a particularly effective advocate and enforcer of international standards because we believe that the effective observation of those standards by companies and countries around the world ultimately benefits the U.S. economy.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. When you look at the latest hacks of these voter databases, is the U.S. doing a good job on cybersecurity?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, what's true is that President Obama has made cybersecurity a national security priority. And President Obama has proposed additional resources being dedicated to this. You'll recall that the President included a specific proposal in his budget that Republicans, for the first time in more than 40 years, refused to even consider. They wouldn't even hold a hearing to discuss the budget with the President's top budget official.\nSo I think there are significant concerns that have been raised about whether or not Republicans in Congress understand that this should be a priority. But President Obama has certainly made it a priority. And whether it comes to working effectively with the private sector to safeguard the computer networks of businesses or even media organizations, the administration has been tenacious about that. We've also taken steps to try to upgrade the cybersecurity that is used to protect critical infrastructure and government computer systems.\nAnd so the President has made this a priority. We only wish that Republicans were willing to put the cybersecurity of the United States ahead of their own politics. Thus far, they haven't been able to do that.\nQ: But overall, do you think the U.S. is doing a good job to ward off these attacks?\nMR. EARNEST: I think there is no denying that the United States government is operating in a very dynamic environment; that the adversaries of the United States, whether they're criminal organizations or countries, are constantly probing the computer networks of the U.S. government and significant U.S. organizations looking for vulnerabilities. And we need to be conscientious and determined about our efforts to deter those kinds of incursions.\nAnd, yes, as a policy matter, this administration has made that a priority. We do have effective working relationships with technology companies and with private businesses to help them deter those kinds of intrusions. We do have effective working relationships with state and local governments to offer them resources and expertise as they try to protect their systems.\nBut this is a serious threat and one that the administration takes quite seriously. We're aware of the evolving nature of this threat, and we have taken the kinds of appropriate steps that the American people would expect their government to take to ensure that the American people are protected.\nThere is, however, more that we can do and more that we would like to do if Republicans in Congress were willing to do their job. But so far, they haven't been.\nQ: Okay. And we talked a lot about the Paris climate agreement yesterday and how that relates to the upcoming trip. And when you look at the latest studies that show that even if everybody gets onboard and implements this, the temperature change is still not going to be well below the two degrees, which was the goal originally. So how much is the President bothered by that, and how much will that factor into these meetings that he's going to have? Is he going to try to press for more to get it below that number? Or how does that factor in?\nMR. EARNEST: Michelle, you'll recall last year when we announced the completion of the Paris negotiations, that everybody involved -- not just the United States, but other countries who are signatories to the agreement -- acknowledged that it was an important first step, but nonetheless, it was a first step.\nAnd what was significant about this first step is that more than 198 countries, or whatever the tally is, were taking that step together; that there was a joint commitment on the part of countries around the world -- large and small, developed and developing -- working together to make progress.\nPreviously, even earlier in this administration, the approach had been somewhat different. You'd seen developing countries essentially looking to countries like the United States and other advanced economies to bear the weight and to bear the burden of dealing with this challenge. Instead, there's a much more collaborative approach that's being taken that has countries around the world invested in our success. And that does leave the President much more optimistic about the ability of the world to confront this challenge.\nI think what's also true is that there are a variety of ways in which the United States and countries around the world have been making progress even outside the context of the Paris agreement. And whether it's ongoing negotiations about HFCs that Brian Deese referred to yesterday, or other steps that the United States is taking to invest in renewable energy, there are other things that we can do that are even outside of the commitments that we made in the Paris talks that can continue to advance progress to confront the challenge that you referred to.\nQ: And speaking of climate, it looks like there's some really bad weather, maybe in the form of a hurricane, right around Hawaii. So how closely are you watching that? And what do you think are the chances that this is going to change the course of his trip?\nMR. EARNEST: Michelle, we are watching the weather in the Pacific Ocean closely in advance of the President's trip. At this point, based on the projected track of the storm, we do not anticipate it having any impact on the President's itinerary. But if that changes, we'll of course keep you posted.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A couple for you. First, the Agriculture Department says it's closed offices in five states because of unspecified threats. Is this something that has risen to the President's attention? And can you elaborate a little bit on the nature of these threats?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you is that the Department of Agriculture is working closely with the Department of Homeland Security to ensure the safety of their offices and the personnel that work there. I don't have any additional detail about the nature of the threat, but obviously when it comes to the safety and security of U.S. personnel, military or civilian, we take that quite seriously and we place the safety of those workers at a high priority. And in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, USDA has taken some prudent steps to ensure the protection of their facilities and their personnel. But I don't have any updates on the situation, but I'm sure that my colleagues at the Department of Agriculture will keep you updated in the days ahead.\nQ: Okay. And then on the trip, when you guys talk about TPP, you frequently say it's a choice between the United States sort of setting the rules and the trade framework in the region or China doing so. At this point in the President's tenure, does he view China as a regional rival, as a global rival? I mean, I don't think \"enemy\" is the right word, but how would you assess the relationship in those kinds of terms?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think I would do it in a couple of ways, Olivier. I think the first is I would acknowledge something that President Obama has repeated a number of times, which is that the United States welcomes the peaceful rise of China. China is a company -- is a country that has a large economy and a large and growing population. And we would expect that a country like China would see their influence rise, certainly in the Asia Pacific, but even around the world.\nThe United States welcomes that peaceful rise, and we welcome the kind of corresponding investment in international institutions and international norms that have presented a hospitable environment for China's rise. And I think that will be the nature of a lot of the kinds of discussions that President Obama will have not just with President Xi but with other countries in the Asia Pacific that are a little uneasy right now about the way that -- I guess I would say about the questions that have been raised about China's commitment to those kinds of international norms, international institutions.\nI think the best example of that, Olivier, would be the concerns about maritime security in the South China Sea. There has been a ruling from The Hague, and the question really now is: To what extent is China prepared to recognize and abide by that international ruling? I think there are a couple of good examples. Why don't I cite those quickly?\nThe first would be, obviously the United States and China have been able to work effectively together to establish a framework to address climate change. And as we discussed yesterday, the progress made by the United States and China in the context of that architecture really catalyzed broader international progress on this issue. And without that kind of progress between the United States and China, it's difficult to envision the kind of international progress that we've seen on this issue just in the last year or so. That's one example.\nThe second example would be on cybersecurity, which I think is a little bit more of a mixed message, which is that we welcomed the statement from President Xi in the Rose Garden when he visited the White House last fall indicating his country's commitment to abiding by a set of international norms and standards when it comes to cybersecurity and cyber espionage, and avoiding cyber theft for economic gain. There are other concerns that we have about China's activities in cyberspace, but we're hopeful that we can work to strengthen the architecture that governs everybody's activities in cyberspace. And certainly making progress on that issue with China, again, wouldn't just benefit the United States -- it would benefit the world.\nRon.\nQ: On the hacking situation, these election databases -- what does the administration think the Russians are up to? Why would they want to do something like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I would -- in terms of investigating some of these matters, I'd refer you to my colleagues at the FBI who can talk to you about what sort of response they have implemented to these reports. The U.S. government has not formally declared any specific entity or country as responsible for these reported intrusions. But my colleagues at the FBI are in a better position to speak about that if they choose to do so.\nQ: But in a more general sense, there was the incident involved in the DNC. Why would a foreign government want to hack into this particular type of -- is it just access for general data? Or is there some suggestion or some concern that there's some political influence that they are trying to impose at the state level or at the committee level?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, there's not a foreign government that's been assessed to be responsible for this reported activity. But if something like this is under investigation by the FBI, part of what they'll consider is the motive or the intent of the malicious actor, and there are a variety of ways that they can try to determine that. But that's obviously not something that I'll be able to speak about from here.\nQ: Chicago -- August has been the worse month in violence and homicides in several decades. Obviously, we focus on these things when we hit these milestones; I'm sure the President thinks about it all the time. What is his response to this? And more specifically, what is his response to the Trump statement that, essentially, he's going to make these shootings stop, and that he's the law-and-order candidate, and that the President has not done the job in this area generally, is the criticism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you've heard the President far too often express his profound sorrow at the incidents of gun violence that we've seen in this country.\nI guess I would start by saying it's important to keep the context in mind. Overall, crime levels in this country, including the level of violent crime in this country, is at or near historic lows. That's a good thing, and the American people have benefitted from that.\nThere are certain communities that have experienced a spike in gun violence in particular. Chicago, unfortunately, is one of those communities. And the President does believe this is something that's worthy of our attention. All too often, there is a flurry of media attention for 24 or 48 or 72 hours around an incident of -- around a mass shooting. I'm not suggesting that the media shouldn't pay attention to those issues, but what gets much less attention are the kind of day-to-day outbursts of gun violence that we see primarily in America's inner cities, including in a place like Chicago.\nAnd the President is deeply concerned about addressing some of the root causes of violence in those communities. The President is deeply concerned about doing a better job of preventing guns from falling into the hands of those who shouldn't have them. And too often, the kinds of guns that are used in carrying out these crimes -- these are guns that were obtained illegally. And there is more that Congress could do that wouldn't undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans, but would make it harder for criminals to get their hands on guns. And the President has been frustrated that more progress hasn't been made on that.\nThere's been a lot of focus and reporting on the relationship between the Chicago Police Department and some communities in Chicago. The President has made a strong case that addressing the sources of that mistrust can actually make our communities safer, can make our police departments more effective at doing their job. And I know that's something that Mayor Emanuel has been quite focused on, and I think there are some indications that the situation there has improved. But I think the Mayor would be the first person to say that there's more that they need to do.\nBut I think those are sort of three areas where the President is hopeful that additional progress would stem the rising tide of violence that we've seen in a handful of communities, including, unfortunately, Chicago.\nQ: But is there anything specific to Chicago that the President has seen and observed of these very prescriptions that he thinks specifically would deal with -- as you point out, crime is down in many places; it's spiking in a couple of places, specifically there. The police chief has talked about some of the sentences that gun offenders get or don't get, and we know about the gun control laws in Chicago versus surrounding communities. But when you look at that place, his hometown, is there something really more specific than that the President thinks should happen, like, now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any specific prescription that the President is prepared to put forward to address the situation just in Chicago. I know Mayor Emanuel is quite focused on that. And I certainly would have a lot of confidence in his ability to work through some of these issues and see if there are some specific local solutions that can be implemented. I'm confident that there are officials at the Department of Justice that have an expertise in this area that would be eager to lend that expertise, maybe even lend some resources to the city of Chicago and other communities that are experiencing a spate of violence like this.\nBut look, the President is deeply concerned about this situation.\nQ: And what about the more broad criticism by Donald Trump and others that he's the law-and-order candidate, that he's going to make the shootings stop, and that essentially he is saying that the administration hasn't done everything it should to rid the violence in --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, President Obama has presided over an eight-year period in American history where, across the country, violent crime is at or near historic lows. And the President has been committed to investing in professional police work and providing support to police officers and police departments across the country.\nBut when it comes to responding to the claims of the Republican nominee for President, I will let him make the case that he chooses to make for his candidacy. I think what I would encourage the American people to do is to press the candidates for specifics about how they intend to make progress on their agenda and evaluate those promises accordingly.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The Syrian refugee story, topping 10,000 a little bit earlier than perhaps anticipated. I'm just wondering from a broad perspective, how is this more humane than some of the illegal immigrants that try to make their way here that are also fleeing devastating and desperate circumstances all over, say, Central America for example?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the situations obviously are quite different.\nQ: I mean, different -- you're right. But I mean, they're both sometimes in devastating circumstances.\nMR. EARNEST: True. But our approaches to trying to confront these situations have been quite different. So let's talk about Central America first.\nThere are some communities in places like Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador that are racked by violence, where people are under grave threat from that violence. This administration has actually worked closely with the central governments in some of those countries to try to invest in crime-fighting initiatives, to invest in the kinds of programs that could address the root causes of that violence. And there's some progress that we've made.\nI guess the point is we have governments with whom we can work effectively in that region of the world to try to address these problems and try to stem the flow of people fleeing that violence. Recently, the U.S. government has been able to work effectively through the U.N. and the government of Costa Rica to establish an in-country processing system for refugees or people fleeing violence, I should say, from those countries. And we're hopeful that that will also sort of stem the tide of people who are tempted to try to make the dangerous journey from Central America up to the United States.\nAnd I think it's also consistent with our commitment to recognize the humanity in these individuals. These often are families or women and children who are fleeing a desperate situation. And it's important for us to not lose sight of that humanity.\nThe situation in Syria is quite different. For even as some of the civil institutions in Central America might be fledgling, those kinds of institutions in Syria are nonexistent. And there is no government that the United States can work effectively with to try to address the root problems that are causing so much chaos inside of Syria that's prompting people to flee to other places in the region and around the world.\nSo our approach there has been different. And our approach has included the United States being the largest donor of bilateral assistance to the humanitarian situation there. We've been strongly supportive of countries like Jordan and others, Lebanon, that are bearing a significant burden in terms of housing people fleeing violence. There are large camps of people who have fled Syria and are desperate to get access to just basic supplies. And that's putting a significant strain on other countries in the region, and the United States is trying to do our part financially to address that strain. The other thing that we can do is to work effectively with the U.N. to consider applications of people who want to apply to be refugees in the United States. And --\nQ: Including in Central America.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm talking about the situation in Syria right now. So one of the things, for example, that we can do to relieve the burden of the country of Jordan is to process some of those people, consider their application for refugee status, and put them through the paces in terms of ensuring that we are conducting all the relevant screening measures to do background checks, collect biometric information, to do in-person background interviews, to vet them through international databases that are maintained by organizations like Interpol, but also run them through databases that are maintained by the U.S. intel community and by the United States military. And after going through that screening, giving them the opportunity to resettle in the United States. That just means a smaller group of people for Jordan to support.\nSo there are a variety of ways that we have used international leadership and the resources of the United States to try to address these kinds of significant challenges. But the situations are so different, it's hard to compare the two.\nQ: Let me drill down a little bit on immigration, illegal immigration in particular. The President has been assailed as being the \"Deporter in Chief\" by some groups. Statistically, the numbers are pretty eye-opening. 2.5 million people deported. That's more than all the other Presidents combined. I'm just curious a couple things. First of all, one of the statistics I read from DHS suggests that, in 2015, 91 percent of those that were deported were criminals, or had previously had a criminal record. Is that really far afield from what Donald Trump was basically saying -- if they're a criminal, they're going to be out of here?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess it depends on the day you ask. (Laughter.)\nQ: Now, that's true. Good point.\nMR. EARNEST: So I think what I'll say is, when it comes to the President's record on this, we've made clear -- and I should say the Secretary of Homeland Security has made clear -- exactly what our enforcement priorities are going to be. And those priorities are the individuals that have a criminal record, individuals that pose a threat to national security, or individuals that have only recently crossed the border. And the President has been quite serious about making sure that we enforce the law, and that's exactly what this administration has done. What we've also tried to do is to enforce the law in a way that's consistent with our values.\nAnd that's why we want to focus our limited law enforcement resources on deporting felons and not breaking up families. That's the approach that the administration has taken. That is an approach that has led to significant investments in border security. There are more resources in terms of equipment and technology and personnel on the border than at any time in our system, and that's a testament to the President making that a priority. And the unfortunate fact is there would be even more resources on our border, securing our border, if Republicans in the House of Representatives hadn't blocked comprehensive immigration reform and merely perpetuated a system that even Senator Rubio described is the closest thing we have to amnesty.\nLook, that's on the conscience and on the hands of Republicans who have failed to deal with this situation. But President Obama has taken on this challenge with a lot of determination, a sense of seriousness, and ensuring that the policies that we have on the books and the policies that we have implemented are both consistent with our nation's status as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\nQ: Let me just get a couple more here really quickly. Secretary Kerry, in Bangladesh, made a comment about coverage as it relates to terrorism. And he said, \"Remember this -- no country is immune from terrorism. It's easy to terrorize. Government and law enforcement have to be correct 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 [days] a year. But if you decide one day you're going to be a terrorist and you're willing to kill yourself, you can go out and kill some people. You can make some noise. Perhaps the media would do us all a service if they didn't cover it quite as much.\" What does the President think about a statement like that -- maybe the media should tone down or back off in our coverage of terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think the President has talked about this a little bit himself. I think what the President's point would be [is] that the challenge that is facing the United States law enforcement, national security and homeland security officials is to be perfect. And --\nQ: But we should still talk about it, shouldn't we? And we should still cover it.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure, the President himself talks about it a lot. And we talk about the significant resources that are invested in protecting the American people both at home and around the world. I think the President wants to make clear that it's also important for people to have some perspective. And that kind of perspective is what he is hopeful will be part of a political debate about the most effective way to keep the country safe, but the most effective way for the United States to continue to live up to our values, and for the United States to continue to be a beacon of freedom around the world.\nQ: Last one, on Obamacare. Some modifications for after 2018, a series of fixes and adjustments. Can you tell me what that might look like and why the President feels like that would be important?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President and his team continue to be focused on the long-term health of Obamacare because there are millions of people all across the country who for the first time have access to quality, affordable health insurance because of the reforms that this administration passed and have effectively implemented.\nAnd at the same time, we're always looking for ways to strengthen the implementation of these policies, and the President is determined to ensure that we're handing off to his successor an Obamacare system that continues to strengthen, that continues to provide quality, affordable health insurance options to people all across the country, and that continues to provide important consumer protections, both to people who buy their health insurance on the marketplace but also people who have gotten and continue to receive their health insurance through their employer.\nQ: Does the fix imply that there's a problem?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the fix implies that there is more that we can do to strengthen the Obamacare system, and that's exactly what we're doing.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, on the Syrian refugees, you've talked about this being sort of a proud moment for the White House to finally reach its goal of the 10,000. Is there a reason we haven't heard from the President or seen the President? I mean, our neighbors to the north have their prime minister greeting Syrian refugees at the airport and we haven't even heard from the President on this one. Why not?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Margaret, I think you certainly will hear from the President when he travels to the U.N. next month, where he's going to convene an international meeting of leaders from around the world to discuss what steps countries around the world should take to address the population flows that we've seen not just in the Middle East but, frankly, around the world. And the President is determined to ensure the United States continues to play a leading role in mobilizing an international response to people who are fleeing violence who are otherwise in need of humanitarian assistance.\nSo I think the President has been quite visible on this, both in terms of advocating for this policy priority, and he will continue to be visible as he advocates for a more effective and better coordinated international response to dealing with this problem that plagues many regions around the world.\nQ: Well, that's the worldwide refugee problem that the President is going to be addressing in September. Is there something specific to Syrian refugees? I mean, that's the moment that was being hailed a success here. It was hard-won. Congress tried to block it. You had 30 governors in this country trying to block Syrians from settling in their states. This is a different issue than the rest of the refugee crisis in the rest of the world. Is there a reason that the President chose not to speak on it? Is it because, did someone say, diplomatically, this is like, what, one-fifth of 1 percent of Syrian refugees, so other countries like Germany and Canada and Jordan and Turkey are making us, by comparison, see this as such a small sliver? Or is it just because it's toxic politically? Or was there just a choice it wasn't something you wanted to address now?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think it's either of those things. Again, first of all, with regard to the way that other countries see us, the President is going to convene a meeting at the United Nations with other world leaders and the largest, brightest spotlight in the international community at the United Nations.\nQ: But not on Syria -- on all refugees.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, on all refugees. I don't think anybody -- I'm confident that the situation with regard to Syria will be a topic of extensive conversation in the context of that meeting. I don't think that's going to be lost on anybody.\nWith regard to the politics, I think you guys have heard the President more times than I can count over the last year talking about why handling this situation appropriately is the most effective way to protect the American people. And he's certainly done that in a political context, and he's certainly done that in the face of harsh political criticism from Republican presidential candidates, a variety of them, and also from senior officials in Congress.\nBut I think the President feels very good about the way that we have made that argument to the American people and the way that we've been able to overcome their objections to implement a successful policy. And the President believes that that's the right thing to do because it's consistent with our values as Americans. It's also consistent with our national security, and it's also consistent with the obligations that the United States has to lead on the pressing issues that are facing the world.\nQ: Will the President meet with any of the 10,000?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any meetings that the President has with individuals that have resettled to the United States.\nQ: Not handing out parkas at the airport?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think that he'll be doing that.\nQ: I want to also go back to what you were talking about with Apple and Europe there. What you point to in your response -- you said, it's also possible the kinds of payments Apple made are transferred to revenue from the U.S. to the EU. Are you signaling there some opening, some wiggle room for the resolution to be Apple to pay the U.S. rather than Europe? I believe there's a carve-out that would possibly allow for that rather than the current ruling.\nMR. EARNEST: As it relates to the way a ruling like this could be implemented, I'd refer you to my colleagues at the Treasury Department. I'm certainly no expert on this particular set of complicated issues. I think the point that I'm making when I make this point is that the unilateral approach that the EU has taken in some of these state aid investigations is fundamentally unfair. It attempts to re-litigate already-established taxation agreements that could set unfair new precedents. If there are specific concerns that European officials have about the fairness of certain tax policies, then they should engage in a conversation with the United States.\nWe have been able to work effectively together to solve some of these problems in the past. And acting unilaterally doesn't actually address the problems. In some ways, it has the potential to make them worse, particularly when you're evaluating the fairness of them. So with regard to the specific ruling and the impact it could have, I'd refer you to my colleagues at the Treasury Department. And I just can't speak in much detail about the specific ruling because it's subject to an appeal.\nWhat I can just say in general is that when it comes to this principle about addressing concerns the Europeans may have about the fairness of certain tax policies, a more effective approach is coordinating with the United States and working cooperatively to make progress as opposed to just acting unilaterally in a way that could set a new unfair precedent and ultimately disadvantage U.S. workers and U.S. businesses. And, frankly, that's something that the Obama administration will contest.\nQ: And on the Treasury issue, a statement on this last week saying they were concerned -- before the ruling -- saying they were concerned about all this, and that it was actually going to undermine, as you said today, your seeking tax fairness. Did you not have a dialogue -- did the administration not have a dialogue with European officials? Are you saying there that you didn't have any kind of conversation at that time about those concerns, or that those concerns weren't resolve in the conversations you did have, when you say that you're disappointed in terms of it being unilateral?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, for conversations the United States has had with Europeans about tax policy, I'd refer you to the Treasury Department. I know that they've had extensive conversations about a range of international issues. There's an ongoing dialogue about these issues.\nI'll let Treasury speak to the contents of the white paper that they issued last week. But I'm confident that that white paper was issued fully aware of the context in which it would be received, which is the impending decision that was announced earlier this morning, U.S. time.\nQ: So just to put a finer point on it, you're not -- the U.S. is not ready to say it's going to seek any kind of back payment of taxes as a way to resolve this?\nMR. EARNEST: I'd refer you to the Treasury Department for a direct answer to that question.\nQ: Okay. And I'm sorry, did you say when you were answering earlier about Apple, saying that you had heard from Apple -- what was the White House response to the Apple executives who have reached out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I just said as a general matter is that it shouldn't be surprising that a U.S. company would contact senior government officials when they have concerns about being treated unfairly in the international community, particularly with regard to the European Union, with whom the United States works quite closely and effectively on a range of issues.\nI didn't get into the nature of those conversations and I'm not going to be in a position to do that from here. But I don't think it should be particularly surprising to all of you who cover these kinds of issues closely to hear that officials at a major U.S. company contacted the U.S. government when they were concerned about being treated fairly [unfairly] in the international community.\nQ: And you're not going to say which individuals reached out and to whom here at the White House, or whether it was the President?\nMR. EARNEST: I won't. I'm not aware of any conversations like this that involved the President directly. And I'm not in a position to confirm any individual conversations that have been had by the White House.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The President is scheduled to meet with Secretary Burwell later this afternoon. Is there a particular focus of that meeting? And sort of related, now that summer is winding down, has there been any rethinking of how much Zika funding is still needed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Cheryl, there's been no rethinking of the amount of money that the administration needs for Zika. Our public health professionals work closely with the President and the administration to put forward a specific, detailed package that would allow them to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. Republicans in Congress have blocked action on that package. That's quite unfortunate. And it has prevented, as I said, our public health professionals from doing everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\nAnd right now, members of Congress are enjoying a seven-week break. Some members of Congress, including Mitch McConnell, are spending that seven-week break bragging about not doing their job. That's unfortunate. I don't think that's how most Americans are spending their summer, but I guess the rules are different when you're a Republican leader in the United States Congress.\nBut we're hopeful that when they do return, that Republicans in Congress will have had an opportunity to rethink their priorities and will once again put the health and safety and wellbeing of the American people back at the top of the list where it belongs.\nQ: And meeting with Secretary Burwell? Is there any --\nMR. EARNEST: The President regularly meets with his HHS Secretary. And part of what I'm confident they'll discuss is the ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act. That's something that the President does periodically, and I'm confident that will be part of the discussions again today.\nAndrew.\nQ: Thanks. I want to go back to U.S.-EU trade. Do you think it's a coincidence that France and Germany have elections soon, that these comments --\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't speculate on the impact of upcoming elections on the public statements that we've seen from some European officials.\nQ: What are the consequences if you don't get (inaudible) in place by the end of the year?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry, say that one more time?\nQ: What are the consequences if you don't get negotiations concluded by the end of the year?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think then obviously the next President will have to determine the path forward. We've made important progress in negotiating T-TIP, and there are a number of details that remain to be worked out. And as we always say in the context of these kinds of negotiations, nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to. But we made important progress, and the President has directed his team to try to meet a rather ambitious goal and to try to complete those negotiations before the end of the year.\nThat's certainly what we're aiming to do, but if that doesn't get done, we're hopeful that enough progress will have been made that the President's successor will be able to take up these negotiations and hopefully continue that progress. But I wouldn't prejudge exactly what that's going to look like.\nQ: And just a final question on Iraq. General Votel has said that he believes that Mosul can be retaken this year. Is that the view of the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, nobody is going to be in a better position to put forward that kind of assessment than General Votel. And obviously he is both keenly aware of the kind of support that U.S. and coalition troops have provided to Iraqi security forces. He's also keenly aware of the fact that officials in Iraq will determine the pace of operations there, and they will ultimately make the decision about when to go after Mosul.\nBut General Votel and other senior military leaders in the United States have been in close touch with their Iraqi counterparts. So he's certainly in a good position to make that kind of assessment, and I would defer to him for those kinds of pronouncements.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back on Apple and the EU. The fact that Apple has so much money that they could be charged in Europe, does that say anything about the U.S. tax system and why a U.S. company feels the need to have so much of its money abroad? And does this ruling sort of make the case that there should be corporate tax reform, or Treasury should take some action to encourage companies not to have so much of their money overseas?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, I'm limited in how I can answer your question because I'm not going to talk about the individual business practices of one company. And I'm obviously limited in what I can say about this specific ruling.\nI think what I can say in general is we've spent a lot of time over the last several years talking about why the President believes that tax reform should be a priority. Right now, our tax code wrongly gives too many companies an incentive to ship jobs overseas. And we should close some of those loopholes. And by closing some of those loopholes, we could more effectively ensure that we can invest right here in the United States of America. That also would contribute to a more fair system of taxation. The kind of loopholes that you and I are both referring to are not the kinds of loopholes that middle-class families benefit from.\nSo the President is going to continue, even through his remaining four months here or so in office, making the case that the next Congress should make closing some of those loopholes a top priority.\nQ: I also wanted to ask about a report that the FBI is going to be releasing publicly, the details of this recommendation for the Justice Department on the Clinton email investigation. Did the White House have any opinion about this decision? Were you consulted? And what's your general reaction to the fact that we're going to be hearing more about this investigation and its internal documents from the FBI?\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen those reports. I can tell you that the White House did not consult with the FBI about that decision or any of the other decisions that they've made in terms of handling some of the investigative material that they've collected when they looked into this matter. So I'll leave it to them to describe what steps they're taking and why they're taking them. With regard to the potential impact on the election, there are any number of people that are employed by your news organizations that will speculate about the potential political impact or political fallout. I'll let them do that.\nQ: All right. And just one more on the situation in Syria with Turkey. Is the President satisfied at this point with the fact that, I guess, two of our allies have seemed to have been attacking one another, but it seems like they're trying to work it out. Can you talk about where the White House is one that today?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. I can say that the United States welcomes the overnight calm between the Turkish military and other counter-ISIL forces in Syria. The United States continues to encourage these moves as a way to prevent further hostilities and loss of life between all counter-ISIL forces operating in the area. Our priority here, Toluse, needs to be on fighting ISIL. And that's why we describe it as the counter-ISIL coalition. That's why these forces have signed up to work closely with the United States and other coalition members, because they're concerned about the impact of ISIL. And we believe that, in making decision about appropriate military actions, it's important to be focused on the shared goal of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.\nSerena.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to go back to the hacking. So the Senate Minority Leader sent a letter to the FBI expressing concern for the Russian government tampering with the presidential election. Do you guys actually see cyber threats affecting the outcome of the election as a real possibility here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Serena, as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, I'm not going to be in a position to confirm any individual entity or criminal enterprise or government as responsible for the reported hacking at the DNC. I think more generally what I can say is that U.S. officials, particularly at the Department of Homeland Security who have primary responsibility for protecting the American people in cyberspace, take all these kinds of reports and threats quite seriously. And that's why, just within the last couple of weeks, Secretary Johnson, over at DHS convened, a conference call with election officials all across the country to talk to them about the resources that the DHS has and can be made available to them to safeguard their systems.\nI think people can have a lot of confidence in the election system, in part between it's not centralized. Elections are administered and conducted by state and local authorities, which means you essentially have a patchwork of systems across the country that maintain the records and administer these elections. Sometimes the consequences for that kind of varied system means that it's hard to implement reforms across the board. It's hard to implement reforms across the board. That also makes it harder to hack the system. It certainly wasn't designed that way, but that is one of the benefits.\nSo we take this threat seriously. The response from DHS, I think, is a pretty good indication of how seriously we take that. There is an active discussion going on among the President's national security team about whether or not to designate election administration systems in the United States as critical infrastructure. If so, that would qualify those systems for enhanced protection and enhanced resources from the federal government. But no decision has been on that at this point. In the meantime, we'll continue to stay in close touch with election administrators to help them safeguard their systems and continue to give people confidence in the ability of the election to take place and for us to continue to have confidence in the results.\nQ: But the FBI has said that one state was successfully hacked, and there was another attempt on another state. And then if you designate it as critical infrastructure by the federal government, aren't you kind of admitting that there's big weaknesses in those states?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think -- first of all, with regard to the FBI's communication with computer systems administrators across the country, I'd refer you to them. They can talk to you about their assessment about the way that they've talked about this threat.\nAgain, what I think is true is that we're vigilant about the threats that exist out there, and it's an evolving environment, and so we need to be aware of the fact that our adversaries -- whether they're criminal or state-organized -- that they're always evolving, and they're dynamic and that they're tenacious. And we need to devote significant resources and be similarly creative to deter those threats. And we certainly are committed to working state and local officials who are responsible for administering elections to help them do that.\nQ: When would that decision be made by the actual security team?\nMR. EARNEST: That's something they're continuing to evaluate. I don't have a timeframe for you as this point.\nQ: Okay. And then turning back to Central America, the Ecuadorian mission here in D.C. delivered a letter to the State Department yesterday with nine Latin American foreign ministers expressing deep concern about the negative effects of the U.S. migration policy across their region with respect to Cuban migrants. Given that the President has opened up Cuba more -- first flights, direct commercial flights starting tomorrow -- is there any consideration of adjusting that wet-foot/dry-foot policy that is really impacting a region that you yourself said partner closely with to address their own migrant crisis coming across the southern border in the U.S.?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the United States lives in a region of the world where our migration policies are complicated. And there's essentially patchwork system that's in place that administers and enforces those laws. And as I mentioned earlier, the administration has not put forward a congressional proposal seeking to change that.\nQ: But these are countries who are trying to stem their own flow into our country and they're saying your policy with respect to Cuban migrants are really impacting us personally -- we can't focus on these things when we have to deal with the Cuban migrant situation because of the U.S. policy that treats Cubans different than every other nationality in the world.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have been committed to working effectively with countries in the region to address some of the migration challenges, whether it's with regard to individuals fleeing violence in Central America or Cubans seeking to use a land route through Central America and Mexico to enter the United States.\nOne of the benefits of the efforts that we have made to reform our approach and relationship with Cuba has been to have a positive impact on our relationship with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. And that certainly has made the United States more effective in trying to resolve these concerns that have been raised.\nQ: And given the flights starting tomorrow, is there any announcements of new Cuban regulations coming forward? Any plans to finally nominate an ambassador?\nMR. EARNEST: Nothing that I'm prepared to announce at this point.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, over the weekend, a Senate Republican spokesman said that the Senate could use one of its pro forma sessions this week to pass the Zika funding bill if the Democrats withdrew their objections. Is that something the White House has no interest in?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, I think what the Democrats in the Senate would like to see -- it's what the Democratic and Republican governors across the country would like to see and it's certainly what this administration would like to see, is Congress act on the funding request that is supported by our public health professionals. That's the $1.9 billion funding request that the administration put forward back in February, more than six months ago, and Republicans continue to block that request even while they're enjoying their six, seven-week recess.\nQ: So the smaller bill would not be of interest to the administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think we have made clear that we need to see Congress act. And the current bill that was passed by the House includes a bunch of ideological riders, including some that involve the Confederate flag and blocking funding to Planned Parenthood, even though we're talking about a disease that could be transmitted sexually. So that doesn't make a lot of sense. Frankly, neither of those provisions makes a lot of sense. And I think that is a clear indication that Republicans in the House -- and apparently now Republicans in the Senate -- are much more interested in politics than they are in protecting the American people from the Zika virus.\nQ: On another issue, you've seen the stories in recent days on the release of Secretary Clinton's schedules -- private schedules at the State Department. I was wondering if there's any chance the White House would release the President's private schedules during his time in office.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't anticipate that the President will do that during his time in office, but consistent with the Presidential Records Act, at some point the President's schedules will be made public and presumably you'll have the opportunity to peruse them when you are enjoying a visit to the Barack Obama Presidential Library at some point. (Laughter.)\nQ: Why wouldn't his policies on transparency apply now and not after he leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, because the President is committed to complying with the Presidential Records Act and that's what we'll do. And that will ensure that the American public does have an opportunity to take a look at his schedule.\nJane, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you very much, Josh. Does the President have any schedule to bilateral meeting with South Korean President Park Geun-hye at the G20? If he do so, what wider issues will they be discussing at the meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any formal bilateral meeting that the President will have with President Park, but I can tell you that it's not uncommon for the President to have an opportunity to visit with some of his counterparts along the margins of some of these meetings. So I don't know whether or not something like that is planned at this point, but if something like that does occur, we'll certainly let you know. And if there's an opportunity, I'm confident that the President will use it to express the United States' strong support for the safety and security of our allies at the Republic of Korea.\nQ: Any bilateral meeting with other contacts, China and Japan, so he can do so -- this kind of situation in Korea right now -- political situation, so they can talk about possibilities --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any multilateral meetings that are planned, but if there's an opportunity for the President to once again express his strong support for the safety and security of our allies in South Korea, then I'm confident he won't let that opportunity pass by.\nThanks, everybody. Take care. Hopefully we'll see some of you in Asia.\nQ: Quiet afternoon --\nMR. EARNEST: We'll see.\nEND 12:41 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "Remarks as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119806", "text": "Thank you. I am so thrilled to be back in Washington.\nTogether, we are going to work hard over the next 70 days and we are going to win this state – and we are going to win the White House.\nIt's going to be a victory for the people. A victory for the everyday citizen whose voice hasn't been heard.\nIt will be a win for the voters – not the pundits, not the journalists, not the lobbyists, not the global special interests funding my opponent's campaign.\nThis is going to be YOUR victory.\nWe are going to create the New American Future our children deserve.\nIn this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the workforce.\nCrumbling roads, bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves.\nFamilies trapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity.\nGovernment will become lean, effective, responsible – and honest.\nOur border will be protected, and our children will be safe.\nWe will rebuild our inner cities, and provide safety and peace to all of our citizens.\nAmerican values and culture will be cherished and celebrated once again.\nBut to achieve this future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past – and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies.\nOne area where honesty is badly needed is on the subject of economic and living conditions for African-American citizens in the United States.\nMillions of African-Americans in this country have succeeded greatly, and their contributions to every area of our life – now and throughout our history – should be celebrated and cherished. This includes the amazing achievements in art, science, sport, music, medicine, business and so much else. This includes millions of African-American entrepreneurs, innovators and the millions of African-American workers in our middle class.\nBut we must also talk about those who have been left behind, the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner cities – and neighborhoods afflicted by poverty, drugs, and violence.\nNo group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies than African-Americans.\nThere is no better evidence of this fact than Hillary Clinton's immigration policy, which brings in illegal immigrants and refugees to take jobs from hardworking African-American and Hispanic citizens.\nInstead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and provide jobs to struggling Americans.\nTonight, I am asking for the vote of every African-American and Hispanic citizen in this country who wants a better future.\nThe inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic Party for fifty, sixty, seventy years.\nThese Democratic policies – the policies of Hillary Clinton – have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, broken homes, and rising crime.\nNearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working. Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty since 2009.\nIn Detroit, half of all its residents do not work. In Milwaukee, almost 4 in 10 African-American men between the ages of 24-54 do not have a job.\nHere, in the state of Washington, 65% of Latino children and 60% of African-American children live in low-income households.\nChicago just had the most violent month in 20 years. More than 2,800 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nIt breaks our hearts.\nWe cannot let this violence continue. It must be ended.\nUnder A Trump Administration, it will be ended.\nIt will be my priority to work with communities, local police, state police and federal law enforcement to dismantle the gangs and to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty and fear. I will appoint the best judges and prosecutors and federal investigators who will make this their personal mission.\nThere is one thing which can no longer be denied: if you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results. To those suffering, I say: what do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump? I will fix it. I will fight for you as no one ever has before.\nLet me also tell you what you have to gain: jobs, opportunity, security, and safety.\nThis means so much to me.\nI believe every child in this country – in Detroit, in Baltimore, in Chicago – has the right to live out their lives in safety and peace.\nIn the Wall Street Journal, Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute just wrote an important article about the soaring crime in our inner cities, and the responsibility of Democratic politicians for creating this problem.\nThe article is called: \"Black Lives Matter to Donald Trump.\" McDonald writes that \"Mr. Trump's call to restore law and order recognizes the right of inner-city residents to enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest of America now takes for granted.\"\nFreedom from violence is one of the great civil rights issues of our time. So too is the issue of school choice.\nWe will fight for the right of parents to send their kids to the school that they believe gives their kids the best shot at success.\nI will not accept a future in which children of any color in this country are not fully included in the American Dream. Our whole country loses when we leave millions of talented, aspiring Americans on the sidelines. We want to give everyone a chance to contribute their full talents to our economy and our country.\nRemember: the Republican Party is the Party of Lincoln, the party of freedom, equality and opportunity. It is the Democratic Party that is the party of slavery, the party of Jim Crow, the party of oppression.\nNothing makes me more honored and proud than to be the nominee of Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party.\nOur party will fight to bring hope to every forgotten stretch of this country.\nOnce again, we will be One American Nation.\nOne United People.\nAnd we will have One Great Future.\nThat great future will be built on these three critical words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nThis will include a complete revitalization of our manufacturing sector, which has been so badly hurt by Hillary Clinton's policies.\nWe are bringing the jobs back to our country.\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA, keep out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, stand up to China, and fight for every last American job.\nThe destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved.\nThat would be a disaster. We won't let it happen.\nBut that's just the beginning of what we are going to do for American workers.\nOn taxes, we are going to provide massive tax relief to all working people, and lower the tax rate on small business from 35% down to 15%. Low and middle-income parents will also be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes.\nOn regulations, I am going to direct every agency and Department Head in my government to identify all needless and job-killing regulations and they will be removed. We will have a temporary moratorium on new regulations to allow our economy to grow and thrive.\nEconomic growth for last quarter has been revised down to 1.1%, a total disaster. Meanwhile, our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.\nWe will further bring back our jobs by unleashing an American energy revolution – lifting restrictions on oil, coal, natural gas and all sources of American energy. This will create millions of jobs and lower the price of energy for all families.\nWe are also going to secure our border to stop the drugs from pouring in. The Seattle-area recently experienced the largest number of heroin-related deaths in 20 years. We have to stop the drugs poisoning our communities.\nAnother major issue in this race is foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another – beginning with her support for going to war in Iraq in the first place, which I opposed.\nHer tenure as Secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in U.S. history.\nLook at the world before and after she became Secretary of State.\nPre-Hillary, in early 2009, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.\nLibya was stable.\nSyria was under control.\nThe group we know today as ISIS was close to being extinguished.\nIran was being choked by sanctions.\nNow, fast-forward to present time.\nAfter Hillary, here is what the world looks like:\nIraq is in total chaos.\nSyria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.\nISIS has been unleashed onto the entire world.\nIran – the world's top state sponsor of terrorism – has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, and was given a $400 million dollar cash ransom payment.\nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and terrorism.\nAmerica deserves a better legacy.\nAll of you deserve a better future. I am the change agent.\nHillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo.\nWhile our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time. Bill Clinton's speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State – Bill was paid almost $50 million dollars for speeches during her tenure, an increase of 44% over the previous 4 years.\nThen there was all the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations.\nIt was pay-for-play. Just look at what she did with UBS, or the Russian Uranium, or disaster relief in Haiti, and so many other examples.\nBut the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 emails she deleted.\nHillary Clinton said under oath that she turned over all of her work-related emails. But we know that is one more Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she never turned over, and then another 15,000 emails were just discovered a few weeks ago.\nNow, today, another 30 emails were discovered by the State Department that Hillary Clinton failed to turn over – these were emails about Benghazi.\nIt just never ends with the Clintons.\nThere is only one way to get justice in this rigged system and that is to show up and vote on November 8th – and to vote big.\nIn A Trump Administration, the State Department will work for the country – not for Hillary Clinton's donors.\nUnder Hillary Clinton, it's the powerful protecting the powerful.\nPoliticians defending politicians.\nInsiders fighting for insiders.\nI am fighting for you.\nThe government will work for citizens once again.\nThe era of division will be replaced with a future of unity.\nWe are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common. We will proudly promote our culture as Americans, the best in the world.\nIt is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve.\nThis is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a thriving economy, and a just society for each and every American.\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.\nTogether, We Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nThank you, and God Bless.", "timestamp": "2016-08-30", "title": "Remarks at the XFinity Arena in Everett, Washington"}

We are committing to match one dollar for every two dollars in pledges made by other donors through September 30th, 2017. We are calling on all partners to contribute generously in order to leverage our matching pledge to reach the Global Fund's replenishment goal of $13 billion for the three year period from 2017 to 2019, averting 300 million new infections and saving an additional 8 million lives ?from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis by 2020.\nIn 2013, the United States hosted the Global Fund's Fourth Replenishment Conference and matched one dollar for every two dollars that other donors contributed to the Global Fund, ultimately pledging $4.1 billion to fund AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria grants. Working with partners--including the Global Fund, governments, civil society and communities--and building on the work of previous administrations, we have already made significant progress. Together, we have saved an estimated 6 million lives from malaria and 43 million lives from tuberculosis since 2000. Globally, 17 million people are receiving lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatment, and the United States remains committed to supporting nearly 13 million people with lifesaving treatment by the end of next year through PEPFAR.\nWhile we are turning the tide against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, too many around the world—especially in areas of conflict—still fall victim to these diseases. Now is the time for the world to accelerate its efforts by making smart investments and evidence-based interventions in the most at-risk places. The United States is proud to do its part. That is what this announcement is all about—making long-term commitments to keep up the fight, because every country has a role to play to help wipe out these diseases once and for all.\nA generation free from the scourge of these horrific diseases is in sight. It is our duty to fight for that future. The United States remains confident—buoyed by the progress we have made and building on the partnerships we have developed—that the world will rise to the challenge. Together, we can and will continue working to rid the world of these debilitating illnesses and save the lives of millions.", "timestamp": "2016-08-31", "title": "Press Release - Statement by National Security Advisor Susan E.

EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. Welcome aboard Air Force One. Obviously, you all are on board anticipating the President's extensive travels through Asia. Before we leave the United States, however, the President will be spending time today at a summit at Lake Tahoe, organized by the Democratic Leader in the Senate, Harry Reid.\nThe President will spend some time speaking at the 20th convening of this summit about the importance of conservation. This is a policy priority that the President identified early in his presidency, and he's worked closely with congressional leaders across the country, including Harry Reid, who have also identified this as a priority. And the President will spend some time talking about the legacy that Senator Reid leaves behind when it comes to conservation, but he'll also talk about why conservation is a critical component of any of our efforts to fight climate change. Obviously, Lake Tahoe is a fitting setting for a conversation like that.\nFrom there, the President will fly to Hawaii. And upon arrival in Hawaii, the President will address a dinner that's being hosted to mark both the World Conservation Congress and the Pacific Island Conference of Leaders. And this will be an opportunity for the President to identify the important role that the United States is playing in leading the international community's response to climate change and conservation. So that will be the end of what will be a very long day for all of us.\nThe President will head to the Midway Atoll tomorrow. You guys will be along for that trip. And we'll gaggle in advance of that travel, so we can talk more about that trip tomorrow.\nBut with that, why don't we open it up to whatever questions may be on your mind.\nQ: Can I ask about the killing of Adnani, whether you have any more details about that -- whether it was, in fact, the U.S. involved -- that did this? And then more importantly, what it means, in your view, for the overall campaign against ISIS, how significant is the loss of this figure for ISIS?\nMR.

Mr. Adnani was a senior ISIL official. He's often described as spokesperson for the group, but he also has played an active role in recruiting supporters for ISIL. He's also been a leading proponent of a strategy that encourages individuals to carry out lone-wolf attacks around the world. His death would represent a significant blow to ISIL. One of the priorities that we've identified for this campaign is removing external plotters from the battlefield. And Mr. Adnani has played a leading role in those activities.\nSo my colleagues at the Department of Defense are continuing to work to assess the results of the operation that was carried out yesterday. When they have more details about those results, they'll share them. But if his death is confirmed, it would represent a significant blow against ISIL.\nI would point out that there have been some reports of Russian officials indicating that Russia may have been involved in this effort. I'm not aware of any facts that would substantiate a claim like that.\nQ: There was no cooperation with the Russians on this at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'm not in a position to confirm any facts related to any kind of Russian involvement in the operation that was carried out yesterday targeting Mr. Adnani.\nQ: A question on Syria. Turkish state media is saying that the U.S. failed to respond to a Turkish request for air support for their troops that are battling ISIS in Syria. I'm wondering if you can talk through at all if that's true; if the U.S got that request, why it would have denied it, if they did get the request on that.\nMR. EARNEST: I have not seen those news reports. So, Justin, I would actually refer you to my Department of Defense colleagues who may be able to give you an operational update. What I do know to be true is that U.S. forces were instrumental in supporting Turkish operations along the Turkish-Syria border over the weekend, where Turkey did have some success in driving ISIL out of Jarabulus. So I'm not sure exactly what this report is referring to.\nThere have been a significant number of U.S. operations carried out in support of Turkish military efforts on the ground against ISIL. We've obviously been encouraging the Turks to take actions along their border targeting ISIL for quite some time. And when they did finally take more of those actions that we've been asking for, we did localize military support to assist them.\nSo I'm not sure if this specific report is a reference to some other request that was put forward by the Turks, but my colleagues at the Department of Defense may be able to speak to that issue in more detail.\nQ: Does the President have any thoughts on Mr. Trump's visit to the border?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not spoken to the President in a lot of detail about Mr. Trump's plans for today. I can tell you that it is not uncommon, of course, for leading presidential candidates to make overseas trips. In 2008, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama traveled overseas, both to the Middle East and Europe. And again, that's consistent with presidential candidates making overseas trips to visit America's closest friends and allies.\nYou'll recall when President Obama took that trip, the highlight was a trip to Germany -- at least one of the highlights was a trip to Germany -- where the President spoke in Berlin to a crowd of about 100,000 Germans who warmly received him and enthusiastically cheered his speech. We'll see if Mr. Trump is similarly received.\nQ: Josh, I'm wondering what the White House made of the results of several primaries last night, the fact that so many incumbents -- John McCain, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Marco Rubio -- seemed to easily skate into the general election. Did the White House see that as an indication that the anti-establishment fervor this year has been overstated?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I think it's hard to generalize to that degree, in part because some of the candidates that you refer to were people who entered their primary campaigns on pretty strong footing. So I think it's hard to draw a nationwide assessment of the political climate based on a handful of primaries in two states. That said, the President was quite pleased to see a couple of Democratic candidates that he had strongly endorsed emerge victorious in those contests. And those contests didn't end up being particularly close.\nSo I think that might be one indication of the President's deep reservoir of support among Democrats, primarily because that's part of the trend that we've seen all across the country. The President's track record, when it comes to Democratic candidates that he endorsed emerging victorious in the primary, is quite strong.\nSo I think that's an indication that the President does have some sway with voters across the country, and I think he intends to use that influence in the context of a general election. I think the other dynamic that is in play is, at least a couple of the individuals who are facing primary contests had been supporters of the President's trade agenda. So I think that also might be an indication -- again, because it's a continuation of a theme that we've seen across the country -- that the political vulnerability facing those candidates that are taking a smart approach to trade might also be overstated.\nI know that, at least on the Democratic side, there was some noise that some establishment figures in the Democratic Party were going to target supporters of the President's trade agenda in Democratic primaries. Those primaries didn't end up being all that competitive. And again, that's not just the case in Florida; that was true of all 28 House Democrats who supported the President's trade agenda.\nSo I think that is a pretty good indication of where the politics are in this situation. I think as with a lot of things when it comes to the United States Congress, it's apparent that some members of Congress might be a little behind the curve when it comes to the politics of the President's strategy around trade policy.\nQ: During the Asia portion of the trip, the President is going to meet with the President of the Philippines. He said yesterday that -- basically something along the lines of, President Obama needs to listen first and then talk during the meeting. Do you have any response to him?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, the Philippines is a treaty ally of the United States. And the President values the important relationships that we have not just maintained, but strengthened with our treaty allies around the world. And one of the -- there are a variety of benefits associated with being a treaty ally of the United States. And certainly as the Philippines deals with some of the maritime security situations in the South China Sea, they benefit from a close relationship with the United States.\nYou'll recall that when President Obama traveled to the Philippines last fall, the President spent some time not just meeting with his counterpart, but also spending time observing cooperation between the U.S. Coast Guard and the navy that's maintained by the Philippines. In fact, there is a Coast Guard vessel that had been decommissioned, transferred to the Philippine navy, refurbished, and is now being used to enhance maritime security in the Philippines. So that is one tangible benefit of the effective relationship that the United States has built with the Philippines that has consequences for the Philippines' national security.\nAnother feature of our alliances is the President's not just ability, but willingness, to speak bluntly -- even on those issues where there might be some daylight between the United States and our allies.\nQ: After listening.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think the President is going to speak quite directly about our shared interests with the Philippines. Both countries benefit from effective cooperation on a variety of issues, including maritime security. But the President is certainly not going to pull any punches in raising well-documented and relevant concerns when it comes to human rights.\nQ: He's quite an unorthodox politician that can be quite unpredictable in some of the things that he says.\nMR. EARNEST: That's putting it mildly.\nQ: Is the White House preparing for this meeting in any way that's different from other bilateral meetings?\nMR. EARNEST: No, not particularly. I think the President's team has been interacting with their counterparts in the Philippines to set an agenda for the meeting. And I'm confident it will include some of the things that we've discussed both as it relates to maritime security, but also as it relates to some concerns that we have about the human rights situation inside the Philippines.\nQ: Josh, Canada has said that it is going to apply to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the AIIB.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. The international organization with the worst acronym in the world -- (laughter) -- the AIIB.\nQ: I'm wondering if Canada gave the United States a heads up about this, and how the White House feels about such a close ally doing this. And secondly, is there any chance that the United States is looking at joining?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that the United States and Canadian officials have been in touch on this issue. And what the United States has strongly advocated for are international institutions that are committed to high standards of governance and transparency. And when President Obama welcomed President Xi to the White House last fall, we announced a set of commitments that the Chinese had made with regard to ensuring that the AIIB met those high standards.\nWe know that Canada shares our view about the importance of transparency and good governance when it comes to these kinds of international institutions, and we're confident that when they -- as they join that organization and as they participate in those activities, they'll continue to be a strong advocate for that kind of governance. So, ultimately I think that's a good thing.\nI'm not aware of any plans right now that the United States has to join the AIIB, but if that changes we'll let you know.\nQ: Just another quick one on Trump. There's a report from NBC that the U.S. Embassy in Mexico has advised the Trump campaign against making the trip, or had previously advised them against making the trip. I'm wondering if you can confirm that that's true, and if so, if that's advice that the White House would overrule or has been in contact with or disagrees with in any way.\nMR. EARNEST: No, the White House is not offering any advice to the Trump campaign. And I can't speak to any communications between the embassy and the Trump campaign, so I'd refer you to my colleagues at the State Department for any details about those conversations.\nQ: And I noticed Mark wasn't the only one with a byline in the New York Times this morning. (Laughter.) So I wanted to ask about your op-ed, and, specifically, I think one reason that the White House might not be getting as much credit for transparency steps is sort of the notion that you're doing it for political gains as an implicit contrast with the Bush administration and with Hillary during the 2008 campaign. So I'm wondering if the principle of this is really important, why you've been reticent to call on the campaigns now to open up access to fundraisers or maintain the standards that you've hit.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me first clarify that what I submitted to the New York Times was merely a letter to the editor. I don't think that qualifies as a byline or even as an op-ed.\nQ: A signature line.\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, a signature line -- I'll take that. I'll take that.\nI think the letter to the editor largely speaks for itself, but I think you have raised an aspect of the argument that I think is important that I hope to surface with the letter, and it's simply this: I don't think there's a significant political benefit associated with transparency. I don't think there are that many voters that are out there saying, look, one of the reasons I'm going to vote for President Obama in this election is because he has kept his promise to maintain the most transparent administration in history. Voters, I think, are focused on other issues -- that's okay. That's not a criticism of voters; that is just an observation about the fact that people have other concerns on their minds.\nThere aren't a lot of people who are -- outside of the press corps -- who are checking out the WAVES records on a regular basis or reading the pool reports that you guys generate from the President's comments at fundraisers. There's not a large built-in constituency for transparency --\nQ: But this was an issue on the 2008 campaign. I mean, this is something that the President -- it was in his stump speech. So, like, let's not pretend that this wasn't a political issue to some extent, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me finish my answer and we can get to that. My point is, there is not a large constituency in the American electorate for transparency. The only constituency that exists for transparency in government are professional journalists. All of you are ardent advocates for government transparency, and you should be. That is a good thing. That is critical to the success of our democracy -- professional journalists who take their job very seriously to press for more access, to press for greater transparency, to hold people in power accountable.\nAnd so I think the point of my letter to the editor is simply that that is a valuable contribution that the U.S. media makes to the success of our democracy. That is why the White House Press Corps will continue to press every White House for more access and for more transparency. And failing to do so is failing to do your jobs.\nHowever, effective advocacy must remain credible, and preserving that credibility involves giving credit where it's due. There are steps that the Obama administration has taken that are historic, that are unprecedented, and that advance the cause of transparency. That does not mean that the press corps should stop pushing for access, but it does mean, in my view, that the press corps should recognize that progress where it has been made.\nThat is an entirely appropriate debate and conversation for us to have in a political context -- for us to have in the context of a presidential campaign. And, yes, that was part of the debate that we had in the context of the presidential campaign. But the President didn't make that argument because he expected that a lot of people would be voting for a candidate promising the most transparent administration in history. He incorporated his commitment to transparency in government as part of his stump speech because he wanted to communicate to the American public what his priorities were and what his vision is for the most effective way to lead the country. Transparency in government is part of that vision, it's part of his approach to good government. But I don't think there are voters out there who are pulling the lever for Obama or are going to pull the lever for other presidential candidates because of promises they're making about transparency.\nWhen it comes to offering advice to the campaigns, there are some built-in limitations that prevent me from offering all kinds of advice that I might have for presidential candidates. The responsibility that I have here is to be focused on government and the President's agenda and being attentive to the people's business. That is separate from campaign work.\nI think what I will just say in general is the President certainly hopes that the high standard for transparency that he set is continued by his successor, and the President is certainly hopeful that the next president will seek to build on the progress that we make when it comes to transparency.\nBut what is also true is there is no built-in political incentive for any politician to do that. It's going to require those journalists who devote the most time and attention to covering those activities to be effective and credible advocates for doing so. And part of that credibility involves giving those politicians credit where it's due.\nQ: So does President Obama hope to see the next President keep the visitor logs open, as he has had?\nMR. EARNEST: The President certainly hopes that all of -- that whoever his successor is is somebody who will not just maintain the high standard of transparency that he set, but will look for ways to build on it.\nQ: Specifically on the logs?\nMR. EARNEST: And that includes the WAVES records.\nQ: So, Josh, when you look at a number of specific things that the Democratic nominee that the President has endorsed is not doing that the President did do -- for instance, the fact that there's no protective pool covering her the way there is for the President and was during his campaign -- are you willing to describe that as a rollback from, as you described it, this high standard that the President has set? I mean, is there not a deterioration of that that we're already seeing? And if you can't call it for what it is, then how are we supposed to interpret that?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think what you should do is you should interpret it as me being quite limited in what I can say about the context of the campaign.\nQ: Why?\nMR. EARNERST: Well, again --\nQ: You talk about the campaign every day.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you guys talk about the campaign every day; I'm pretty careful about how I do that. And again, that is based on the responsibility that I have as a government servant, as a public servant. And my paycheck is paid for by the taxpayers and so I'm cautious about that.\nQ: Josh, would you mind checking with White House lawyers on -- obviously you have legitimate Hatch Act concerns, but could you check and see what might be acceptable to say about genuine policy issues as opposed to trying to pass judgment on one candidate or another?\nMR. EARNEST: Let me try to answer -- so I appreciate the acknowledgement. This is what I think that I do think that I can say, which is that the President does believe that all of you should make transparency an issue. This is a topic that's worthy of a political debate. And, again, I don't know how many voting decisions are going to be swayed by this debate, but it's one that's worth having and it's important for this to be part of the debate and something that all of you should scrutinize.\nBut, ultimately, how the campaigns respond to that is going to be their own decision based on their own analysis of the situation. And so I don't want to be a in a position of second-guessing that or even being perceived to be offering advice on that. But, I mean, whether it's tax returns or medical records or treatment of independent journalists, there are a variety of ways to evaluate how both candidates and their campaigns have performed on this measure. And I think the argument that I was making to Justin about the responsibility that independent journalists have to be advocates for transparency applies in this context too, which means giving credit where it's due, acknowledging differences where they exist, but continuing to press for more access and for more transparency and for more accountability. And that is an approach that all of you have taken when covering this White House, and I think it's entirely fair for you to pursue that same approach in covering the campaigns.\nQ: On a different subject. The Israelis this morning or late last night announced the approval of around -- well, hundreds of new settlement homes in the West Bank and retroactive approval of around 100 more. The White House, when the Israeli government does things like this, you routinely make statements along the lines of saying that this is deeply worrying and it makes a two-state solution less possible. Given that this keeps on happening despite your demotions, is it time for the White House to recalibrate its response and to increase the pain that Israel feels when it does things like this that you don't want them to do?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Andrew, let me start by saying something similar to what we have said before. This is not the first time that we have heard an announcement like this from the Israeli government. And this significant expansion of settlement activity poses a serious and growing threat to the viability of a two-state solution. We are particularly troubled by a policy of retroactively approving illegal outposts in unauthorized settlements.\nSo I think that we have been quite unambiguous about the concerns we have on this issue. And in terms of considering a different kind of response, I don't think that's something that we would discuss publically. I think we'd start by having that conversation privately.\nQ: I have one follow-up question from your briefing yesterday about Apple. And you explained the concerns of the United States about the EU acting unilaterally on tax policy. But I'm wondering how much of this you feel is going to be discussed at the G20 and whether you're thinking that this is going to overshadow some of the other things that maybe the United States had hoped to deal with at the G20.\nMR. EARNEST: Roberta, that is such a good question that I asked the same question earlier this morning. So what I will do is see if I can get some more information about exactly how this will be featured on the President's agenda at the G20, and see if I can give you some more detail about that in the context of tomorrow's gaggle.\nQ: Tomorrow morning?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. Will that be all right?\nQ: I guess so. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Anything else?\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Thanks, you guys.\nEND 11:58 A.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "Remarks as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119805", "text": "Wow. Thank you. That's a lot of people, Phoenix, that's a lot of people.\nThank you very much.\nThank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona.\nThe state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.\nNow, you know this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also. So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight. We're going to Arizona, OK?\nThis will be a little bit different. This won't be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.\nI've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much. And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.\nAnd, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.\nWe agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.\nWe also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we're all going to win. Both countries, we're all going to win.\nThis is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations. And, in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it's going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness.\nBut to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly.\nSadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them. The politicians won't talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.\nToday, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.\nLet me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn't serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\nThank you. But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it's impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.\nThese are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out. It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.\nThen there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people, so many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called Hillary Clinton.\nThis includes incredible Americans like 21 year old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered Federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies.\nHe was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona. A lot of you have known about Grant.\nHe was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.\nThen there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.\nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.\nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.\nOn top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.\nAnd this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.\nWhile there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.\nAnd they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.\nBut these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets.\nNot going to happen anymore, folks. November 8th. Not going to happen anymore.\nThe truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million.\nOur government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.\nFrankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.\nBut whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn't matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.\nOnly the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.\nTo all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well being of the American people.\nNothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.\nNo, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important.\nWe will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.\nThank you.\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. they support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. And, they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.\nHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.\nOn top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.\nMost incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan Horse. Watch what's going to happen, folks. It's not going to be pretty.\nThis includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?\nHard to believe. Hard to believe. Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan.And do you notice --\nAnd do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that. They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire. It's a tough one, she doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.\nWhile Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices, very great people. Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.\nI also worked with lawmakers, who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.\nNumber one, are you ready? Are you ready?\nWe will build a great wall along the southern border.\nAnd Mexico will pay for the wall.\nOne hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it. And they're great people and great leaders but they're going to pay for the wall. On day one, we will begin working on intangible, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.\nWe will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below.\nAbove and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.\nNumber two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.\nUnder my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.\nAnd they'll be brought great distances. We're not dropping them right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower. They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back. And across.\nThen when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances. But we will take them to the country where they came from, OK?\nNumber three. Number three, this is the one, I think it's so great. It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero.\nZero. They don't come in here. They don't come in here.\nAccording to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.\nNow, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect -- say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve. I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.\nThey live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.\nAnd you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone.\nBeyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over.\nThey're going out. They're going out fast.\nMoving forward. We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.\nWe will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.\nThat's over. That's over, folks. That's over.\nSince 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.\nMy plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about.\nBoth of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.\nThis is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders. None, none, none.\nHere's an interesting graphic from a study published this summer on voting attitudes among people who heard incumbents use restrictive rhetoric on immigration -- tough enforcement, no amnesty, deportations -- and its affect on their own opinions.\nOn my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle.\nTo ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong.\nAnd then we get them out.\nAnother reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.\nThe Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they will go face, believe me. They're going to go.\nWe're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.\nWithin ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK?\nMaybe they'll be able to deport her.\nThe local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast. And our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore. There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years, and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.\nWe're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.\nWho gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.\nAnd put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good. We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.\nI've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible.\nAnd getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. Means so much. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.\nNumber four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds.\nWe will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\nNumber five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\nWe will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million.\nAnd how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.\nHillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great.\nClinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.\nAnd don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States. Don't forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment. And don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.\nAnd don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets. They have been forgotten.\nClinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.\nCan you imagine? In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.\nAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.\nOur enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.\nNumber six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\nAccording to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we've ever had in the history of our country.\nOur country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out. And we have to straighten out fast.\nThe number is likely higher. But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress. As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized.\nHomeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.\nI call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good. It's extreme.\nAnd if people don't like it, we've got have a country folks. Got to have a country. Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria.We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. It's going to end badly folks. It's going to end very, very badly.\nFor the price of resettling, one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. Which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states. We don't want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.\nBut we will get the money from Gulf states and others. We'll supervise it. We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.\nAnother reform, involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people. And we will get the right people. An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.\nThank you. We're very proud of our country. Aren't we? Really? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That's what they say.\nThat's what they say. They're justified. Right? And we're admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. Attitudes on radical Islam, which our President refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully, none.\nNumber seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.\nThere are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won't take them back. So we say, OK, we'll keep them. Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.\nDue to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.\nAnd by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries.\nSecretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And, they would comply if we would act properly.\nIn other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't.\nThe result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place. Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.\nAccording to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. Hard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe.\nWe're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.\nThese 13,000 release occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.\nAnd, Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.\n(APPLAUSE)\nThose released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.\nThe Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation. We take them, we take them.\nNumber eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately. For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens. Never happens.\nHillary Clinton, all talk. Unfortunately when there is action it's always the wrong decision. You ever notice? In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place. And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system.\nApproximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should the? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.\nBeyond violating our laws, visa overstays, pose -- and they really are a big problem, pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and September in 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States expired visas.\nAnd, you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant?\nLast year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.\nIf people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.\nWe must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.\nNumber nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\nWe will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\nImmigration law doesn't exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life. The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.\nThat is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws.\nAnd the same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.\nTremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.\nNumber 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people. Workers. We're going to take care of our workers.\nAnd by the way, and by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to bring our jobs back home. We're going to bring our jobs back home.\nWe have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with NAFTA. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.\nWe're going to bring our jobs back home. And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them. It's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen. There will be consequences.\nWe've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true. But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.\nWe've had some big waves. And tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word. Integration and upward mobility.\nWithin just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.\nTo keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms. To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.\nWe take anybody. Come on in, anybody. Just come on in. Not anymore.\nYou know, folks, it's called a two-way street. It is a two-way street, right? We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. Remember, under a Trump administration it's called America first. Remember that.\nTo choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that in particular African- American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.\nAnd Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker, the Latino worker. She's going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on November eighth. And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years. That's what it is.\nShe is going to do nothing. And just look at the past. She's done nothing. She's been there for 35 years. She's done nothing. And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we're going to do together. Watch.\nYou watch. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old.\nTo avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They're archaic. They're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?\nSo let's now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump.\nI will get this done for you and for your family. We'll do it right. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above. And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear.\nAnd the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them, for once and for all.\nFor those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry --\nThank you. Thank you. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system -- and it will be an efficient system -- will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.\nWe will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.\nOur message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can't do it.\nThis declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over.\nImportantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time. And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.\nAnd the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.\nThat discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.\nRight now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security. Cut it off.\nWhether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing. And the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.\nThese are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. And do you notice, she doesn't answer.\nShe didn't go to Louisiana. She didn't go to Mexico. She was invited.\nShe doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again. Believe me.\nWhat we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won't like what you're hearing.\nThe result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.\nThis election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. November 8. November 8. You got to get out and vote on November 8.\nIt's our last chance. It's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that.\nSo I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for.\nI am going to ask -- these are really special people that I've gotten to know. I'm going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now. These are amazing women.\nThese are amazing people.\n(Family members speak individually.)\nThank you.\nThese are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that. I just think I've gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group. But they are incredible people and what they're going through is incredible, and there's just no reason for it. Let's give them a really tremendous hand.\nThat's tough stuff, I will tell you. That is tough stuff. Incredible people.\nSo, now is the time for these voices to be heard. Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.\nLet's fix this horrible, horrible, problem. It can be fixed quickly. Let's our secure our border.\nLet's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country. Let's protect our social security and Medicare. Let's get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.\nThis has been an incredible evening. We're going to remember this evening. November 8, we have to get everybody. This is such an important state. November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.\nWe're going to bring -- thank you, thank you. We're going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We're going to take our country back.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThis is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven't been looking to what's been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122621", "text": "Today, President Obama will speak at the 20th Anniversary of the Annual Lake Tahoe Summit about the importance of partnerships and innovation in tackling our shared climate and conservation challenges. The visit builds on other recent announcements, including the 100th anniversary of America's National Park Service, last week's designation of the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in north-central Maine, and the expansion of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument to create the world's largest marine protected area off the coast of Hawaii.\nLike the President's visit to the Alaskan Arctic last summer and Yosemite National Park earlier this summer, this visit to the Lake Tahoe region provides another vivid example of the new challenges we face as climate change threatens communities and ecosystems through impacts like increasingly frequent and severe drought and wildfires. In 2015, Lake Tahoe experienced its warmest average surface water temperature ever recorded and the west struggled with what may be the worst drought in more than 1,500 years. In keeping with the unique history of collaborative and innovative conservation efforts that have surrounded the Lake Tahoe region for more than two decades, today's announcements include a series of commitments to build upon the successful conservation legacy at Lake Tahoe, boost innovative approaches to conservation, and address threats to vulnerable communities at another of the region's key water bodies, the Salton Sea.\nAfter the Summit, the President will travel to Hawaii to address leaders from the Pacific Island Conference of Leaders and the IUCN World Conservation Congress, and Midway Atoll to highlight first-hand how the threat of climate change makes protecting our lands and waters more important than ever.\nBUILDING ON A SUCCESSFUL CONSERVATION LEGACY AT LAKE TAHOE\nAt the first Lake Tahoe Summit in 1997, President Bill Clinton – joined by Senator Reid as well as other key leaders from Nevada and California – jumpstarted a two-decades-long, successful partnership to restore Lake Tahoe's legendary water quality, and strengthen the region's economy for future generations. Since then, Federal, State, and local government partners have invested more than $1.8 billion into projects to restore wetlands, build transit facilities, upgrade roads to reduce polluted runoff, and reduce fire risks from nearby forests. Today, the Administration is building on this commitment with a number of conservation-focused actions impacting Lake Tahoe:\n•      Providing Hazardous Fuel Reduction Funding and Reducing Wildfire Risk:  The Department of the Interior is announcing $29.5 million dedicated for hazardous fuels reduction projects to improve forest health and protect life and property from the threat of catastrophic wildfires. The funding will be used on public and private lands to support the removal of standing dead and dying hazard trees along roads and in campgrounds, administrative sites, communication sites, and the wildland urban interface – adjacent to community infrastructure – in or adjacent to the Tahoe Basin. Since 2002, the Department of the Interior has invested more than $400 million in funding for over 400 projects in the Lake Tahoe Basin that support hazardous fuels treatments, restoration work and the acquisition of environmentally-sensitive lands.\n•      Investing in a Public-Private Partnership to Improve Watershed Health: The National Forest Foundation – working together with the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service and local community partners – is announcing that it has raised over $4 million for forest health, sustainable recreation and creek restoration projects throughout the Truckee River Watershed. This investment will increase the pace and scale of restoration in the region by expanding this effort to include adjoining watersheds as well as providing assistance in forming and facilitating the Tahoe West Collaborative.\n•      Supporting Improvements in Clean Water Infrastructure and Invasive Species Prevention: The Environmental Protection Agency is announcing more than $230,000 in grant funding for infrastructure to manage and reduce stormwater runoff in the region. The money will improve water quality in Lake Tahoe, which has been degraded by pollution from decades of uncontrolled stormwater runoff. In addition, the Fish and Wildlife Service is announcing nearly $1 million for eight projects to prevent the spread of invasive zebra and quagga mussels from nearby water bodies to Lake Tahoe. These invasive mussels could disrupt the natural balance of the Tahoe Basin ecosystem by degrading water quality and significantly reducing habitat for native species.\nBOOSTING INNOVATION FOR CONSERVATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE\nAmerica's lands and waters face growing challenges and increasing importance, especially from the impacts of climate change. In order to increase conservation efforts and meet these challenges, we must strengthen partnership and boost innovation – and, in turn, bring private capital off the sidelines. Built on the spirit of collaboration and innovation that first catalyzed Lake Tahoe's historic conservation efforts, the Administration is:\n•      Outlining a Strategy focused on \"Leveraging Innovation to Boost Private Investment in America's Natural Resources\": Today, the Administration released a strategy document outlining the potential for increased private investment in conservation to complement existing efforts to tackle the Nation's climate and conservation challenges, and opportunities for increasing investment by innovating across three areas: policy, finance, and technology. The strategy focuses on promoting policies that reward flexibility and outcome-focused conservation, financing methods to kick start new conservation markets, and technologies to unlock low-cost measurement and verification of conservation outcomes and enable collaboration across previously incomplete landscape-scales. Consistent with the strategy, the Administration is:\nØ      Setting a New Goal to Achieve $10 Billion Per Year in Support for Conservation from Private and Philanthropic Impact Investment: Estimated at approximately $230 million per year at the beginning of this Administration, private and philanthropic impact investment in conservation is increasing rapidly. In fact, a low estimate of current calendar year investment in the United States is approximately $1 billion. By focusing on the innovation strategy laid out by the Administration today, this investment stream can continue to scale.\nØ      Issuing New Guidance on Mitigating Impacts of Development and Incentivizing Greater Conservation: Building on President Obama's November 2015 memorandum that called for our economic development, infrastructure, and national security goals to be aligned with environmental preservation, the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service released a draft compensatory mitigation policy to help address the impacts of development on the nation's most at-risk species. The policy is the first comprehensive treatment of compensatory mitigation under authority of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to be issued by the Service.\nØ      Announcing Progress on First-of-a-Kind, Market-Based Conservation Approach: This week, the Department of the Interior signed an agreement with Newmont Mining Company to advance a first-of-its-kind mitigation credit system that will protect and restore sage grouse habitat. Along with an agreement signed with Barrick Gold Corporation earlier this year, these agreements highlight ways to enable important economic development while meeting our Nation's commitment to conservation.\nØ      Expanding Sensor Technology Challenge: The Environmental Protection Agency in collaboration with NOAA and USGS, is extending the  Nutrient Sensor Challenge to include transitioning new sensors, developed under the program, into the hands of state, local, academic and other users. Additionally, the agencies announced that they will expand the Challenge to include sensors for detection of harmful algal blooms in surface waters that are a direct result of excess nutrients next year.\nØ      Continuing to Support Innovative Finance for Water Infrastructure: Consistent with the goals outlined in the strategy issued today, EPA announced that it will publish a new playbook for financing non-traditional wastewater projects, like green infrastructure, water conservation, energy efficiency and nonpoint source protection. The playbook will describe examples of innovative financing currently utilized in some states and will highlight various financing options, such as State Revolving Fund assistance, fee programs, issuance of green bonds, watershed financing, interstate assistance, \"pay for success\" programs, and innovative partnerships.\n•      Making Progress through the National Drought Resilience Partnership: Today, the National Drought Resilience Partnership (NDRP), a cross-agency Federal partnership, released its first progress report. As of August 1, moderate to exceptional drought is impacting 20% of the United States and nearly 92.9 million people. In 2016, Secretary Vilsack issued Secretarial Drought Designations for all the counties in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The report outlines the work of the Federal partnership, such as co-investing $47 million through USDA and DOI to improve the water efficiency of farms an irrigation districts, and identifying rural communities most at risk for compromised drinking-water supplies as a result of drought, support of the National Rural Water Association (NRWA) and Rural Community Assistance Partnership (RCAP), providing technical assistance to rural communities and the water and wastewater utilities that serve them, including rural water services in California and Nevada.\nBUILDING A PATH FORWARD FOR THE SALTON SEA AND CLEAN ENERGY NATIONWIDE\nToday, the Administration is also announcing a package of actions to marshal strong partnership and innovation in support of the communities surrounding the Salton Sea, California's largest lake, which is facing a tipping point in environmental degradation. A 2014 study from the Pacific Institute, a global water think-tank, found that Californians could face $70 billion in costs, ranging from lower property values to dramatically higher health care costs for respiratory illness, if action is not taken to save the Sea. The actions today, in close partnership with the State of California, will support implementation of the State's Salton Sea Task Force Agency Action plan, help boost the region's climate resilience through innovative conservation approaches, spur economic growth by developing new clean energy resources, improve public health and provide a path forward for the Sea. The Administration is:\n•      Establishing a New Partnership Between the Federal Government and California to Accelerate Conservation in the Salton Sea: The State of California and the Department of the Interior (DOI) announced a new partnership that prioritizes long-term coordination between the State and Federal government that will facilitate prompt and informed decision-making regarding the future of the Salton Sea. This agreement will help to catalyze appropriate state and federal actions in addressing the natural resources and regional interests associated with the Salton Sea while recognizing the critical role that the Colorado River plays in providing water security for the State of California. Southern California relies on water from the Colorado River and from Northern California to augment limited local supplies. Consequently water supply reliability for a major part of America's economy is interconnected on progress in addressing long term drought on the Colorado River, environmental conditions at the Salton Sea and environmental conditions in California's Bay-Delta region. Each of these critical interconnected areas require a joint state and federal response to ensure success.\n•      Announcing a $10 Million Goal for Salton Sea Efforts with the Water Funder Initiative Foundations: Today, the Water Funder Initiative, a collaborative of leading philanthropic foundations including the S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation, the Energy Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Walton Family Foundation, announced a goal to provide $10 million over five years to support implementation of a comprehensive plan to protect public health and the environment, enhance drought resilience, and promote renewable energy and restoration at the Salton Sea. The funding could include loan guarantees, civil society support, private sector engagement, economic diversification programs, and other initiatives that benefit wildlife habitats and local communities.\n•      Advance Collaboration on Renewable Energy Development in the Imperial Valley/Salton Sea Area: The Department of Energy's (DOE) Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) has published a Request for Information (RFI) on identifying pathways for aggregating a power purchase between 100 and 250 MW of new geothermal energy from around the Imperial Valley's Salton Sea. The Imperial Valley is home to world-class renewable energy resources, with an existing capacity of over 6000 MW of renewables, and an estimated 1200 MW of additional geothermal resources that are currently untapped. This RFI will serve as a critical first step in exploring how Federal partners could aggregate demand to harness this existing and additional potential for meeting the nation's clean energy and sustainability goals, while ensuring that development balances with state and federal efforts to conserve the critical wildlife habitats in and around the Salton Sea. In addition, the Department of the Interior will soon finalize the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation plan, which will include provisions to help facilitate permitting of renewable energy and transmission projects in the Imperial Valley.\n•      Focusing on Technology Adoption and Breakthroughs to Boost the Salton Sea Economy and Clean Energy Generation: In addition to evaluating approaches to purchase clean power from the region, DOE is advancing technology adoption and breakthroughs by:\no      Convening Key Geothermal Experts for First-Ever Forum on Salton Sea Renewable Potential: DOE will lead a targeted, technical forum with the State of California, and the Geothermal Resources Council in October 2016 to accelerate development of geothermal energy resources in California, particularly around the Imperial Valley's Salton Sea. The forum will convene a diverse group of stakeholders from government, industry, and research to lay out solutions for new geothermal development while remaining consistent with critical Federal and state conservation planning efforts at the Salton Sea.\no      Investing in New Sources of Renewable Energy in the Region: DOE is announcing two projects selected for a total of up to $29 million for the pioneering Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE). Dedicated to cutting-edge research on enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), this field lab could unlock homegrown, geographically diverse, and carbon-free source of clean energy. After a competitive first phase of research, Sandia National Laboratories' Fallon, NV candidate site, and the University of Utah's candidate site in Milford, UT were selected for further development. The breakthroughs supported by this research can help improve the technical and economic feasibility of geothermal energy nationwide, including in the Salton Sea area, which features vast geothermal energy potential.\n•      Developing Innovative Partnerships Around Critical Watersheds: Today, the Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service is announcing that partnership agreements are being finalized with the Sierra Valley Conservation Planning Program and the Salton Sea Authority totaling more than $17 million for innovative partnerships that will help spur critical air, water, and wildlife habitat conservation planning for the Sierra Valley as well as the Salton Sea, in California. Partners to these agreements propose to contribute another $60 million, more than tripling the Federal investment.", "timestamp": "2016-08-31", "title": "Fact Sheet: At Lake Tahoe Summit, Obama Administration Underscores the Importance of Strong Partnerships and Innovation in Tackling our Shared Climate and Conservation Challenges"}

In his remarks, he referred to Landra Reid, wife of Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid, who introduced the President; and former Washoe Tribe Chairman A. Brian Wallace.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118843", "text": "The President. Hello, Tahoe! This is really nice. I will be coming here more often. My transportation won't be as nice—[laughter]—but I'll be able to spend a little more time here.\nFirst of all, I want to thank Harry Reid. And because he's a captive audience, he doesn't usually like people talking about him, but he's stuck here, and so I'm going to talk about him for a second. [Laughter]\nHarry grew up in a town that didn't have much: no high school, no doctor's office. Searchlight sure didn't have much grass to mow or many trees to climb. It didn't look like this. So when Harry discovered a lush desert oasis down the road called Piute Spring, he fell in love. And when Harry met Landra, his—the love of his life, he couldn't wait to take her there, but when he got to the green spring that Harry remembered, he was devastated to see that the place had been trashed. And that day, Harry became an environmentalist, and he's been working hard ever since to preserve the natural gifts of Nevada and these United States of America.\nSo Harry has protected fish and wildlife across the State. He helped to end a century-old water war. He created Nevada's first and only national park. Right after I took office, the very first act Harry's Senate passed was one of the most important conservation efforts in a generation. We protected more than 2 million acres of wilderness and thousands of miles of trails and rivers. That was because of Harry Reid. Last summer, thanks to Harry Reid's leadership, we protected more than 700,000 acres of mountains and valleys right here in Nevada, establishing the Basin and Range National Monument.\nTwo decades ago, the Senator from Searchlight trained a national spotlight right here, on Lake Tahoe. And as he prepares to ride off into the sunset, although I don't want him getting on a horse—[laughter]—this 20th anniversary summit proves that the light Harry lit shines as bright as ever. Now, in a few months, I'll be riding off into that same sunset. [Laughter]\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. No, it's true. It's okay. I mean, I'm still going to—I'm going to be coming around, I told you. I just won't have Marine One. [Laughter] I'll be driving.\nBut let me tell you, one of the great pleasures of being President is having strong relationships with people who do the right thing. They get criticized, they've got a tough job, but they get in this tough business because ultimately, they care about this country and they care about the people they represent. And that is true of Dianne Feinstein. That is true of Barbara Boxer. That is true of the outstanding Governor of California, Jerry Brown. That's true of our outstanding folks who work for the Department of Interior and work for the—[laughter]—who help look after our forests and help look after our national parks that help manage our water and try to conserve the wildlife and the birds and all the things that we want to pass on to the next generation.\nAnd so I'm going to miss the day-to-day interactions that I've gotten. And I'll miss Harry, even though he's not a sentimental guy. [Laughter] We were talking backstage. Anybody who's ever gotten on the phone with Harry Reid, you'll be mid-conversation, and once he's kind of finished with the whole point of the conversation, you'll still be talking and you realize he's hung up. [Laughter] And he does that to the President of the United States. [Laughter] And it takes you, like, three of four of these conversations to realize he's not mad at you—[laughter]—but he doesn't have much patience for small talk.\nBut Harry is tough. I believe he is going to go down as one of the best leaders that the Senate ever had. I could not have accomplished what I accomplished without him being at my side. So I want to say publicly, to the people of Nevada, to the people of Lake Tahoe, to the people of America: I could not be prouder to have worked alongside the Democratic leader of the Senate, Harry Reid. Give him a big round of applause.\nSo it's special to stand on the shores of Lake Tahoe. I have never been here.\nAudience members. Oooh!\nThe President. No, I haven't—look, it's not like I didn't want to come. [Laughter] Nobody invited me. [Laughter] I didn't know if I had a place to stay. So now that I have—I finally got here, I'm going to come back. And I want to come back not just because it's beautiful, not just because——\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. Well, not just because I love you back. [Laughter] Not just because \"The Godfather II\" is maybe my favorite movie. [Laughter] As I was flying over the lake, I was thinking about Fredo. [Laughter] It's tough. But this place is spectacular because it is one of the highest, deepest, oldest, and purest lakes in the world. It's been written that the lake's waters were once so clear that when you were out on a boat, you felt like you were floating in a balloon. Unless you were Fredo. [Laughter] It's been written that the air here is so fine, it must be \"the same air that the angels breathe.\"\nSo it's no wonder that for thousands of years, this place has been a spiritual one. For the Washoe people, it is the center of their world. And just as this space is sacred to Native Americans, it should be sacred to all Americans.\nAnd that's why we're here: to protect this special, pristine place; to keep these waters crystal clear; to keep the air as pure as the heavens; to keep alive Tahoe's spirit; and to keep faith with this truth, that the challenges of conservation and combating climate change are connected, they're linked. Now——\nAudience member. Keep fossil fuels in the ground.\nThe President. Okay.\nAudience member. Keep fossil fuels in the ground.\nThe President. I'm sorry, I——\nAudience member. Keep fossil fuels in the ground.\nThe President. I've got you, okay. I've got you. Thank you.\nAudience member. Thank you.\nThe President. That's a great banner. I'm about to talk about it though, so you're interrupting me.\nNow, I was going talk about climate change and why it's so important. You know, we tend to think of climate change as if it's something that's just happening out there that we don't have control over. But the fact is that it is manmade. It's not \"we think\" it's manmade. It's not \"we guess\" it's manmade. It's not \"a lot of people are saying\" it's manmade. It's not \"I'm not a scientist, so I don't know.\" You don't have to be a scientist. You have to read or listen to scientists to know that the overwhelming body of scientific evidence shows us that climate change is caused by human activity. And when we protect our lands, it helps us protect the climate for the future.\nSo conservation is critical not just for one particular spot, one particular park, one particular lake. It's critical for our entire ecosystem. And conservation is more than just putting up a plaque and calling something a park. We embrace conservation because healthy and diverse lands and waters help us build resilience to climate change. We do it to free more of our communities and plants and animals and species from wildfires and droughts and displacement. We do it because when most of the 4.5 million people who come to Lake Tahoe every year are tourists, economies like this one live or die by the health of our natural resources. We do it because places like this nurture and restore the soul. And we want to make sure that's there for our kids too.\nAs a former Washoe Tribe leader once said, \"The health of the land and the health of the people are tied together, and what happens to the land also happens to the people.\"\nSo that's why we've worked so hard—everybody on this stage, Harry's leadership, the work we've done in our administration—to preserve treasures like this for future generations. And we've proven that the choice between our environment, our economy, and our health is a false one. We've got to strengthen all of them together.\nIn the 20 years since President Clinton and Senator Reid started this summit, Federal, State, and local leaders have worked together to restore wetlands and habitats, improve roads, reduce pollution, and prevent wildfires. And that last point is especially important because of the severe drought that all of you know and you can see with your own eyes. A single wildfire in a dangerously flammable Lake Tahoe Basin could cause enough erosion to erase decades of progress when it comes to water quality. And the drought also endangers one of the epicenters of the world's food production in California.\nNow, a changing climate threatens even the best conservation efforts. Keep in mind, 2014 was the warmest year on record until, you guessed it, 2015. [Laughter] And now 2016 is on pace to be even hotter. For 14 months in a row now, the Earth has broken global temperature records. Lake Tahoe's average temperature is rising at its fastest rate ever, and its temperature is the warmest on record.\nAnd because climate and conservation are challenges that go hand in hand, our conservation mission is more urgent than ever. Everybody who is here, including those who are very eager for me to finish so that they can listen to the Killers——\nAudience members. [Applause]\nThe President. [Laughter] I've only got a few more pages. Our conservation effort is more critical, more urgent than ever. And we made this a priority from day one.\nWe, as Harry mentioned, protected more acres of public lands and water than any administration in history. Now, last week alone, we protected land, water, and wildlife from Maine to Hawaii, including the creation of the world's largest marine protected area. And, apropos of that young lady's sign, we've been working on climate change on every front. We've worked to generate more clean energy, use less dirty energy, waste less energy overall. In my first months in office, Harry helped America make the single largest investment in renewable energy in our history. Dianne Feinstein, Barbara Boxer have been at the forefront of this. Jerry Brown has been doing incredible legislative work in his State. These investments have helped drive down the cost of clean power so it's finally cheaper than dirty power in a lot of places. It helps us multiply wind power threefold, solar power more than thirtyfold. It's created tens of thousands of good jobs. It's adding to paychecks, subtracting from energy bills. It's been the smart and right thing to do.\nAnd then 1 year ago this month, we finalized a Clean Power Plan that spurs new sources of energy and gives States the tools to limit pollution that power plants spew into the sky. As I mentioned, last week, California passed an ambitious plan to cut carbon pollution. And, Jerry, I know you agree that more States need to follow California's lead.\nOn a national level, we've enacted tough fuel economy standards for cars, which means you're going to be able to drive further on a gallon of gas. It's going to save your pocketbook and save the environment. We followed that up with the first-ever standards for commercial trucks, vans, and buses. And as a consequence, during the first half of this year, carbon pollution hit its lowest level in a quarter century. And by the way, during the same time, we've had the longest streak of job creation on record. The auto industry is booming. There is no contradiction between being smart on the environment and having a strong economy, and we've got to keep it going.\nSo this isn't just a challenge, this is an opportunity. And today in Tahoe, we're taking three more significant steps to boost conservation and climate action. First, we're supporting conservation projects across Nevada to restore watersheds, stop invasive species, and further reduce the risks posed by hazardous fuels and wildfires. Number two, we're incentivizing private capital to come off the sidelines and contribute to conservation, because government can't do it alone. Number three, in partnership with California, we're going to reverse the deterioration of the Salton Sea before it is too late, and that's going to help a lot of folks all across the West.\nSo we're busy. [Laughter] And from here, I'm going to travel to my original home State of Hawaii, where the United States is proud to host the World Conservation Congress for the first time. Tomorrow I'm going to go to Midway to visit the vast marine area that we just created and to honor those who sacrificed their lives to protect our freedom. Then, I head to China, with whom we've partnered, as the world's two largest economies and two largest carbon emitters, to set historic climate targets that are going to lead the rest of the world to a cleaner, more secure future.\nSo just go back to that quote by the Washoe elder: \"It happens—what happens to the land also happens to the people.\" I've made it my—a priority in my Presidency to protect the natural resources we've inherited because we shouldn't be the last to enjoy them. Just as the health of the land and the people are tied together, just as climate and conservation are tied together, we share a sacred connection with those who are going to follow us. I think about my two daughters. I think about Harry's 19 grandchildren. [Laughter] He's been—yes, that's a lot of grandkids. [Laughter] The future generations who deserve clear water and clean air that will sustain their bodies and sustain their souls, jewels like Lake Tahoe.\nAnd it's not going to happen without hard work. It sure is not going to happen if we pretend a snowball in winter means nothing is wrong. It's not going to happen if we boast about how we're going to scrap international treaties or have elected officials who are alone in the world in denying climate change or put our energy and environmental policies in the hands of big polluters. It's not going to happen if we just pay lip service to conservation, but then refuse to do what's needed.\nWhen scientists first told us that our planet was changing because of human activity, it was received as a bombshell, but in a way, we shouldn't have been surprised. The most important changes are always the changes made by us. And the fact that we've been able to grow our clean energy economy proves that we have agency, we've got power. Diminishing carbon pollution proves we can do something about it. Our healing of Lake Tahoe proves it's within our power to pass on the incredible bounty of this country to a next generation. Our work isn't done.\nAnd so after I leave office and Harry leaves office and Barbara—she's going to be right alongside us, on a slightly smaller horse—[laughter]—because she's got to get up on top of it—after we've all left office, the charge to continue to make positive change is going to be in all of our hands, as citizens. I always say the most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen. Change happens because of you. Don't forget that.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-08-31", "title": "Remarks at the 20th Annual Lake Tahoe Summit in Stateline, Nevada"}

These individuals are our family members, friends, and neighbors, and when they are not able to get the help they need, our communities and our country are not as strong as they can be. It is up to all of us to help our loved ones seek life-saving services when needed and steer them toward recovery. Throughout this month, we celebrate the successes of all those who know the transformative power of recovery, and we renew our commitment to providing the support, care, and treatment that people need to forge a healthier life.\nSubstance use disorder, commonly known as addiction, is a disease of the brain, and many misconceptions surrounding it have contributed to harmful stigmas that can prevent individuals from seeking the treatment they need. By treating substance use disorders as seriously as other medical conditions, with an emphasis on prevention and treatment, people can recover. This month's theme is, \"Join the Voices for Recovery: Our Families, Our Stories, Our Recovery!\". Focusing on the importance of family support throughout recovery, it invites families, loved ones, and other individuals to share their stories and triumphs in fighting substance use disorders to inspire others that may follow in their footsteps. I encourage all Americans looking for assistance to use the \"Treatment Locator\" tool at www.SAMHSA.gov or call 1-800-662-HELP.\nThis disease can touch any American in any community, and my Administration has made combatting substance use disorders a priority. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies must now cover substance use disorder services as essential health benefits. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act requires health plans that cover mental health and substance use disorder treatment to provide coverage that is comparable to that of medical and surgical care. Through our National Drug Control Strategy—a 21st century approach to reducing drug use and its consequences—we have promoted evidence-based health and safety initiatives that aim to prevent drug use, increase opportunities for early intervention and integrated treatment in health care, and support recovery. In response to our Nation's opioid overdose epidemic, we are highlighting tools that can help reduce drug use and overdose, such as evidence-based prevention programs, prescription drug take-back events, medication-assisted treatment for people with opioid use disorders, and the overdose reversal drug naloxone. That is why, in my most recent budget proposal, I proposed investing $1 billion to expand access to treatment for prescription opioid misuse and heroin use. I will continue urging the Congress to fund treatment like I have proposed—because if they fund these efforts, we can help more individuals across our country seek help, complete treatment, and sustain recovery.\nDuring National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, let us thank health care professionals, support groups, and all those dedicated to helping individuals in need find assistance and reclaim their lives. Let us continue working to address substance use disorders in our communities and promote the health, safety, and prosperity of the American people.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-08-31", "title": "Proclamation 9479—National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2016"}

But collaborative efforts in recent years have helped our Nation make progress and begin to reverse these trends. By fostering environments that support healthy choices and giving families the knowledge and resources they need to make smart decisions, we can move closer toward ensuring all our children grow up healthy. Every September, as children begin the new school year, we recommit to solving the epidemic of childhood obesity within the next generation.\nOver the course of my Presidency, we have put forward new programs, policies, and initiatives that put children on a path to a healthy future. At the launch of First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative, I established the first-ever Task Force on Childhood Obesity to develop a national action plan to mobilize the public and private sectors and engage families and communities in an effort to improve the health of our children. Combining comprehensive strategies with common sense, Let's Move! is focused on helping children lead a healthier life during their earliest months and years; providing healthier foods in our schools; ensuring every family has access to healthy, affordable food; and getting children to become more physically active. Everyone has a role to play in ensuring all of our kids grow up healthy, including parents and caregivers, elected officials from all levels of government, schools, health care professionals, faith-based and community-based organizations, and the private sector. For the past 5 years we have welcomed students to the White House from across our Nation to create original and healthy recipes in our annual Healthy Lunchtime Challenge and Kids' \"State Dinner.\" The First Lady has also invited students to join her in planting and harvesting the White House Kitchen Garden to learn about where their food comes from and experience firsthand how healthy food can be fun and delicious.\nEarlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration introduced a modernized Nutrition Facts label—which includes more realistic serving sizes and information on added sugars—to provide families with the accurate information they need to make healthy choices. We know there is a strong connection between what our kids eat and how well they perform in school, too. That is why, in 2010, I signed the bipartisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, a law that improves the quality of school meals and snacks for over 50 million students so they have the fuel they need to focus on their education and grow up healthy. A recent study showed that because of the increased availability and variety of fruits and vegetables in school meals, students have been empowered to make healthier choices since these standards were updated. The Act increased the number of students who could get school meals at little or no cost and ensured that any food or beverage marketed to children at school meets specific nutrition standards. It also helped bring about the first major revision of nutrition standards for the Child and Adult Care Food Program since its inception more than 40 years ago.\nIn addition to improving the nutrition of the food our children eat, we will keep striving to create opportunities for kids to become more physically active. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that kids be active for at least 60 minutes every day, but less than one-third of teenagers have met that goal in recent years. Last year, the Surgeon General called on communities to recognize the importance of exercise by walking more and by improving the walkability of our neighborhoods. Through our \"Every Kid in a Park\" initiative, we have opened up our National Parks to fourth graders and their families for free, so that children from all backgrounds, parts of the country, and walks of life can get outdoors more easily.\nThis year, as we observe National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month, let us renew our commitment to giving America's daughters and sons a healthy start in life. Let us continue to encourage parents and caregivers to make nutritious choices and help their children do the same, improve access to healthy and affordable foods in our communities and our schools, and promote active lifestyles. We must each do our part to reduce childhood obesity and empower our children to reach for the brighter, healthier future they deserve.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month. I encourage all Americans to learn about and engage in activities that promote healthy eating and greater physical activity by all our Nation's children.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-08-31", "title": "Proclamation 9480—National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month, 2016"}

Fifteen years after the attacks of September 11, we reflect on our strength as a Nation when anything threatens us. Today, as the residents of Louisiana mourn the loss of loved ones and face tremendous damage caused by historic floods, we are reminded of what Americans do in times like these—we see the power of love and community among neighbors who step up to help in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. Preparing ourselves to meet the unknown challenges of tomorrow is a duty we all share, and when confronted with crisis or calamity, we need to have done everything possible to prepare. During National Preparedness Month, we emphasize the importance of readying ourselves and our communities to be resilient in the face of any emergency we may encounter.\nAlthough my Administration continues doing everything we can to keep the American people safe, it is each citizen's responsibility to be as prepared as possible for emergencies. Whether in the form of natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes, or unspeakable acts of evil like terrorism, danger can arise at unexpected times and places. Fortunately, there are many things that individuals, families, and communities can do to improve their readiness. I encourage all Americans to take proactive steps to prepare for any situation that may occur—including signing up for local alerts, checking insurance coverage, documenting valuables, creating a plan for emergency communication and evacuation, and having a fully stocked disaster supply kit on hand. And I encourage those in the business community to prepare their employees, develop a business continuity plan, and engage in community-level planning to help ensure our communities and private sector remain strong when faced with an emergency. For information on how to better prepare for emergencies that are common in your area, or to learn about resources that may be available for increasing preparedness, visit www.Ready.gov or www.Listo.gov.\nIn the face of unpredictable threats and hazards, we are committed to improving access to information and raising awareness of the importance of precautionary measures. Leaders across our country should take the time to review the 2016 National Preparedness Report and find ways to address the vulnerabilities it highlights. All Americans can play a role in fulfilling our National Preparedness Goal by addressing the risks that affect them and participating in preparedness activities across our Nation.\nWe continue to collaborate with State, local, and tribal partners, along with those in the public and private sectors, to ensure that communities in crisis do not have to face these dangers alone. In addition to coordinating relief efforts and providing rapid response, we have focused on supporting the needs of survivors, investing in affected neighborhoods, and helping them rebuild their communities to be better, stronger, and more resilient. Federal agencies are also working to share resources with the public, promote the tools and technologies that could help during disasters, and offer preparation strategies. We launched America's PrepareAthon! to bring communities together and help them plan for emergencies, and on September 30, we encourage a national day of action to spur preparedness efforts from coast to coast.\nDisasters have become more frequent and severe as our climate changes; both urban and rural areas are already feeling the devastating consequences, including severe droughts and higher sea levels, intense storms and wildfires, and more powerful hurricanes and heat waves. Climate change poses an imminent and lasting threat to our safety and national security, and it is critical that we invest in our infrastructure and integrate the preparedness efforts of our communities to improve our ability to respond to and recover from the effects of our changing climate and extreme weather events.\nThis month, we pay tribute to the courageous individuals who rush to the scene of disaster for their dedication to our safety and security, no matter the price. Let us recognize that each of us can do our part to prepare for emergencies, help those affected by disasters, and ensure all our people have the necessary resources and knowledge to protect themselves. Together, we will remain strong and resilient no matter what befalls us.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Preparedness Month. I encourage all Americans to recognize the importance of preparedness and work together to enhance our resilience and readiness.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-08-31", "title": "Proclamation 9481—National Preparedness Month, 2016"}

Today, protected wild spaces continue to serve as a backdrop for curious and adventurous Americans to seek the thrill and joy of connecting with the sacred spirit of our country's wilderness, offering a wide variety of activities including hiking, camping, and climbing. This month, as we cherish our vast and vibrant natural heritage, we resolve to preserve its splendors for all who will follow in our footsteps.\nAiming to leave future generations with a \"glimpse of the world as it was in the beginning,\" President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law two historic pieces of legislation that opened a new chapter in American conservation—the Wilderness Act and the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. The Wilderness Act defined our untrammeled lands as wilderness and created the National Wilderness Preservation System, recognizing forests, parks, and wildlife refuges as having intrinsic value as wild lands worth protecting. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) was established out of a bipartisan commitment to ensure that we can protect lands and waters for use and enjoyment by all our people; throughout the last 50 years it has supported conservation efforts in every State, including tens of thousands of State and local projects through billions of dollars in grants. But a lack of full and secure funding hinders many important LWCF projects that protect critical habitats and provide recreational opportunities—which is why I keep calling on the Congress to pursue permanent funding for the LWCF.\nOur great outdoors are home to some of the richest and most beautiful ecosystems and resources on the planet, and my Administration has made protecting them a priority. Climate change, one of the greatest challenges of our time, is already harming many of our wild spaces, which is one important reason why I have pushed for stronger action to cut greenhouse gas pollution and strengthen the resilience of our ecosystems to rising temperatures. In my first year in office, I signed the most extensive expansion of conservation efforts in more than a generation. Since then, my Administration has protected hundreds of millions of acres of land and water, more than any Administration in history. Through our America's Great Outdoors initiative, we have worked with local, State, and tribal partners to build a conservation agenda worthy of the 21st century. And to ensure more Americans can experience everything the wilderness has to offer, we launched the \"Every Kid in a Park\" initiative, giving fourth graders and their families free entrance to our National Parks and other public lands and waters.\nIt is one of our greatest responsibilities as citizens of this Nation and stewards of this planet to protect these outdoor spaces of incomparable beauty and to ensure that this powerful inheritance is passed on to future generations. During National Wilderness Month, let us strengthen our connection with these natural treasures and ensure that the stories they tell and the resources they provide are resilient and everlasting in the years to come. Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2016 as National Wilderness Month. I invite all Americans to visit and enjoy our wilderness areas, to learn about their vast history, and to aid in the protection of our precious national treasures.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-08-31", "title": "Proclamation 9482—National Wilderness Month, 2016"}

He also referred to Proclamation 9478, signed August 25, which expanded the existing Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118848", "text": "The President. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, welcome to Hawaii. [Laughter] It's a——\nAudience members. Aloha!\nThe President. Aloha! [Laughter] You know, it's not often I get to welcome folks to my home State. But it's always wonderful to be here, even if it's only for a day. It's even rarer that not one but two hurricanes are set to pass through the islands over the next few days. [Laughter] So we've been working with the Governor and FEMA to make sure Hawaii's got everything it needs to keep our folks safe. And in the meantime, I'd just ask the people of Hawaii to listen to your State and local officials, and make sure you and your families are prepared for the storms. But the Governor says he's got it all taken care of. He's pushing them all south. And—[laughter].\nI want to thank East-West Center President Charles Morrison for hosting all of us this evening. I want to recognize, in addition to the Governor, we also have Senator Brian Schultz—Schatz here. Where is Brian? There he is. I want to thank the 8,000 delegates from more than 180 countries who will share their expertise here at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, including President Zhang Xinsheng and Director General Andersen. To the world leaders and ministers who are here from the Pacific Island Conference of Leaders, thank you for joining us tonight. And I know many of you will be in Washington next month when Secretary Kerry hosts our 2016 Our Oceans Conference.\nBut today the United States is proud to host the IUCN Congress for the first time. I just came here from another beautiful place: Lake Tahoe, Nevada. And in my address there, I talked about climate change and conservation and how those two things are inextricably linked. Few people understand, I think, the stakes better than our Pacific Island leaders because they're seeing already the impact. Rising temperatures and sea levels pose an existential threat to your countries. And while some Members of the U.S. Congress still seem to be debating whether climate change is real or not, many of you are already planning for new places for your people to live. Crops are withering in the Marshall Islands. Kiribati bought land in another country because theirs may someday be submerged. High seas forced villagers from their homes in Fiji.\nAnd no nation, not even one as powerful as the United States, is immune from a changing climate. I saw it myself last year in our northernmost State of Alaska, where the sea is already swallowing villages and eating away at shorelines; where the permafrost thaws and the tundra is burning; where glaciers are melting at a pace unprecedented in modern times. And it was a preview of our future if the climate keeps changing faster than our efforts to address it.\nAnd that's why I've devoted so much of my time and my energy to making sure that we get this right while we still have time. I spoke about this at length in a speech earlier today, but over the past 7½ years, America has worked to generate more clean energy, use less dirty energy, and waste less energy overall. And it's made a difference. Our investments have tripled wind power, multiplied solar power thirtyfold, and in many places, helped clean energy become cheaper than dirty energy. And we did all of this while fueling the longest uninterrupted streak of job growth on record.\nSo there's no conflict between a healthy economy and a healthy planet. And that's why I've committed, along with Canada and Mexico, to get 50 percent of U.S. electricity from clean sources by 2025. And with many of our biggest businesses switching to clean energy, I'm absolutely confident that we can meet that goal.\nBut that's not all. I've also made sure we're better prepared for the impacts of climate change, because even as we need to hit the brakes so that we don't go over the cliff, we're not going to come to an immediate stop. We know that there is still going to be an inevitable impact as a consequence of rising temperatures. And that means conservation has been a cornerstone of my Presidency.\nSince taking office, I've protected more than 548 million acres of our lands and waters for our children and our grandchildren. I have to say that Teddy Roosevelt gets the credit for starting the National Parks system, but when you include a big chunk of the Pacific Ocean, we now have actually done more acreage—[laughter]—than any other President. We've designated national monuments from Maine to Ohio to California. And just last week, thanks to the hard work of many people in this room, including Senator Schatz, I created the world's largest marine preserve, quadrupling the size of our monument at Papahānaumokuākea. This is an area twice the size of Texas that's going to be protected, and it allows us to save and study the fragile ecosystem threatened by climate change.\nTomorrow I'm going to travel to the Midway Atoll to see it for myself. Seven thousand species live in its waters, a quarter of which are not found anywhere else in the world. Ancient islanders believed it contained the boundary between this life and the next. Hundreds of brave Americans gave their lives there in defense of the world's freedom. So this is a hallowed site, and it deserves to be treated that way. And from now on, it will be preserved for future generations.\nSo I'm very proud of these achievements, but we always have to remind ourselves no nation can do this alone. We're going to have to tackle climate change together. Nations like many of yours obviously feel a special urgency about this. The biggest emitters, like my country and China, have a special responsibility to act to make sure that countries willing to do their part move past the dirty phase of development to move into a clean energy strategy. That was a key principle in the Paris Agreement. And I was mentioning to the leaders here, we could not have gotten a Paris Agreement without the incredible efforts and hard work of the island nations. They made an enormous difference, and we're very proud of the work that they did.\nAnd this is why we've been working to accelerate public-private clean energy innovation, making sure that resources will be there for countries that need help preparing for the impacts of climate change that we can no longer avoid. It's also why tonight I can announce more than $30 million in new commitments for our friends in the Pacific: funding for investments like stronger infrastructure, more sustainable development, and safer drinking water. So—[applause].\nFrom here I'm going to be traveling to China, where we'll be meeting for the G-20 summit, and climate will be a centerpiece of our agenda. Joint U.S.-Chinese leadership on climate was part of the reason that we were able to get Paris done, and I'm going to push to build on that record as long as I occupy this office and probably even after I leave it. There's an old Hawaiian proverb that loosely translates to \"Unite to move forward.\" It seems simple enough, but the natives used it as a reminder that if you want to row a canoe, every oar has to be moving in unison; otherwise, I don't know, you go in circles. [Laughter] You just go around and around. Your pace slows. You drift. You get caught up in the currents, and you get off course.\nWell, when it comes to climate change, there is a dire possibility of us getting off course, and we can't allow that to happen. That's why our united efforts are so important. Government has a role to play but so do scientists and inventors and investors, all working to revolutionize clean energy production. Entrepreneurs and academics and leaders in this room are collaborating across continents. And everyday citizens of the world are going to have to push their own communities to adopt smarter practices and to push those of us in positions of power to be less concerned with special interests and more concerned about the judgment of future generations.\nAnd that's why we're all here. That's what this is all about. And for me, this is especially meaningful. I was telling my staff, a lot of my life started about a mile radius around here. [Laughter] My mother and father met probably a couple hundred yards from here. [Laughter] It's true. I went to school about a mile from here. I was actually born about a mile from here. [Laughter] My grandmother and my grandparents lived most of their lives a short way away from here.\nAnd so since Malia was born, since my oldest child was born, I've brought them here every Christmas for the last 18 years now. And I want to make sure that when they're bringing their children here or their grandchildren here, that they are able to appreciate the wonders and the beauty of this island and of the Pacific and every island.\nSo I know you have the same feeling, and that's why we've got to unite to move forward. We have to row as one. If we do, we might just save the one planet that we've got.\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-08-31", "title": "Remarks at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress in Honolulu, Hawaii"}
