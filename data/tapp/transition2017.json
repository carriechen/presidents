After a major financial crisis, it should not be surprising that some unfortunate individuals lost jobs, suffered other tragedies, and were not able to repay their mortgages on any terms; those foreclosures are human tragedies. But the real story here is how much better OneWest was at saving homes than most banks. Government reviews show that OneWest offered more than 100,000 loan modifications to delinquent borrowers, as well as that those loan modifications included more principal forgiveness than any similarly sized bank. Importantly, when foreclosure was the only option, OneWest made mistakes far less often than others in the industry.\" - Walter Mix, Former Commissioner of the California Department of Financial Institutions, Letter to the Senate Finance Committee, 1/12/16\n\"A 2011 audit by the FDIC Office of Inspector General found that OneWest properly administered these loan-modification requirements \"more than 98 percent of the time.\" The remaining 93% of the loans were owned by investors, tied up mostly in securitization trusts. For these, implementing similar loan-modification terms as those required by the FDIC would have required investors' consent….Ultimately, the facts around the IndyMac failure and sale are clear. IndyMac was felled by a toxic mix of bad underwriting, aggressive growth and high-cost funding, which made it a uniquely unappealing bank that was going to cost the FDIC a lot of money no matter who bought it. Simply put, it was sold to a buyer who was willing to pay more than any other after an open and fair competitive bidding process in a highly distressed market environment. This, in the end, lowered the FDIC's losses.\" - Jim Wigand, former deputy director of the FDIC's Division of Resolution and Receiverships and John Bovenzi, former deputy to the FDIC chairman former CEO of IndyMac during its conservatorship, Wall Street Journal, 1/18/17\n\"In the IndyMac transaction, to my knowledge, Mr. Mncuhin and the investors adhered to all aspects of the FDIC's requirements, persevered through months and months of anguish and negotiations, and did what even the FDIC had not expected. They invested $1.3 billion of their own cash to acquire the entire bank at the least cost to the government, earning the right to keep it open for business for the benefit of its customers, employees and new shareholders.\" - Thomas Vartanian, former General Counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and FSLIC, Letter to the Senate Finance Committee, 1/12/17", "timestamp": "2017-01-19", "title": "Press Release - Regulators Heap Praise on Mnuchin"}

Attorney General McDaniel cites the bipartisan effort put forth by Attorney General Pruitt to improve the water quality of the Illinois River watershed as a specific example for why he will be the perfect fit to promote President-elect Trump's environmental agenda, putting the American people and their environment first.\nThe Full Text of the Letter Can Be Read Below\nJanuary 18, 2017\nThe Honorable John Barrasso\nChairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works\n410 Dirksen Senate Office Building\nWashington, D.C. 20510\nThe Honorable Tom Carper\nRanking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works\n456 Dirksen Senate Office Building\nWashington, D.C. 20510\nRe: Attorney General Scott Pruitt's Nomination To Serve As Director of the Environmental Protection Agency\nDear Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member Carper, and Members of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee,\nMy name is Dustin McDaniel. I am an attorney in Little Rock, Arkansas. I served as the Democratic Attorney General of the State of Arkansas from 2007-2015. During that time, I served for three years as the Co-Chair of the Democratic Attorneys General Association. I am a member of the Democratic National Committee and was a strong supporter of Secretary Clinton's campaign for President. I am grateful for your work on this committee. I believe in the core mission of the Environmental Protection Agency. I believe that climate change is real and overwhelmingly the result of human activity. I believe that the United States has a moral obligation to lead the world in shaping climate policy. These challenges in a hostile political environment will be acutely felt by the next director of the EPA.\nAs you consider the nomination of my friend Scott Pruitt, I respectfully ask that you enter this letter into the record so that I may attempt to clarify what I believe to be unfair criticisms of the historic agreement negotiated between myself on behalf of the State of Arkansas and Attorney General Pruitt on behalf of the State of Oklahoma regarding water quality in the Illinois River watershed.\nPrior to the elections of General Pruitt or myself, Oklahoma grappled with Arkansas municipal water systems and Arkansas industry, primarily poultry companies, over increased phosphorous levels in the Illinois River watershed. Pollution was substantially impacting the water quality in one of Oklahoma's most scenic waterways. In 2003, an agreement was executed between the states that would require that the phosphorus levels be reduced over the next 10 years to a level .037 parts per million. As a result, the states all parties in both sides of the state line worked diligently to substantially improve the water quality.\nAt the same time, then-Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson filed suit using an out of state plaintiffs firm against Arkansas's poultry industry. Many criticized the litigation as taking the focus away from the environment and placing it on money damages. The State of Oklahoma's outside counsel presented their case to U.S. District Court Judge Gregory Frizzell. Almost all of the claims were dismissed by the court. The evidence was fully submitted to the judge in March of 2010 on the remaining question regarding injunctive relief. To this day, no ruling in that litigation has been handed down.\n2013, the ten-year deadline on the phosphorus level, was approaching, two things were evident: 1.) despite huge improvements in water quality, the bosporus level in the river would not be at .037 parts per million before the deadline, and 2.) research into the standard itself revealed that it was based on compromise positions rather than by hard science.\nThe States of Arkansas and Oklahoma were facing a point of litigating against one another (again) over this issue to the detriment of all concerned. I approached General Pruitt to ask if we could reach a solution that would protect the environment and demonstrate to our citizens that we were committed to working together on their behalf rather than litigating against one another using taxpayer dollars for lawyers instead of scientists.\nThe resulting agreement reflects that Oklahoma enhanced, not relaxed, its enforcement of environmental protection. Scientists were appointed to establish the proper water quality metrics, and at no time were the phosphorous abatement measures relaxed. It was an historic moment that demonstrated that cooperation in pursuit of environmental protection yielded better results than litigation. The resulting report was recently released from the commission and is available for your review.\nRecent press accounts regarding these efforts unfairly miss characterize the work that was done by General Pruitt and his team. He was a staunch defender of sound science and good policy as the appropriate tools to protect the environment of his state. I saw firsthand how General Pruitt was able to bridge political divides and manage multiple agency agendas to reach an outcome that was heralded by most credible observers as both positive and historic.\nAs I am sure that this committee will have questions about this matter, I wanted to take this opportunity to add facts and context to an accomplishment that should stand as a credit to General Pruitt's career and qualifications for this nomination.\nI sincerely appreciate the opportunity to submit this letter to you and to your committee and to be a part of the record in these proceedings. I thank you for your service to our nation.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDustin McDaniel", "timestamp": "2017-01-18", "title": "Press Release - Former Democratic Attorney General Endorses Scott Pruitt for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency"}

Phil Gingrey (R-GA)\nJanuary 17th, 2017\nClick Here to Read\nAs a physician and former member of the House of Representatives from 2003 to 2014, I am very pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's selection of my friend, fellow Georgian and former colleague Dr. Tom Price to serve as his secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).\nNot since President George H.W. Bush picked Dr. Louis Sullivan as the 17th HHS secretary in 1989 have we had such a uniquely qualified individual and healthcare professional to lead this huge and tremendously important department of our federal government.\nRunning an agency the size and scope of HHS requires many things: a strong understanding and appreciation of the nation's healthcare system, knowledge of the myriad other issues and agencies under the HHS umbrella, strong leadership and management skills, deep intellect, a capacity for learning and listening, creative problem-solving, and a willingness to try new things.\nPrice brings all of these characteristics to the job and certainly his well-recognized work ethic, knowledge of both policy and process, and commitment to improving the nation's healthcare system are some of the principal reasons Trump tapped him to fill this crucial Cabinet position.\n...\nPrice has always led by example and being action- and solution-oriented, puts policy proposals forward. For example, during the healthcare reform debate in 2010, he introduced the Empowering Patients First Act. His legislation was intended to serve as a Republican alternative to the Democrats' bill, but it eventually was positioned as a potential replacement of the enacted Affordable Care Act.\n...\nThe secretary of HHS needs to be someone thoughtful, knowledgeable, respected, trusted and able to solve problems. Price exceeds these job requirements.\nI hope the Senate quickly confirms him as secretary so the nation can begin to see what his patients, constituents and congressional colleagues all know: that he is a compassionate, competent and smart man who will help steer the nation's largest healthcare agency through a period of change with a steady hand on the rudder.", "timestamp": "2017-01-17", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: The Hill: Nominee Tom Price is the Doctor HHS Needs"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=49672", "text": "Today, nominee for United States Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin received a letter of support from Faith Schwartz, the former Executive Director of HOPE NOW, an organization dedicated to working with a broad sector of stakeholders committed to addressing challenges in the mortgage market and helping homeowners avoid foreclosure. Ms. Schwartz, who wrote a letter to Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Orrin Hatch and Ranking Member Ron Wyden, cited federal data showing that OneWest Bank, under Mr. Mnuchin's leadership, helped tens of thousands of borrowers stay in their homes by offering principal forgiveness and other forms of loan modifications.\n\"I am immensely grateful for the support of Faith Schwartz, a leading voice for homeowners during the housing crisis,\" said Steven Mnuchin. \"If confirmed, I look forward to listening to the concerns of the American people and working to make sure families never face another crisis like they did in 2008.\"\nFull text of the letter can be read below:\nDear Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden:\nI write in connection with the nomination of Steven Mnuchin to be Secretary of the Treasury. I do not know Mr. Mnuchin, but as the former executive director of the HOPE NOW Alliance, I am intimately familiar with the loan modification and home retention programs of OneWest Bank, which have played such a prominent role in the media coverage of Mr. Mnuchin's nomination. I therefore wanted to make sure that the Committee has accurate facts as it considers this important nomination.\nHOPE NOW is a voluntary alliance between counselors, mortgage companies, investors, regulators, and other mortgage market participants created in 2007 with the strong encouragement of the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. HOPE NOW brought together diverse stakeholders to collaborate to address challenges in mortgage servicing and to assist at-risk homeowners. Since 2007, HOPE NOW has played an important role in facilitating more than six million loan modifications and other foreclosure avoidance solutions for homeowners. I was proud to lead the organization from its inception during the financial crisis through early 2013.\nAlthough the government encouraged the creation of HOPE NOW, membership is purely voluntary and not all banks and mortgage companies joined the alliance. Under Mr. Mnuchin's leadership, however, OneWest Bank joined early and took an active and leading role in rolling out homeowner assistance programs to its borrowers. In fact, OneWest was an early adopter of numerous voluntary loan modification programs, reflecting both the company's cultural commitment to home retention and Mr. Mnuchin's personal commitment to the FDIC to vigorously pursue foreclosure avoidance options wherever possible. For example, OneWest was one of the first banks to adopt the Principal Reduction Alternative, an optional part of the federal HAMP program under which participating servicers reduced borrower principal (nonparticipating institutions only reduced borrower interest rates, which was found to be a less sustainable model for borrowers who loan balances exceeded their property value). OneWest also was an early adopter of the 2MP program, which allowed servicers to modify qualifying second mortgages. OneWest was not required to offer any of these benefits to borrowers, and not all servicers adopted these programs. But OneWest's loan retention staff, as well as leadership, were committed to avoiding foreclosures where possible and were tremendous industry partners. To me, OneWest's consistent adoption of new home retention innovations spoke volumes about the company's commitment in this important area.\nHome retention options for the industry were varied and lacked a strong, consistent structure until HOPE NOW members and investors began coordination on a national loan modification structure. These industry efforts were enhanced when the Government HAMP modification program was introduced to servicers and loan investors in 2009. As a reminder, a loan modification means there is a reduction in rate, or change in term, or reduction in principal balance of a loan. Introducing these at scale was challenging to the mortgage industry and the investor community. Yet both the volume and the quality of home retention options OneWest provided to its customers were highly regarded, both by me and my HOPE NOW colleagues and by the federal government offices overseeing servicer performance. Treasury Department reports on loan modifications show that OneWest offered more than 101,000 loan modifications to struggling homeowners. And when OneWest offered loan modifications, its offers included principal forgiveness as much as five times more often industry averages. Its loan modifications also stood out for sustainability: The rate at which its trial modifications were converted to permanent modifications was 91 percent, the highest rate in the industry.\nI should note that OneWest's work to help borrowers through the financial crisis was not limited to modifications but also focused on refinance solutions. OneWest was a major supporter of the Obama Administration's HARP refinancing program, which encouraged banks to refinance high-rate mortgages on properties with little or no equity into more sustainable, lower rate loans. It is my view that this is one of the most important refinance programs that has been offered in the country, preventing subsequent foreclosures and modifications. The GSEs, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and lender partners saved homeowners from default by supporting this innovative refinance program. In 2013, the last year before OneWest sold its mortgage business, the company originated more than $400 million in HARP refinance loans, including more than $70 million to minority borrowers. This last point is particularly relevant, since some media reports have suggested that the company failed to lend in minority communities based on data for the time period after OneWest exited the mortgage business.\nI was very proud to lead HOPE NOW through this very dark economic time. The industry and homeowners struggled with record level defaults and the systems and processes were initially not adequate to accommodate the widespread national problems in the housing market. In order to make progress, the approaches to minimizing foreclosure needed reengineering, partnering, and strong communications, to make sure all options were reviewed to help troubled homeowners avoid foreclosures, and OneWest was an important partner and supporter in this effort.\nDespite all efforts to mitigate foreclosures, OneWest, like all servicers, did foreclose on some borrowers. It is important to review the full picture of activity to understand the scope of the situation and the progress and failures through this time period. One West had far fewer foreclosures than solutions it offered to homeowners. The regrettable fact of the financial crisis is that, for a variety of reasons, some borrowers lacked the financial ability to make payments on their loan obligations on any reasonable terms. For these borrowers, the question is whether OneWest exhausted all home retention options before foreclosing, and it made material errors in the foreclosure process. The best evidence on this question comes from the government's report of the results of the Independent Foreclosure Review, which required the 14 largest mortgage banks to review all their post-crisis foreclosure for compliance errors. This report showed that OneWest made mistakes in the loan modification process less than one-half of one percent of the time. Per the report, it foreclosed on borrowers who were not liable for foreclosure only .001 percent of the time, and in that minuscule number of cases, it paid full restitution to the affected borrowers. Most every institution I worked with through the crisis put their heart and soul into helping homeowners. That often gets lost in the discussions. While even one avoidable foreclosure is too many, my experience working with financial institutions is that OneWest's compliance rate put it at or near the very top performance of servicers.\nLet me reiterate that I do not know Steven Mnuchin personally but I dealt with his management team from the top ranks through the day-to-day staff that worked directly with at-risk borrowers. They were very active with HOPE NOW and supportive of the many efforts underway to help borrowers in default. I have no political agenda in promoting his confirmation. But as the former head of the national organization dedicated to finding home retention solutions for struggling homeowners affected by the financial crisis, I believe the record should be clear about the actual record of OneWest in delivering solutions to many thousands of its customers during my tenure at HOPE NOW.\nVery truly yours,\nFaith Schwartz\nFormer Executive Director\nHOPE NOW", "timestamp": "2017-01-17", "title": "Press Release - Former HOPE NOW Director Issues Letter Supporting Mnuchin Treasury Nomination"}

Donald Trump's choice to run the Education Department has committed the unpardonable sin of devoting much of her fortune to helping poor kids escape failing public schools.\n...\nMrs. DeVos's most important qualification is that she has the courage of her convictions.\n...\nThe DeVoses have donated tens of millions of dollars to charity including a children's hospital in Michigan and an international art competition in Grand Rapids. They've also given to Christian organizations, which the left cites as evidence of concealed bigotry. Yet education has been their main philanthropic cause.\nDuring the 1990s, they patronized a private-school scholarship fund for low-income families and championed Michigan's first charter school law. In 2000 they helped bankroll a voucher initiative, which was defeated by a union blitz. The DeVoses then turned to expanding charters, which have become Exhibit A in the progressive campaign against her.\n...\nTwo studies from Stanford's Center for Research on Education Outcomes (2013, 2015) found that students attending Michigan charters gained on average an additional two months of learning every year over their traditional school counterparts. Charter school students in Detroit gained three months.\n...\nThe real reason unions fear Mrs. DeVos is that she's a rare reformer who has defeated them politically. Prior to being tapped by Mr. Trump, she chaired the American Federation for Children (AFC), which has helped elect hundreds of legislators across the country who support private school choice.\n...\nAFC has built a broad coalition that includes black and Latino Democrats, undercutting the union conceit that vouchers are a GOP plot to destroy public schools. In 2000 four states had private-school choice programs with 29,000 kids. Today, 25 states have vouchers, tax-credit scholarships or education-savings accounts benefitting more than 400,000 students.\n...\nYou know progressives have lost their moral bearings when they save their most ferocious assault for a woman who wants to provide poor children with the education they need to succeed in America.", "timestamp": "2017-01-17", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: WSJ: Who's Afraid of Betsy DeVos?"}

Mrs. DeVos has a real compassion for children and a proven record of championing reforms to improve literacy and learning in our nation. I am confident that she will provide the leadership we sorely need to raise the bar on education in America and provide better opportunities for our most vulnerable students.\n...\nBetsy DeVos has helped pass reforms to drive gains in literacy. The Great Lakes Education Project she founded in Michigan was instrumental in passing a comprehensive reading law last year that provides extra tutoring to struggling students and other intervention strategies to ensure that kids are leaving third grade with the literacy skills they will need to succeed in later grades. Reading is truly the building block of a successful education, and Mrs. DeVos has fought hard to ensure that elected officials in her home state and across the nation are giving literacy its proper attention.\n....\nI also believe Mrs. DeVos has the right priorities on important issues such as school choice, early childhood development and accountability in education. I have worked with Mrs. DeVos' advocacy organizations for years and I know that her commitment to children runs deep. She believes passionately that children should have access to high performing schools regardless of their race, income or zip code. That is why she has fought valiantly to give parents of at-risk children the right to send their kids to charter and private schools when the public school system is letting them down.\n...\nI believe Mrs. DeVos is an educator at heart. She is a woman who has dedicated much of her adult life to fighting some really tough battles on behalf of our nation's school children, including mentoring children for decades in her home state of Michigan. There are powerful forces in our education system that are resistant to change. Mrs. DeVos has the courage to do the thing for parents and their children.\nI know Betsy DeVos is the right woman to help usher in an era of education reforms that can drive significant improvement in student achievement. She has a big heart, a strong backbone and she wants to serve in Washington for only one reason: to make a difference in the lives of America's school children. We need more people like Mrs. DeVos in our nation's capital.

And all of Trump's first week of nominees seem headed toward confirmation.\nSeven Trump picks — Attorney General-designate Jeff Sessions, Homeland Security Secretary-designate John Kelly, Secretary of State-designate Rex Tillerson, Transportation Secretary-designate Elaine Chao, Defense Secretary-designate James Mattis, Housing and Urban Development Secretary-designate Ben Carson, and CIA Director-designate Mike Pompeo — faced Senate committees this week. The number included three of the so-called Big Four cabinet positions — Attorney General, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense. (A hearing for the fourth of the Big Four, Treasury Secretary-designate Stephen Mnuchin, has not yet been scheduled.)\nSome of the hearings went so well that press accounts declared them a \"lovefest.\" Chao's hearing certainly qualified, as did Kelly's. Others, like Mattis's, were smooth and businesslike. Still others, like Sessions', ended up being far less adversarial than expected, either because Democratic attacks lacked energy and focus, or the nominee was able to deftly handle the situation, or both.\n...\nChao's hearing consisted largely of the nominee and Republican and Democratic senators all expressing high regard for each other.\n...\nMattis's hearing included much praise of his competence and qualifications, followed by a broadly bipartisan 24-3 committee vote approving a measure to give Mattis a waiver for a law that would have barred him, as a retired general, from serving now as Defense Secretary. The full Senate went on to approve the waiver 81 to 17.\n...\nAnd in its first week of tests on Capitol Hill, the new administration came out the winner.", "timestamp": "2017-01-13", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: Washington Examiner's Byron York: \"On Capitol Hill, Trump Wins Week One\""}

It's frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the president-elect's campaign to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office.\nAccording to BuzzFeed's own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report. The executive editor of The New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was, quote, \"Totally unsubstantiated, echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet.\"\nThe fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks. The report is not an intelligence report, plain and simple. One issue that the report talked about was the relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign. These three individuals; Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen and Carter Page.\nCarter Page is an individual who the president-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign. Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen, who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time. We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in Prague.\nIn fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague. A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at — at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game. One report now suggested apparently it's another Michael Cohen. For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful.\nWith that, it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States, Mike Pence. [appaluse]\nPence: We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America. [appaluse]\nI am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days from today, but I'm even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again. [appaluse]\nNow, the president-elect's leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive. But as the chairman of the transition effort, I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring. To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet.\nNineteen of the 21 cabinet officials have been announced, nine committee hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a — it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward. Perhaps that's why there's been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration.\nYou know, I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be. But with freedom comes responsibility. And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report, when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news, can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it. [appaluse]\nBut today, we'll get back to real news, to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again. And we'll hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today.\nSo, it is my honor to introduce to all of you, my friend and the president-elect of the United States of America, Donald Trump. [appaluse]\nThe President-Elect: Thank you very much.\nIt's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis. I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it's good to be with you.\nWe stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news, but I do have to say that — and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies? Who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that. A tremendous blot, because a thing like that should have never been written, it should never have been had and it should certainly never been released.\nBut I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years — a couple in particular — and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station.\nSo, I just want to compliment many of the people in the room. I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that. But I will tell you, there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional — so incredibly professional, that I've just gone up a notch as to what I think of you. OK?\nAll right. We've had some great news over the last couple of weeks. I've been quite active, I guess you could say, in an economic way for the country. A lot of car companies are going to be moving in, we have other companies — big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the Midwest.\nYou saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they're going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant.\nI appreciate that from Ford. I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler. I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they will be. I think a lot of people will be following. I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back.\nWe've got to get our drug industry back. Our drug industry has been disastrous. They're leaving left and right. They supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent. And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they're getting away with murder.\nPharma, pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there's very little bidding on drugs. We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly and we're going to start bidding and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.\nAnd we're going to do that with a lot of other industries. I'm very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the F-35, you've been reading about it. And it's way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget. I don't like that. And the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic. I've really gotten to know them well. And we're going to do some big things on the F-35 program, and perhaps the F-18 program. And we're going to get those costs way down and we're going to get the plane to be even better. And we're going to have some competition and it's going to be a beautiful thing.\nSo, we've been very, very much involved, and other things. We had Jack Ma, we had so many incredible people coming here. There are no — they're going to do tremendous things — tremendous things in this country. And they're very excited.\nAnd I will say, if the election didn't turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here. They would not be in my office. They would not be in anybody else's office. They'd be building and doing things in other countries. So, there's a great spirit going on right now. A spirit that many people have told me they've never seen before, ever.\nWe're going to create jobs. I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created. And I mean that, I really — I'm going to work very hard on that. We need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we're going to do a real job. And I'm very proud of what we've done.\nAnd we haven't even gotten there yet. I look very much forward to the inauguration. It's going to be a beautiful event. We have great talent, tremendous talent. And we have the — all of the bands — or most of the bands are from the different — from the different segments of the military. And I've heard some of these bands over the years, they're incredible.\nWe're going to have a very, very elegant day. The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special; very beautiful. And I think we're going to have massive crowds because we have a movement.\nIt's a movement like the world has never seen before. It's a movement that a lot of people didn't expect. And even the polls — although some of them did get it right, but many of them didn't. And that was a beautiful scene on November 8th as those states started to pour in.\nAnd we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated. And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they're gonna have a lot of security. They're going to have a lot of good news for their veterans.\nAnd by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. And we'll do a news release in a little while. Tell you about David, he's fantastic — he's fantastic. He will do a truly great job.\nOne of the commitments I made is that we're gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans. Our veterans have been treated horribly. They're waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in and they have a minor early-stage form of cancer and they can't see a doctor. By the time they get to the doctor, they're terminal. Not gonna happen, it's not gonna happen.\nSo, David is going to do a fantastic job. We're going to be talking to a few people also to help David. And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration, like the Cleveland Clinic, like the Mayo Clinic, a few more than we have. And we're gonna set up a — a group.\nThese are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line. And they're going to get together with their great doctors — Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as you know from the Cleveland Clinic, has been very involved.\nIke Perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business. And we're gonna straighten out the V.A. for our veterans. I've been promising that for a long time and it's something I feel very, very strongly.\nSo, you'll get the information on David. And I think you'll be very impressed with the job he does. We looked long and hard. We interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good. But we had a lot of talent. And we think this election will be something that will, with time — with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good 'cause our veterans have been treated very unfairly.\nOK, questions? Yes, John?\nQuestion: [inaudible] so much.\nThe President-Elect: Thank you.\nQuestion: Appreciate it.\nA couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that we're looking for further clarification on.\nThe President-Elect: Sure.\nQuestion: First of all, did the heads of the intelligence agencies provide you with the two-page summary of these unsubstantiated allegations? And secondly to that, on the broader picture, do you accept their opinion that Vladimir Putin ordered the hack of the DNC and the attempted hack of the RNC?\nAnd if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States?\nThe President-Elect: OK, first of all, these readings as you know are confidential, classified. So, I'm not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting.\nAnd — but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us. And I will say, again, I think it's a disgrace that information would be let out.\nI saw the information; I read the information outside of that meeting. It's all fake news. It's phony stuff. It didn't happen. And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people. It was a group of opponents that got together — sick people — and they put that crap together.\nSo, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it. It should have never been — number one, shouldn't have even entered paper. But it should have never have been released. But I read what was released and I think it's a disgrace. I think it's an absolute disgrace.\nAs far as hacking, I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. And I — I can say that you know when — when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn't make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China.\nWe had — we had much hacking going on. And one of the things we're gonna do, we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we've assembled. You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world — they were never in the same room together as a group. And we're gonna put those minds together and we're going to form a defense.\nAnd I have to say this also, the Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. They did a very poor job. They could've had hacking defense, which we had.\nAnd I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense.\nAnd they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through.\nWe have to do that for our country. It's very important.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: ... just to the last part of that question [inaudible] how could all of this potentially color your attempts to build a better relationship with President Putin?\nThe President-Elect: Well, you know, President Putin and Russia put out a statement today that this fake news was indeed fake news. They said it totally never happened.\nNow, somebody would say, \"Oh, of course he's gonna say that.\"\nI respected the fact that he said that.\nAnd I — I'll be honest, I think if he did have something, they would've released it; they would've been glad to release it.\nI think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would've released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her. I mean what he said about her was horrible.\nIf somebody said about me, what Podesta said about Hillary, I was the boss, I would've fired him immediately or that person. Because what he said about her was horrible.\nBut remember this: We talk about the hacking and hacking's bad and it shouldn't be done. But look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking.\nThat Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn't report it? That's a horrible thing. That's a horrible thing.\nCan you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate — it would've been the biggest story in the history of stories. And they would've said immediately, \"You have to get out of the race.\" Nobody even talked about it. It's a very terrible thing.\nYeah?\nQuestion: Can I ask you a question, sir?\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: Thank you, Mr. President-elect.\nOn that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election.\nDo you accept that part of the finding? And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in place?\nThe President-Elect: Well, if — if Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia. Russia can help us fight ISIS, which, by the way, is, number one, tricky. I mean if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed.\nIf Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That's called an asset, not a liability.\nNow, I don't know that I'm gonna get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there's a good chance I won't. And if I don't, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Give me a break.\nOK?\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: ... President Obama...[crosstalk]... make clear whether during your visits to either Moscow or St. Petersburg, you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable...[crosstalk]\nWould a reasonable observer say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Russia or by its intelligence agencies?\nThe President-Elect: Lemme just tell you what I do.\nWhen I leave our country, I'm a very high-profile person, would you say?\nI am extremely careful. I'm surrounded by bodyguards. I'm surrounded by people.\nAnd I always tell them — anywhere, but I always tell them if I'm leaving this country, \"Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you're gonna probably have cameras.\" I'm not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category.\nAnd number one, \"I hope you're gonna be good anyway. But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places. Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know. You better be careful, or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television.\"\nI tell this to people all the time.\nI was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well — Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well.\nAnd I told many people, \"Be careful, because you don't wanna see yourself on television. Cameras all over the place.\"\nAnd again, not just Russia, all over.\nDoes anyone really believe that story?\nI'm also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me. [laughter] [crosstalk]\nQuestion: ... how you plan to disentangle yourself from your business. But first, I have to follow-up on some of these Russian remarks.\nBased on your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified? Does Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise? And if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it?\nThe President-Elect: So I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia.\nAs a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. I have assets that are — and now people have found out how big the company is, I have very little debt — I have very low debt. But I have no loans with Russia at all.\nAnd I thought that was important to put out. I certified that. So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings. We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict. So I have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals.\nNow, I have to say one other thing. Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Damack, a friend of mine, great guy. And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai — a number of deals and I turned it down.\nI didn't have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I'm president, which is — I didn't know about that until about three months ago, but it's a nice thing to have. But I don't want to take advantage of something. I have something that others don't have, Vice President Pence also has it. I don't think he'll need it, I have a feeling he's not going to need it.\nBut I have a no conflict of interest provision as president. It was many, many years old, this is for presidents. Because they don't want presidents getting — I understand they don't want presidents getting tangled up in minutia; they want a president to run the country. So I could actually run my business, I could actually run my business and run government at the same time.\nI don't like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I would be the only one to be able to do that. You can't do that in any other capacity. But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company — the country. I'd do a very good job, but I don't want to do that.\nNow, all of these papers that you see here — yes, go ahead.\nQuestion: [inaudible] do you believe the hacking was justified? And will you release your tax returns to prove what you're saying about no deals in Russia?\nThe President-Elect: I'm not releasing the tax returns because as you know, they're under audit.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: ... since the '70's has had a required audit from the IRS, the last place to release them, but as president sir...\nThe President-Elect: You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK? They're the only who ask.\nQuestion: You don't think the American public is concerned about it?\nThe President-Elect: No I don't think so. I won, when I became president. No, I don't think they care at all. I don't think they care at all. [appaluse]\nThe President-Elect: I think you care — I think you care. First of all, you learn very little to a tax return. What you should go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers. And actually, people have learned a lot about my company and now they realize, my company is much bigger, much more powerful than they ever thought. We're in many, many countries, and I'm very proud of it.\nAnd what I'm going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company. They are going to be running it in a very professional manner. They're not going to discuss it with me. Again, I don't have to do this. They're not going to discuss it with me. And with that, I'm going to bring up Sheri Dillon, and she's going to go — these papers are just some of the many documents that I've signed turning over complete and total control to my sons.\n[crosstalk]\nSheri Dillion: Good morning. It's my honor and privilege to be here today at President-elect Trump's request.\nHe's asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he's taking. As you know, the business empire built by President-elect Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president. But at that time, no one was so concerned.\nPresident-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people's business and not his own. To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company.\nHe further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests.\nAs he said, he's voluntarily taking this on. The conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and they are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets. The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it, is Section 18 USC 208 and it's simply inapplicable by its terms. And this is not just our interpretation. It's Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that, except as otherwise provided, the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the president.\nEven so, President-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests. He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit. He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law.\nCritical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him. He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H.W. Bush's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center.\nMr. Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan. He's here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump organization.\nI'm gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking. First, President-elect Trump's investments and business assets commonly known as the — as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th. Here is just some of the paperwork that's taking care of those actions.\nSecond, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump.\nFurther, at the president-elect's direction, the trust agreement provides — that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team. The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns.\nPresident-elect Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency. President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities.\nFurther, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization. As she and Jared move their family to D.C., Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools.\nThe president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments. As a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets. Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics.\nSecond, the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with. Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods. Things like Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust.\nThrough instructions in the trust agreement, President-elect trust — President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated. This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016. As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for President-elect Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric.\nThe trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump's presidency. New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process.\nThe president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. Because any new deal could — and I emphasize could — be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues.\nThe ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts. Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval.\nTo further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump Organization, President-elect Trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights. Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole. There will be no separate business by business accounting.\nAnother step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization; the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency.\nHe has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to President-elect Trump's role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency.\nIn sum, all of these actions — complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights — will sever President-elect Trump's presidency from the Trump Organization.\nSome have asked questions. Why not divest? Why not just sell everything? Form of blind trust. And I'd like to turn to addressing some of those questions now.\nSelling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest. In fact, it would exacerbate them. The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization's assets. If President-elect Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency.\nFurther, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny. Was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the president-elect. And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale.\nPresident-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn't even feasible.\nSome people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children. This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated. And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now.\nSome people have suggested that the Trump — that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company. Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter. It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization.\nSome people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses. President Trump can't unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized.DILLON: Further, it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump Organization. The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets. And this approach is best from a conflicts and ethics perspective. It creates a complete separation from President-elect Trump — it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new deal.\nI'm going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments. That's a word I think we've all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before.\nAnd we're gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.\nEmoluments comes from the Constitution. The Constitution says \"officials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office.\"\nThe so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder.\nNo one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. Instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument.\nBut since President-elect Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms. They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm's-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn't even aware of.\nThese people are wrong. This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument.\nThe Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here. But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires.\nSo, President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury. This way, it is the American people who will profit.\nIn sum, I and president-elect's other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we've outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his family.\nWe believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elect's desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure.\nThe American people were well — well aware of President-elect Trump's business empire and financial interests when they voted. Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.\nPresident-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans. Thank you. [appaluse]\n[crosstalk]\nDillon: You're welcome. My pleasure. Yes. Don't want to lose your note. Thank you.\nThe President-Elect: Thank you very much. Here you go, you.\nDillon: Thank you.\nQuestion: Mr. Trump? Thank you. Mr. Trump, [inaudible] from America News.\nWhat is your response to your critics that say not only you, but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest?\nAnd do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your — your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration...\n[crosstalk]\nThe President-Elect: I — I really think that when you watch what's going on with what's happening in — I was just watching, as an example, Rex Tillerson. I think it's brilliant what he's doing and what he's saying.\nI watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator, who is going to be a great attorney general. And he was brilliant. And what people don't know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama. And he was brilliant yesterday.\nSo, I really think that they are — I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together. And we've been hearing that from so many people. People are so happy.\nYou know, in the case of Rex, he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil. When there was a find, he would get it. When they needed something, he would be there.\nA friend of mine who's very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm — big supporter — he said there's nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson.\nAnd that's what we want. That's what I want to bring to government.\nI want to bring the greatest people into government, because we're way behind. We don't make good deals any more. I say it all the time in speeches. We don't make good deals anymore; we make bad deals. Our trade deals are a disaster.Trump: We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis — hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody. We don't make good deals anymore.\nSo we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking, they're smart. And that's what I'd put, I'm very proud of the Cabinet, I think they're doing very well.\nIt's very interesting how it's going, but it's — I think they're doing very, very well.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: ... a quick follow-up on — on Russia, sir.\nThank you, Mr. President-elect. I wanted to ask a few questions on Obamacare?\nThe President-Elect: Yeah.\nQuestion: Can you be specific on what guidance you're giving congressional Republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace, whether it needs to be simultaneous or...\n[crosstalk]\nThe President-Elect: Finally, Obamacare, I thought it was never gonna be asked.\nQuestion: [off-mike] though if you have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like, would it guarantee coverage for those who have gotten health insurance through the current Obamacare law?\nThe President-Elect: You're gonna be very, very proud, as not only the media and reporters, you're gonna be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care. Obamacare is a complete and total disaster.\nThey can say what they want, they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you. In some cases, they guide you incorrectly. In most cases, you realize what's happened, it's imploding as we sit.\nSome states have over a hundred percent increase and '17 and I said this two years ago, '17 is going to be the bad year. It's going to be catastrophic. Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn't be fair to the people.\nWe could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about Obamacare. We don't wanna own it, we don't wanna own it politically. They own it right now.\nSo the easiest thing would be to let it implode in '17 and believe me, we'd get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time. We're going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary's approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan.\nIt'll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially, simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour.\nSo we're gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff. And we're gonna get a health bill passed, we're gonna get health care taken care of in this country. You have deductibles that are so high, that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high.\nObamacare is the Democrats problem. We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them. We're doing them a tremendous service by doing it. We could sit back and let them hang with it. We are doing the Democrats a great service.\nSo as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we'll be filing a plan. And it was actually, pretty accurately reported today, The New York Times. And the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare.\nWe're going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better. OK.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: President-elect, can we just ask you — sir, sir...\nPresident-elect Trump...[crosstalk]\nMr. President — which one?\nThe President-Elect: I was going right here.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: President-elect Trump, Jon Steinberg from Cheddar. When you look at all the meetings that you've had with Carrier, SoftBank and Alibaba, do you conceive of making this a program, maybe sitting inside of commerce?\nAnd then my follow-up question to that, is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cuts?\nThe President-Elect: Well, if I can save jobs, for instance I was doing individual companies and people said well, that's only one company, like we did a good job with Carrier. And I wanna thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs.\nAnd they were gone and Mike Pence and his staff really helped us, a lot. But those were — that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so it's always tough when they're building a plan, just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement.Trump: So I wanna thank United Technologies. But we've been meeting with a lot of companies. But what really is happening, is the word is now out, that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won, for good reason, it's not going to happen that way anymore.\nYou want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you're going to build that plant in Mexico and you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you're making, and you're going to sell it through what will be a very, very strong border — not a weak border like it is — we don't even have a border. It's an open sieve.\nBut you're going to sell through a very strong border — not going to happen. You're going to pay a very large border tax. So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina. You can move from South Carolina back to Michigan.\nYou can do anywhere — you've got a lot of states at play; a lot of competition. So it's not like, oh, gee, I'm taking the competition away. You've got a lot of places you can move. And I don't care, as along as it's within the United States, the borders of the United States.\nThere will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. And you'd have millions more workers right now in the United States that are — 96 million really wanting a job and they can't get. You know that story. The real number — that's the real number.\nSo, that's the way it is. OK. Go ahead.\nQuestion: President-elect, I have a question about the Supreme Court and border security. But I also wanted to ask you about something you said on Twitter this morning. Are we living in Nazi Germany? What were you driving at there? Do you have a problem with the intelligence community?\nAnd on the Supreme Court, what's your timeline? You said a while ago you were down to four. Have you conducted those interviews yet? What's your timeline for nominating?\nAnd on the border fence, it now appears clear U.S. taxpayers will have to pay for it up front. What is your plan to...\nThe President-Elect: That's not clear at all. OK.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: ... to get Mexico to pay for it?\nThe President-Elect: I've got it. Do you have any more? [laughter]\nOn the fence — it's not a fence. It's a wall. You just misreported it. We're going to build a wall. I could wait about a year-and-a-half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office, but I don't want to wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin.\nI don't feel like waiting a year or a year-and-a-half. We're going to start building. Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen, whether it's a tax or whether it's a payment — probably less likely that it's a payment. But it will happen.\nSo, remember this, OK? I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy. I would then say, who is going to pay for the wall? And people would all scream out — 25,000, 30,000 people, because nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had. You know that. You don't like to report that, but that's OK.\nOK, now he agrees. Finally, he agrees.\nBut I say who is going to pay for the wall? And they will scream out, \"Mexico.\"\nNow, reports went out last week — oh, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement. What's the difference? I want to get the wall started. I don't want to wait a year-and-a-half until I make my deal with Mexico. And we probably will have a deal sooner than that.\nAnd by the way, Mexico has been so nice, so nice. I respect the government of Mexico. I respect the people of Mexico. I love the people of Mexico. I have many people from Mexico working for me. They're phenomenal people.\nThe government of Mexico is terrific. I don't blame them for what's happened. I don't blame them for taking advantage of the United States. I wish our politicians were so smart. Mexico has taken advantage of the United States. I don't blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of Mexico. What I say is we shouldn't have allowed that to happen. It's not going to happen anymore.\nSo, in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall, but it will be reimbursed. OK?\nSupreme Court judge. So, as you know, I have a list of 20. I've gone through them. We've met with numerous candidates. They're outstanding in every case. They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society. Jim DeMint was also very much involved, and his group, which is fantastic, and he's a fantastic guy.Trump: So between Leo and Jim DeMint and some senators and some congresspeople, we have a great group of people. I'll be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the United States Supreme Court, a replacement for the great, great Justice Scalia. That will be probably within two weeks of the 20th. So within about two weeks, probably the second week. I consider the first day because we'll also be doing some — some pretty good signings and I think what we'll do is we'll wait until Monday.\nThat will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday, because on Friday, people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration, and then Saturday, as you know, we're having a big church service and lots of good things are happening. So our first day — and you'll all be invited to the signings, but we'll be doing some pretty good signings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday, and then also the next week. And you're all invited.\nBut on the Supreme Court, I'll be making that decision, and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in. I think it's one of the reasons I got elected. I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court, so I think it was a very, very big decision as to why I was elected.\nQuestion: The tweet that you had this morning about are we living in Nazi Germany, what were you driving at there? What are you trying to tell the American public?\nThe President-Elect: I think it was disgraceful — disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. I think it's a disgrace, and I say that — and I say that, and that's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.\nAs far as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they're going to suffer the consequences. They already are. And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up — and by the way, we just found out I was coming down. Michael Cohen — I was being — Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer. He's a good lawyer in my firm. It was just reported that it wasn't this Michael Cohen they we're talking about. So all night long it's Michael Cohen.\nI said, \"I want to see your passport.\" He brings his passport to my office. I say, hey, wait a minute. He didn't leave the country. He wasn't out of the country. They had Michael Cohen of the Trump Organization was in Prague. It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen. It's a disgrace what took place. It's a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen.\nQuestion: Since you're attacking us, can you give us a question? Mr. President-elect —\nThe President-Elect: Go ahead.\nQuestion: Mr. President-elect, since you are attacking our news organization...\nThe President-Elect: Not you.\nQuestion: Can you give us a chance?\nThe President-Elect: Your organization is terrible.\nQuestion: You are attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir? Sir, can you...\nThe President-Elect: Quiet.\nQuestion: Mr. President-elect, can you say...\nThe President-Elect: He's asking a question, don't be rude. Don't be rude.\nQuestion: Can you give us a question since you're attacking us? Can you give us a question?\nThe President-Elect: Don't be rude. No, I'm not going to give you a question. I'm not going to give you a question.\nQuestion: Can you state...\nThe President-Elect: You are fake news. Go ahead.\nQuestion: Sir, can you state categorically that nobody — no, Mr. President-elect, that's not appropriate.\nThe President-Elect: Go ahead. [appaluse]\nQuestion: Do you think President Obama went too far with the sanctions he put on Russia after the hacking?\nThe President-Elect: I don't think he went too far. No.\nQuestion: Will you roll them back? What do you think of Lindsey Graham's plan to send you a bill for...\nThe President-Elect: Plans to send me a bill for what?\nQuestion: Tougher sanctions.\nThe President-Elect: I hadn't heard Lindsey Graham was going to do that. Lindsey Graham. I've been competing with him for a long time. He is going to crack that one percent barrier one day. I didn't realize Lindsey Graham still had it. That's all right. I think Lindsey Graham is a nice guy. I've heard that he is a nice guy and I've been hearing it.\nGo ahead. Go ahead. You've been waiting.\nQuestion: As far as we understand, the intelligence community...\nThe President-Elect: Stand up.\nQuestion: From BBC news. Ian Pannell from BBC news.\nThe President-Elect: BBC news. That's another beauty.\nQuestion: Thank you. Thank you.\nAs far as we understand it, the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations, this false news, as you describe it. If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up, that any of it is true, will you consider your position...\nThe President-Elect: There's nothing they could come back with.\nQuestion: Can you...\nThe President-Elect: Go ahead.\nQuestion: [inaudible] published fake news and all the problems that we've seen throughout the media over the course of the election, what reforms do you recommend for this industry here?\nThe President-Elect: Well, I don't recommend reforms. I recommend people that are — that have some moral compass.\nYou know, I've been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they're talking about people that go and say all sorts of things. But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news more so than anybody. I could name them, but I won't bother, but you have a few sitting right in front of us. They're very, very dishonest people, but I think it's just something we're going to have to live with.Trump: I guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back. When it happens to somebody that doesn't have this — doesn't have that kind of a megaphone, they can't speak back. It's a very sad thing. I've seen people destroyed. I've seen people absolutely destroyed. And I think it's very unfair. So, all I can ask for is honest reporters.\nYes?\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: I just wanted to follow up on the questions about the U.S. intelligence community. And be very clear about what you're saying. Do you trust your U.S. intelligence officials? And what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you're actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community?\nThe President-Elect: Intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important. We are going to be putting in, as you know, Mr. Pompeo and others, you know the Senator Dan Coats. We're going to be putting in some outstanding people. Within 90 days, they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking.\nI want them to cover this situation. I also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly — because we're hacked by everybody — you know, the United States, our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst, it's number 17, in terms of protection.\nIf you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries — they put this in the category of an industry — the United States is last in terms of protecting, let's say, hacking defense. Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National Committee.\nThat's why we weren't hacked. By the way, we were told that they were trying to hack us, but they weren't able to hack. And I think I get some credit because I told Reince, and Reince did a phenomenal job, but I said I want strong hacking defense.\nThe Democratic National Committee didn't do that. Maybe that's why the country runs so badly that way. But I will tell you — wait — wait — wait, let me finish. Within 90 days, we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense, how do we stop this new phenomena — fairly new phenomena because the United States is hacked by everybody.\nThat includes Russia and China and everybody — everybody. OK.\n[crosstalk]\nThe President-Elect: Go ahead — go ahead.\nQuestion: Mr. President-elect, you said, just now, that you believe Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and Jon Podesta's e-mails, et cetera.\nThe President-Elect: All right, but you know what, it could have been others also.\nQuestion: But why did you spend weeks undermining U.S. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement?\nThe President-Elect: Well, I think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press. I think it's pretty sad. First of all, it's illegal. You know, these are — these are classified and certified meetings and reports.\nI'll tell you what does happen. I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody's leaking it out. So, there's — maybe it's my office. Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people. Maybe it's them. And what I did is I said I won't tell anybody. I'm going to have a meeting and I won't tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence.\nAnd what happened is I had my meeting. Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn't know — I didn't tell her. Nobody knew. The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left. And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.\nSo, I don't want that — I don't want that. It's very unfair to the country. It's very unfair to our country; what's happened. That report should have never — first of all, it shouldn't have been printed because it's not worth the paper it's written on. And I thank the New York Times for saying that.\nI thank a lot of different people for saying that. But, I will tell you, that should never, ever happen. OK.\n[crosstalk]\nQuestion: Thank you, Mr. President-elect, can you stand here today, once and for all and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign. And if you do indeed believe that Russia was behind the hacking, what is your message to Vladimir Putin right now?\nThe President-Elect: He shouldn't be doing it. He won't be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I'm leading than when other people have led it. You will see that. Russia will respect our country more. He shouldn't have done it. I don't believe that he will be doing it more now.\nWe have to work something out, but it's not just Russia. Take a look at what's happened. You don't report it the same way; 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by China. And that's because we have no defense. That's because we're run by people that don't know what they're doing.Trump: Russia will have far greater respect for our country when I'm leading it and I believe and I hope — maybe it won't happen, it's possible. But I won't be giving a little reset button like Hillary. Here, press this piece of plastic. A guy looked at her like what is she doing? There's no reset button. We're either going to get along or we're not. I hope we get along, but if we don't, that's possible too.\nBut Russia and other countries — and other countries, including China, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the South China Sea by building their massive fortress, total. Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations.\nI want to thank everybody. So this is all — just so you understand, these papers — because I'm not sure that was explained properly. But these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that I hope at the end of eight years, I'll come back and say, oh, you did a good job. Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I'll say, \"You're fired.\"\nGood-bye, everybody. Good-bye.", "timestamp": "2017-01-11", "title": "The President-Elect's News Conference in New York City"}

Senator Sessions is a man of great character and integrity with a commitment to fairness and equal justice under the law. Based on these qualities, his deep knowledge of the Department of Justice from his time with the U.S. Attorney's office and his decades of service on the Judiciary Committee, I have no doubt he will be guided solely by fidelity to the Constitution and the laws of our great country. I am honored to give him my highest personal and professional recommendation.\"\nFred Gray, African-American Civil Rights Attorney In (Represented Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And Rosa Parks): \"Our state of Alabama is noted for having outstanding individuals who have made significant contributions to this nation. As a case in point, consider Mr. Justice Hugo Black, who was at one time a U.S. Senator from Alabama who was subsequently appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Justice Black became one of the greatest advocates for human and civil rights that has ever sat on the high court. We need such a person to serve as Attorney General of the United States of America. What would be more noteworthy for the State of Alabama than having an Alabamian follow in the footsteps of the late Mr. Justice Hugo Black? Previously I have expressed appreciation for your acts herein stated. I look forward to working with you in any future capacity in which the Lord permits you to serve.\"\nFormer Obama Administration Surgeon General Regina Benjamin: \"I think he'll be fine.

Miller, \"Amid Racism Accusations, Sessions Has Powerful Character Witness,\" The Washington Times, 11/18/16)\nA Career Of Honor And Respect For Americans Of Color\nSenator Sessions voted in favor of the 30-year extension of the Civil Rights Act.\nSenator Sessions was one of the only 17 Republican senators to vote to confirm President's Obama's Attorney General, Eric Holder.\nSenator Sessions spearheaded the effort to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks, an Alabama native and Civil Rights icon.\nWorking with Cory Booker, Senator Sessions led the Senate effort to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the Foot Soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement in Selma, Alabama.\nSenator Sessions publicly supported ongoing efforts to commemorate within the National Park Service the heroic actions of the 1961 Freedom Riders in Anniston and Calhoun County, Alabama.\nA History Of Civil Rights Enforcement\nKu Klux Klan Murderer Henry Hays—In 1981, Sessions worked with DOJ attorneys, the FBI, county investigators, and the county district attorney to solve the murder of nineteen year-old African American Michael Donald. Sessions' U.S. Attorney's office prosecuted \"Tiger\" Knowles as an accomplice, obtaining a guilty plea and life sentence in federal court. After hard investigative work, Sessions shifted the case of KKK murderer Henry Hays to state court where he received the death penalty, which was not then available at the federal level.\nUSA v. Benny Jack Hayes—Sessions' office successfully prosecuted Alabama Ku Klux Klan \"Great Titan\" Bennie Jack Hays, who ordered his son, Henry Hays, to kill an African American, for attempting to defraud his home insurer in order to collect money to pay for his son's legal defense.\nConecuh County—In 1983, Sessions joined in bringing the first lawsuit in the history of the Department of Justice to stop the suppression of African American voting rights. In United States v. Conecuh County, the DOJ Civil Rights Division, along with Sessions, sued white Conecuh County election officials, including the Chair of the local Republican Party. The county settled the lawsuit through a consent decree that ensured election officials would not engage in racial discriminatory conduct designed to harass or intimidate voters, nor discriminate in the selection of election officials at polling places.\nMarengo County—After the District Court found that the at large system for electing members to the county commission and local board of education diluted the voting rights of African Americans in violation of the Voting Rights Act, Sessions assisted the DOJ Civil Rights Division in working with private plaintiffs to craft a districting plan to ensure that African Americans had equal opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice. At the time of the suit, no African American had ever been elected to the commission or the board. DOJ, working with Sessions' office, secured a districting plan that resulted in 3 of the 5 members of both the County Commission and the board of education elected from districts in which the majority of voters were African American. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the plan, and the district court awarded attorney's fees, stating the United States \"was indispensable to the plaintiff's success.\" 667 F. Supp. 786, 799 (S.D. Alabama 1987).\nDallas County—In 1978, the Department of Justice sued Dallas County, Alabama, to replace its at-large election system with a district system. Under the new district system, African Americans had a much better chance of electing the candidates of their choice. Supported by the ACLU, Sessions supported DOJ's Civil Rights Division's extensive litigation and appeals culminating in a 1988 decision from the 11th Circuit Court that created five single member districts for both the County Commission and the Board of Education. Three of these districts contained a majority-African American voter population, increasing the opportunity for African American voters to elect the officeholders of their choice. 636 F.Supp. 704, May 16, 1986; 791 F.2d 831, (11th Cir., May 23, 1986); 661 F.Supp. 955, May 21, 1987; 671 F.Supp. 1337 (11th Cir., Oct. 23, 1987); 850 F.2d 1430 (11th Cir., July 13, 1988); 850 F.2d 1433 (11th Cir., July 13, 1988). Though not required to do so, as U.S. Attorney, Sessions chose to join the filings with the DOJ Civil Rights Division.\nMobile County—After nearly a decade of litigation, a group of students, their parents and the Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, Alabama, entered into a consent decree that integrated many schools in the county but also left untouched many single-race schools. More than a decade after the district court approved the consent decree, DOJ and Sessions—with the support of the NAACP—challenged the decree because it did not fully integrate all the public schools in the county. The District Court modified the consent decree, agreeing with DOJ and Sessions that the school district was not yet fully integrated. See Davis v. Board of Sch. Comm'rs of Mobile Cnty., 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27519, at *2–3 (S.D. Ala., Mar. 27, 1986). In addition to joining the legal arguments made by the DOJ Civil Rights Division in the case and serving as DOJ's local face in the Southern District of Alabama, where the suit was prosecuted, Sessions also sent his children to attend the integrated public schools in Mobile.", "timestamp": "2017-01-11", "title": "Press Release - U.S. Sen.

This is exactly the type of experience and leadership our country needs to grow the economy for all Americans.\nMnuchin understands the importance of free markets and access to capital. From Main Street businesses to the Fortune 500 companies, he understands the impact of excess regulation and knows how to grow wages.\nAs a regional banker, Mnuchin loaned money to individuals, families, farmers and small businesses. At Goldman Sachs he managed 5,000 employees and a $1 billion annual technology budget.\nHe knows how to help hardworking Americans achieve success, how to make our country competitive and how to engage technology and people. Importantly, he understands how currency impacts trade, and he will represent America on the global stage.\nAs Treasury secretary, Mnuchin will restore robust economic growth through lower taxes, higher wages and less burdensome government regulation. At the top of his policy agenda is reforming our complex, cumbersome and counterproductive tax code for everyone.\nHe proposes reducing business taxes to bring the tax burden on U.S. businesses more in line with that of our global competitors, and creating a tax system that favors companies that produce goods and services in the U.S., thereby creating jobs here.\nThis system will benefit the American student, the American family, the American worker, the American employer and the American entrepreneur by valuing their efforts and equalizing the tax burden to make us more competitive and, quite frankly, more successful.\nMnuchin also wants to put more money in people's pockets by simplifying and reducing taxes on individuals, particularly the middle class. In addition, he will bring back more than $2.6 trillion in revenue that American companies have earned in foreign markets, now stranded by tax policies enacted in the 1960s.\nMnuchin understands why the U.S. economy hasn't performed up to its full potential. He has a clear plan to fix it, which is why he needs to be confirmed quickly so he can hit the ground running as close to Jan. 20 as possible.\nMnuchin and President-elect Trump will disrupt the status quo and promote higher growth and better wages. That's exactly what we need right now.\nSafra Catz is chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation.", "timestamp": "2017-01-11", "title": "Press Release - Oracle CEO Safra Catz: Steven Mnuchin Will Get America Growing Again"}

Sessions' 'Character And Qualifications' In Opening Statement\nClick To Watch\nGRASSLEY: \"Our hearing today hardly introduces Senator Sessions to the Committee. No, we're here today to review the character and qualifications of a colleague who has served alongside us in the Senate for twenty years. That includes time as the Ranking Member of this Committee. We know him well. We know the policy positions he has taken as a legislator. I've been on both sides of debates with Senator Sessions. Having served with him for so long we pretty well know whether he supports your policy positions or opposes them. He tells us so with thoughtfulness, humility, and respect. As a former Chairman of this Committee has put it, Senator Sessions is 'wonderful to work with.' We know him to be, as another senior Democrat on this Committee described him, 'a man of his word.' As a third senior Democrat colleague put it, \"he is always a gentleman'; 'he is straightforward and fair.'\n\"Most of all, the Members of this Committee know him to be a leader who has served the people of Alabama-and all Americans- with integrity, dedication, and courage.\n\"As former Chairman Leahy observed the last time a new President took office, it's 'important that the Justice Department have its senior leadership in place without delay. . . . We need the Justice Department to be at its best.' Perhaps my good friend Senator Schumer said it best when he observed that we should 'move to a vote, hopefully sooner rather than later.' And when we do, as he said, we 'won't be voting for or against the President's policies.' Instead, we'll be voting for a colleague with a first-rate legal mind whose record proves his commitment to just law enforcement and eminently qualifies him to lead the Department of Justice.\n\"I've been encouraged by the initial support many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have expressed for Senator Sessions' nomination. So I look forward to hearing from Senator Sessions and moving to his confirmation without delay.\n\"Senator Sessions' record is a life of public service. And so we know his story. He was raised in the small town of Hybart, Alabama, where his father owned and ran a small country store. He then studied at Huntingdon College and the University of Alabama before practicing law in Russellville and Mobile. Senator Sessions has always been an active member of his community. He taught school before attending law school and taught Sunday School at Ashland Place Methodist Church. He served our Nation in the Army Reserve, attaining the rank of Captain.\n\"After his time in private practice, Senator Sessions served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of Alabama. He then headed that office after the Senate confirmed him as United States Attorney, a post he held for a dozen years. All told, that's 15 years as a federal prosecutor in the Department.\n\"It was during that time that he oversaw the investigation of Klansman Francis Hays for the brutal abduction and murder of a black teenager, Michael Donald. He made sure that case was brought in state court where the defendant was eligible for and received the punishment he justly deserved, the death penalty. His office then successfully prosecuted that murderer's accomplice in federal court.\n\"Based on his prosecutorial record, the people of Alabama elected him their Attorney General and then their Senator. He has served with us since 1997. And, as our former Chairman observed, this Committee has relied on him for his prosecutorial experience during the course of his Senate service.\n\"Throughout his public service, both within the Department and outside of it, he has raised his hand and served when called upon. He has done his duty, enforced the law fairly, and let the chips fall where they may.\n\"Reflecting on this record of service, it's no surprise that Senator Sessions is also an Eagle Scout. Other members of this Committee may know, as I do, that the Scouts' motto-\"Be Prepared\"-sits on his desk in his Senate office.\n\"Senator Sessions' entire life of dedicated public service has prepared him for this day. If he's confirmed-and I expect he will be-Senator Sessions will shed his role as a legislator who writes our laws and he'll take on the task of enforcing the laws Congress has written. He has made this transition before, when the people of the State of Alabama elected him their Senator based on his record of service as United States Attorney and Attorney General there.\n\"As one Member of this Committee observed about a lawyer's transition into the role of a judge: 'There are turning points in a person's life when they put away things of the past and move into new responsibilities.' Serving as our Nation's Attorney General will mark another such turning point in Senator Sessions' distinguished career.\n\"And every Member of this Committee knows from experience that, in his new role, Senator Sessions will be a leader for law and order administered without regard to person.\n\"Leadership to that end is exactly what the Department now needs. It should go without saying that the Department is tasked with the responsibility of enforcing our laws-ALL of our laws- in a dispassionate and even-handed way.\n\"We write the laws. The Executive enforces them, faithfully. This is a simple but foundational principle.\n\"Unfortunately, for the last several years the Department has simply declined to enforce some laws the Executive branch found distasteful. The Department's failure to enforce the law has run the gamut of issues from criminal law legislation to our nation's duly enacted immigration laws.\n\"It's true that each branch of government has an independent duty to assess the constitutionality of the laws it writes, administers, or adjudicates. But it's equally true that the Executive has a constitutional responsibility to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" I know our colleague Senator Sessions respects the legislative process and the prerogative of Congress to write the law. As he explained during the confirmation hearing we held for John Ashcroft's nomination to serve as Attorney General, \"The Attorney General is a law enforcer. There is a big difference between a politician and a Senator where we vote on policy and executing policy.\n\"I look forward to hearing from Senator Sessions on how he will transition from voting on policy matters to enforcing the laws he has labored so long to improve and sustain.\n\"Just as he respects Congress's duly enacted laws, Senator Sessions knows and respects the importance of an independent Attorney General at the Department's helm. When he has questioned other candidates for the office of Attorney General, he has made plain the priority of an Attorney General's independence.\nSen. Richard Shelby Lauds Sessions' \"Extraordinary Character,' 'Intellect,' 'Integrity'\nClick To Watch\nSHELBY: \"Although my friend and colleague, Jeff Sessions, is well known to the members of this committee, it's my distinct privilege to introduce him as president-elect Donald Trump's nominee to serve as our next United States attorney general.\n\"Before joining the Senate, Jeff sessions began his distinguished career as a practicing attorney, and then served as the United States attorney for Alabama's Southern district, before ultimately becoming the attorney general of the state of Alabama.\n\"During the past 20 years here in the U.S. Senate that I have served with Jeff Sessions, I've had the opportunity to know him well, not just as a skilled attorney with an accomplished record as a prosecutor and as a legislator, but a man of extraordinary character. I have the highest regard, not only for his intellect, but for his integrity.\n\"Unfortunately, since the announcement of his nomination, Jeff's political opponents have attacked his character with baseless and tired allegations, but in reality, Jeff Sessions' extensive record of treating all-Americans equally under the law is clear and well documented.\n\"Throughout his decades of public service, including his impressive tenure on this committee, Jeff's commitment to upholding the rule of law I believe is unparalleled. The integrity, humility and gravity with which Jeff Sessions will approach the Office of Attorney General of the United States is unquestionable. I have no doubt, Mr. Chairman, that he will apply the law with the impartiality required of the job. I'm also confident this committee will report favorably and expeditiously, Jeff Sessions' nomination to be the next attorney general of the United States.\"\nSen. Susan Collins Gives Powerful Intro To Sen. Sessions' Character, Calls Out Vicious Personal Attacks\nClick To Watch\nCOLLINS: \"I am pleased to join Senator Shelby in presenting my friend and colleague senator Jeff Sessions and to offer my support for his nomination to be our next attorney general.\n\"Jeff Sessions and I were first sworn in to the United States Senate on the very same day. In the 20 years since, we have worked closely on some issues and on opposite sides on others. In fact, it would be fair to say that we have had our share of vigorous debates and policy disagreements.\n\"Through these experiences, I have come to know Senator Sessions professionally as a trusted colleague and personally as a good friend. I can vouch confidently for the fact those Jeff sessions is a person of integrity, a principled leader, and a dedicated public servant.\n\"As a senator, Jeff Sessions has worked across the aisle to lead important legislative reforms. He's worked with Senator Dick Durbin to pass the Fair Sentencing Act, a law that addressed the unfair racial disparity in crack cocaine sentencing. He worked with Senator Ted Kennedy to pass the Prison Rape Elimination Act. And with Senator Chris Coons on the reauthorization of the Victims of Child Abuse Act, an area where Senator Sessions and I have worked together is in opposing unfair trade agreements and practices that hurt American workers.\n\"What I want this committee and the American people to know, is that Jeff Sessions is the same genuine, fair-minded person in the unguarded private moments as he is in the halls of the Senate. We first came to know each other during dinners with other members of our Senate class, where we discussed everything from our politics to our families.\n\"I have never witnessed anything to suggest that Senator Sessions is anyone other than a dedicated public servant and a decent man. In 1980, long before he ran for the Senate or even dreamed of being attorney general, Jeff Sessions sponsored the first African-American member of the Mobile Lions Club. As U.S. attorney, he provided leadership and the successful convictions of two Klan members who had murdered an African-American teenager.\n\"As Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2009, he appointed the first African-American to serve as chief counsel to the Republican members. My friends, these are not the actions of an individual who is motivated by racial animus. In spite of his strong record, Senator Sessions nomination has generated controversy. He has had to withstand some very painful attacks on his characters, both years ago and again today, with little or no acknowledgment of his accomplishments and actions, or the responses he has made to the accusations levied against him.\n\"As this committee debates this nomination, I would draw your attention to an important epilogue to Jeff Sessions nomination 31 years ago to be a federal judge. The late Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania was a member of the judiciary committee when the Sessions nomination was considered in 1986. Senator Specter, then a Republican, voted against Jeff Sessions.\n\"Years later, in 2009, Senator Specter had switched parties. He was asked by a reporter if he regretted any of the more than 10,000 votes he had cast. Out of all of those votes, then Democratic Senator Specter sited just one. It was his vote against confirming Jeff Sessions as a federal judge.\n\"When asked why, Senator Specter replied, quote, 'because I have since found that Senator Sessions is Egalitarian.', end quote. In other words, once Senator Specter served with Jeff Sessions and had the opportunity to get to know him, he changed his mind.\n\"I hope that you will keep Arlen Specter's reflections in mind, as this committee evaluates Senator Sessions' public service, his character and his fidelity to the rule of law.\"\nSen. Sessions Forcefully Defends His Record \"Straight On\"\nClick To Watch\nSESSIONS: \"Let me address another issue straight on. I was accused in 1986 of failing to protect the voting rights of African-Americans by presenting the Perry County case, the voter fraud case, and of condemning civil rights advocates and organizations and even harboring, amazingly, sympathies for the KKK.\n\"These (inaudible) false charges. The voter fraud case my office prosecuted was in response to pleas from African-American incumbent elected officials who claimed that the absentee ballot process involved a situation in which ballots cast for them were stolen, altered and cast for their opponents. The prosecution sought to protect the integrity of the ballot, not to block voting. It was a voting rights case.\n\"As to the KKK, I invited civil rights attorneys from Washington, D.C. to help us solve a very difficult investigation into the unconscionable, horrendous death of a young African-American coming home from the 7-Eleven store at night simply because he was black. His -- Michael O'Donnell -- and actively backed the attorneys throughout the case and they broke that case.\n\"That effort led to a guilty plea and a life sentence in court for one defendant and his testimony against this other defendant. There was no federal death penalty at the time. I felt the death penalty was appropriate in this case and I pushed to have it tried in state court, which was done. That defendant was indeed convicted and sentenced to death.\n\"And 10 years later, ironically, as Alabama's attorney general, my staff participated in the defense of that verdict and sentence, and a few months after, I became a United States senator and that murdering klansman was indeed executed.\n\"I abhor the Klan and what it represents and its hateful ideology. I insisted Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center and his lawsuit that led to the successful collapse of the Klan at least in Alabama, the seizure of their building, at least for that period of time.\n\"As civil rights division attorneys have testified before the committee, I supported fully their historic cases that the Justice Department filed to advance civil rights and that I supported, including cases to desegregate schools, abolish at-large elections for cities, county commissions and school boards.\n\"These at-large elections were a mechanism used to block African- American candidates from being able to be elected to boards and commissions. It was deliberate and part of a systemic plan to reduce the ability of African-Americans to have influence in the election and governing process.\n\"I never declared the NAACP was un-American or that a civil rights attorney was a disgrace to his race. There is nothing I am more proud of than my 14 years of service in the Department of Justice. I love and venerate that great institution. I hold dear its highest ideals. As God gives me the ability, I will work every day to be worthy of the demands of this august office.\n\"You can be absolutely sure that I understand the immense responsibility I would have. I am not naive. I know the threat that our rising crime and addiction rates pose to the health and safety of our country. I know the threat of terrorism. I deeply understand the history of civil rights in our country and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters. I have witnessed it.\n\"We must continue to move forward and never back. I understand the demands for justice and fairness made by our LGBT community. I will ensure that the statutes protecting their civil rights and their safety are fully enforced.\n\"I understand the lifelong scars worn by women who are victims of assault and abuse. And if I am so fortunate to be confirmed as your attorney general, you can know that I understand the absolute necessity, that all my actions must fall within the bounds of the Constitution and the laws of the United States. While all humans must recognize the limits of their abilities, and I certainly do, I am ready for this job. We will do it right. Your input will be valued. Local law enforcement will be our partners. Many friends in federal government that I've had in law enforcement will be respected.\n\"I've always loved the law. It is the very foundation of this country. It is the exceptional foundation of America. I have an abiding commitment to pursuing and achieving justice and a record of doing that. And if confirmed, I will give all my efforts to this goal. I only ask that you do your duty as God gives you the ability to see that duty as your charge by the Constitution.\"\nSen. Sessions: As Police Work With Their Communities, \"We As A Nation Need To Respect Our Law Officers\"\nClick To Watch\nSESSIONS: \"That is the kind of thing that too often happens. We need to be sure that when we criticize law officers, it is narrowly focused on the right basis for criticism and to smear whole departments, places those officers at greater risk.\n\"And we are seeing an increase in murder of police officers, it was up 10 percent last year. So I could just say, I could feel -- I could feel in my bones, how it was going to play out in the real world when we had, what I thought often times, was legitimate criticism of a perhaps, wrong doing by an officer. But spilling over to a condemnation of our entire police force and morale has been affected.\n\"And its impacted the crime rates in Baltimore and crime rates in Chicago. I don't think there's any doubt about it. I regret that's happening, I think it can be restored. But we need to understand the requirement that the police work with the community and be respectful of their community, but we as a nation, need to respect our law officers too.\"\nSessions Pledged Loyalty To The Constitution, Rule Of Law And Equal Justice\nClick To Watch\nSESSIONS: \"I want to thank President-elect Donald Trump for the confidence and trust he has shown in me by nominating me to serve as the Attorney General of the United States. I feel the weight of an honor greater than I aspired to. If I am confirmed, I will commit to you and to the American people to be worthy of the office and the special trust that comes with it.\n\"So, I come before you today as a colleague, who's worked with you for years -- and some of you 20 years. You know who I am, you know what I believe in, you know that I'm a man of my word and can be trusted to do what I say I will do. You know that I revere the Constitution, that I'm committed to the rule of law. And you know that I believe in fairness, impartiality and equal justice under law.\n\"Over the years, you've heard me say many times that I love the Department of Justice. The Office of Attorney General of the United States is not a normal political office and anyone who holds it must have totally fidelity to the laws and the Constitution of the United States.\n\"He or she must be committed to following the law. He or she must be willing to tell the president or other top officials if -- no if he or they overreach. He or she cannot be a mere rubber stamp. He or she must set the example for the employees of the department to do the right thing and ensure that when they do the right thing they know the attorney general will back them up.\n\"No matter what politician might call or what powerful special interest, influential contributor or friend might try to intervene. The message must be clear, everyone is expected to do their duty. That is the way I was expected to perform as an assistant United States attorney working for Attorney General Meese in part of my career.\n\"And that is the way I trained my assistants when I became United States attorney. And if confirmed, that is the way I will lead the Department of Justice. In my over 14 years in the Department of Justice, I tried cases personally of every kind; drug trafficking, very large international smuggling cases, many firearms cases, other violent crimes, a series of public corruption cases of quite significance, financial wrongdoing and environmental violations.\n\"Our office supported historic civil rights cases and major civil cases; protecting the people of this country from crime and especially from violent crime is a high calling of the men and women of the Department of Justice.\"", "timestamp": "2017-01-10", "title": "Press Release - Top Moments from Today's Hearing on Sen.

His help on the strangling regulations that our country is faced with will be invaluable.\"\n\"I am proud to serve President-elect Trump as a special advisor on regulatory reform,\" said Mr. Icahn. \"Under President Obama, America's business owners have been crippled by over $1 trillion in new regulations and over 750 billion hours dealing with paperwork. It's time to break free of excessive regulation and let our entrepreneurs do what they do best: create jobs and support communities. President-elect Trump is serious about helping American families, and regulatory reform will be a critical component of making America work again.\"\nMr. Icahn is a New York City native and grew up in Far Rockaway, Queens. After receiving a degree in philosophy from Princeton University in 1957, he attended medical school at New York University and then joined the Army. Carl began his career on Wall Street in 1961. In 1968, he formed Icahn & Co., and has gone on to become one of the most well-known and influential investors in America, holding substantial or controlling positions in numerous American companies over the years, including RJR Nabisco, Texaco, Philips Petroleum, Western Union, Gulf & Western, Viacom, Revlon, Time Warner, Motorola, Chesapeake Energy, Dell, Netflix, Apple, and eBay. His efforts have improved the competitiveness of American companies in a wide range of industries, including real estate, telecommunications, transportation, industrial services, oil refining and manufacturing.\nCarl has been deeply involved in many charitable endeavors for years. In 2012, in recognition of Carl's gift of $200 million, the Mount Sinai School of Medicine was renamed the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the Institute of Genomics was renamed the Icahn Genomics Institute. The School of Medicine also established the Icahn Scholars Program to attract world-class physician-scientists. He also funded the Icahn Medical Institute Building at Mount Sinai Hospital and the Institute of Genomics, a genomics and multi-scale biology research program. Carl serves as a trustee on the boards of the School of Medicine and Mount Sinai Hospital.\nIn the realm of education, Carl established seven Icahn Charter Schools in The Bronx borough of New York City. The mission of the schools is based on the belief that all students deserve a rigorous academic program through which they will increase their capacity to learn. At Choate Rosemary Hall, a premiere boarding school located in Wallingford, Connecticut, where he previously served on the board of trustees, he endowed the Icahn Scholars Program, which has awarded a large number of scholarships to underprivileged students.\nCarl has also made significant donations to the Randall's Island Sports Foundation, where he previously served as a trustee, for the construction of Icahn Stadium, a track and field stadium located on Randall's Island. In addition, he has served as a trustee on the board of Lincoln Center.\nCarl Icahn will be advising the President in his individual capacity and will not be serving as a federal employee or a Special Government Employee and will not have any specific duties.", "timestamp": "2016-12-21", "title": "Press Release - President-Elect Donald J.

Trump today announced the formation of the White House National Trade Council (NTC) and his selection of Dr. Peter Navarro to serve as Assistant to the President and Director of Trade and Industrial Policy.\nThe formation of the National Trade Council further demonstrates the President-elect's determination to make American manufacturing great again and to provide every American the opportunity to work in a decent job at a decent wage. Navarro is a visionary economist and will develop trade policies that shrink our trade deficit, expand our growth, and help stop the exodus of jobs from our shores.\nThe mission of the National Trade Council will be to advise the President on innovative strategies in trade negotiations, coordinate with other agencies to assess U.S. manufacturing capabilities and the defense industrial base, and help match unemployed American workers with new opportunities in the skilled manufacturing sector. The National Trade Council will also lead the Buy America, Hire America program to ensure the President-elect's promise is fulfilled in government procurement and projects ranging from infrastructure to national defense.\nThe National Trade Council will work collaboratively and synergistically with the National Security Council, the National Economic Council, and the Domestic Policy Council to fulfill the President's vision of peace and prosperity through military and economic strength. For the first time, there will be a council within the White House that puts American manufacturing and American workers first, and that thinks strategically about the health of America's defense industrial base and the role of trade and manufacturing in national security.\nAs a Harvard Ph.D. economist and UC-Irvine professor, Navarro has been instrumental in challenging the prevailing Washington orthodoxy on so-called free trade.\n\"I read one of Peter's books on America's trade problems years ago and was impressed by the clarity of his arguments and thoroughness of his research,\" said President-elect Trump. \"He has presciently documented the harms inflicted by globalism on American workers, and laid out a path forward to restore our middle class. He will fulfill an essential role in my administration as a trade advisor.\"\nDuring the campaign, Navarro, together with Commerce Secretary-designee Wilbur Ross, worked to develop and communicate the trade and economic agenda of the President-elect and a new vision to bring back America's manufacturing wealth.\n\"Peter Navarro is the best person President-elect Donald Trump could have chosen to head his National Trade Council,\" said Ross. \"We were a great team during the campaign, and we will be a great team during the Administration.\"\n\"I am deeply honored for the opportunity to serve the President-elect and this nation and to advise on policies to rebalance our trade, rebuild our industrial base, and restore America's comprehensive national power by making America great again,\" said Navarro.", "timestamp": "2016-12-21", "title": "Press Release - President-Elect Donald J.

Trump today announced he intends to nominate former U.S. Army infantry officer and current Virtu Financial Founder and Executive Chairman Vincent \"Vinnie\" Viola as Secretary of the Army.\nAs Secretary of the Army, Viola will combine a deep background in national security affairs with an impressive track record of leading and managing high-performing teams within the military and the private sector. Viola is a West Point graduate and U.S. Army veteran. He was trained as an Airborne Ranger infantry officer and served in the 101st Airborne Division. Viola has long been engaged with national security issues even after his military service.\nFollowing the terrorist attacks on September 11, Viola worked tirelessly to support the Army philanthropically in the areas of counterterrorism, cybersecurity and leadership development, including helping to found the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. He has also founded multiple high-value companies, including Virtu Financial, and chaired the New York Mercantile Exchange. Viola's business experience makes him well positioned to help guide a Fortune 10-sized company, the U.S. Army, to accomplish its broad mission in the most innovative and efficient way possible.\n\"I am proud to have such an incredibly accomplished and selfless individual as Vincent Viola as our Secretary of the Army,\" said President-elect Donald J. Trump. \"Whether it is his distinguished military service or highly impressive track record in the world of business, Vinnie has proved throughout his life that he knows how to be a leader and deliver major results in the face of any challenge. He is a man of outstanding work ethic, integrity, and strategic vision, with an exceptional ability to motivate others. The American people, whether civilian or military, should have great confidence that Vinnie Viola has what it takes to keep America safe and oversee issues of concern to our troops in the Army.\"\n\"It is an honor to be nominated to serve our country as President-elect Trump's Secretary of the Army,\" said Viola. \"If confirmed, I will work tirelessly to provide our President with the land force he will need to accomplish any mission in support of his National Defense Strategy. A primary focus of my leadership will be ensuring that America's soldiers have the ways and means to fight and win across the full spectrum of conflict. This great honor comes with great responsibility, and I will fight for the American people and their right to live free every day.\"\nViola is living proof of the American dream. He was born and raised in an Italian immigrant family in Brooklyn, and his father worked a truck driver. Viola was inspired to join the military after witnessing his father's service in the U.S. Army in World War II. Viola was the first member of his family to attend college, and after graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1977, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army that same year. After graduating from the Infantry Officer Basic Course and Ranger School, Viola reported to duty with the 101st Airborne Division. Viola remained a member of the U.S. Army Reserve after the completion of his active duty service. In 1983, he received his J.D. from New York Law School.\nIn the 1980s, Viola worked as a trader on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and also founded the first of many business ventures, including Pioneer Futures and the Independent Bank Group. After a long and influential career, Viola was appointed Chairman of NYMEX in March 2001.\nViola's leadership of NYMEX on and after 9/11 resulted in the board of Exchange recognizing his actions with a citation that included this statement:  \"His heroic leadership served as a beacon to thousands of Exchange members and staff, providing us with the fortitude to resume operations and preserve the efficiency of the American economy and global energy and metals markets in the face of this great tragedy.\" In 2008, Viola founded Virtu Financial, a global leader in electronic market making, and took the company public in 2015.\nViola has also been deeply involved in a number of philanthropic causes. Viola has endowed the Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J. Chair in Catholic Theology at Fordham University and is a major supporter of the Catholic Leadership Institute and its mission to provide world-class leadership formation to bishops, priests and deacons. He is also the owner of the NHL's Florida Panthers.\nViola lives in New York City with his wife Teresa.

His experience in the military and his success in business make him the kind of leader the Army needs to be effective in protecting and defending our nation. He has a prolific track record as an innovator who gets things done. In nominating Vinnie as his choice for Secretary of the Army, President-elect Trump has chosen the right leader for our nation's soldiers.\"\nKaren Greenberg, Director of the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School and author of Rogue Justice: The Making of the Security State:\n\"The nomination of Vincent Viola is a reassuring one. Mr. Viola is a free thinker as well as a patriot. He has a deep understanding of global resources, a fair-minded approach to understanding complex issues, and an appreciation for the work of all of the branches of the armed services.

A West Point graduate, he is well-informed across a spectrum of ideas and approaches to American foreign and military policy, preparing him well to make informed and thoughtful decisions.\"\nDick Grasso, former Chairman and CEO, New York Stock Exchange (1995-2003):\n''I have been privileged to call Vinnie Viola a dear friend since we began working together almost twenty years ago when he served as Chairman, New York Mercantile Exchange, and I was Chairman of The New York Stock Exchange. While the consummate professional and natural leader, Vinnie's greatest leadership of the NYMEX came in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11. He was faced with the almost impossible task of restoring trading in a building which was only steps from the fallen twin towers. It was clear that his education at West Point, and his leadership skills from active duty service would accept nothing less than complete restoration of trading no matter the challenges presented. He worked 24/7 with city and state officials and his private sector partners to ensure a prompt resumption of trading which I was honored to attend. As a graduate of West Point, he presided, posted the colors, presented our national anthem, and credited everyone but himself for this incredible feat. Vinnie's love of our nation and those who serve is simply remarkable. If confirmed, he will make an outstanding Secretary of the Army.\"\nBruce Hoffman, a senior fellow at the Combating Terrorism Center:\n\"...Trump's nomination of Viola is an 'inspired pick.' He was a driving force in both forming and funding the center, and was motivated by his experiences helping colleagues at the New York Mercantile Exchange evacuate from lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks, Hoffman said.\n\"'He was always in the background there, but it was never about him,' Hoffman said of Viola's influence on the West Point center. 'He imparted his wisdom on a one-to-one basis, but he was not someone who was up that mic and or the dais. It was never about him.'\" (Washington Post)", "timestamp": "2016-12-19", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying...Leaders Praise the Selection of Vincent Viola to Serve as Secretary of the Army"}

He went above and beyond the call of duty as a Navy SEAL for more than two decades. After hanging up the uniform, he decided to continue his service by representing the people of Montana in the House. As a member of the Natural Resources Committee, he has been an ardent supporter of all-of-the-above energy policies and responsible land management. And as a Westerner with close to one third of his state owned by the federal government, he is intimately familiar with how Washington's decisions affect people's lives. Ryan's experience and commitment to improving the lives of all Americans will make him an excellent Interior Secretary. I could not be happier for Ryan, Lola, and their entire family.\"\nU.S. Senator Steve Daines (R-MT):\n\"Ryan Zinke protected us abroad and in combat and I know he will do the same for our treasured public lands as Secretary of the Interior,\" Daines stated. \"In Congress, I've seen Ryan stand up and fight to protect our way of life. As a westerner, Ryan understands the challenges of having the federal government as your largest neighbor and I couldn't think of a better fit for Secretary of the Interior.\"\nHouse Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop (R-UT):\n\"Selfishly, I'm not crazy about this nomination, because Zinke was a bright freshman member of our committee. This will be a loss for us. I was looking forward to working with him on Resources and in the Western Caucus. However, this appointment gives us greater opportunity to help people and solve problems that face the West.\n\"In our committee, he dealt with many issues including transmission rights-of-way to move power from its production source to where the people are. He experienced firsthand the frustrations associated with an administration that didn't put its priorities on helping people and effective land management.\n\"He also understands our frustrations with Interior's arbitrary rules and regulations that put dogma ahead of helping people. He clearly understands Speaker Ryan's Article I initiative. I am excited to have an administration that will now partner with Congress to solve problems created by years of mismanagement at Interior. I look forward to working with Zinke to create new solutions.\"\nRep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC):\n\"The selection of Congressman Ryan Zinke to head up the Department of the Interior is another great addition by the President-Elect to an already excellent cabinet. I am very excited about the pick and I hope that he accepts. This Navy SEAL has been a pleasure to work with over the last Congress. I had the chance to serve with Ryan on the Committee on Natural Resources, which oversees the Department. He showed a depth of knowledge concerning interior issues that will provide an experienced voice in President Trump's White House. Whether that be ensuring that the American public has access to federal lands or that we are developing the energy resources in federal areas, Ryan is someone who is on the right side of these important issues. Ryan and I also share the similar passions for the outdoors and sportsmen's issues. As Co-Chairman of the largest Caucus in Congress - the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus (CSC) - I look forward to working with a fellow outdoorsman on issues important to the hunters, fishermen, shooters and outdoor loving Americans. Initiatives of the CSC like the SHARE Act will be a top priority in the next Congress. I believe Ryan will be ready to help deliver real results to these efforts as well as many others while Secretary of the Interior.\"\nDale Hall, CEO of Ducks Unlimited:\n\"We are pleased to see a hunter and conservationist nominated to the top public lands position and look forward to working with Rep. Zinke on issues of critical importance to conservation.\"\nRob Sisson, President of ConservAmerica:\n\"ConservAmerica congratulates Rep. Ryan Zinke on his nomination to be the next Secretary of the Interior. Based on conversations I've had with Rep. Zinke on a number of issues, I am confident President Elect Trump made an inspired choice. Mr. Trump's comments last week in North Carolina about public lands and the party's Theodore Roosevelt conservation legacy foreshadowed this caliber of nominee.\"\nPaul Walker, Executive Director of ConservAmerica:\n\"His Montana background will serve him well in this role. About one-third of Montana's land mass is public, providing Rep. Zinke a firm grounding in the challenges inherent in the stewardship of public lands and local economies. His current constituency includes ranchers, farmers, loggers, hunters, anglers, Native Americans, miners, and high-tech innovators. In order to pass our great public lands legacy on to future generations, we need those groups to work more closely as stakeholders with appropriate government agencies. Rep. Zinke is a leader who can bring them together.\"\nTina Beattie, Chair of the ConservAmerica Board:\n\"We stand ready to partner with the new Secretary of Interior as our nation seeks to continue its record of good stewardship of our land, water, and wildlife. We're excited to see him bring his Navy SEAL ethic to the Department of the Interior.\"\nLand Tawney, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers (BHA) President and CEO:\n\"Congressman Zinke understands the importance of public lands and balancing management of these important resources with energy development and other uses. As Montana's lone representative in the House of Representatives, Mr. Zinke has showed himself to be receptive to the interests of a wide range of constituents and a potential ally of sportsmen and other outdoor recreationists.\n\"Charged with administering significant federal lands and natural resources, the Interior secretary is possibly the most powerful individual in the country when it comes to the future of our cherished public lands and waters, fish and wildlife and outdoor traditions.\n\"We're gratified that the Trump administration is listening to our concerns and showing a willingness to act in the best interests of the American people and our irreplaceable public lands legacy.\"\nBHA National Board Chair Ryan Busse:\n\"Montana sportsmen have welcomed opportunities to engage with Representative Zinke during his work on behalf of Montanans as a member of Congress. We appreciate his efforts to keep public lands public and to strongly fund cornerstone natural resources programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund; at the same time, we are committed to ensuring that fish and wildlife and their habitats are considered priorities with competing uses of our public lands. We look forward to continuing to work closely with Mr. Zinke as Interior secretary.\"\nWhit Fosburgh, President, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership:\n\"He's shown courage and commitment to public lands and conservation and [is] someone we think would be an excellent secretary of interior.\" (Washington Post)\nIndependent Petroleum Association of America President and CEO Barry Russell:\n\"We're pleased with President-elect Trump's selection of Congressman Ryan Zinke, a former Navy SEAL commander, for the position of Secretary of the Interior. The Interior Secretary is our nation's strongest advocate for protecting and actively harnessing more than 500 million acres of federal land and natural resources for the benefit of all Americans. Nobody values the importance of public land use better than a Westerner. As a conservationist hailing from the energy-producing state of Montana, Congressman Zinke understands the critical role that the Interior Department plays in balancing the effective management of our nation's lands and waters with multiple use policies that open access to the public for conservation, recreational opportunities, job-creating economic activities, and safe, responsible energy development. IPAA looks forward to continuing to work with Congressman Zinke in his new role as Interior Secretary and collaborate together on new ways to grow our economy, while improving the environment and enhancing life for all Americans.\"\nAmerican Petroleum Institute President and CEO Jack Gerard:\n\"As a member of the House Natural Resources Committee and a fifth generation Montanan, Congressman Zinke knows the great potential that our federal lands hold when it comes to developing our nation's energy resources, and he knows that this is good for American jobs and strengthening our national security,\" said Gerard. \"As a former member of our armed forces who served as a U.S. Navy Seal for over two decades, Congressman Zinke knows that our nation's energy security and national security are dependent upon each other.\n\"We look forward to working with Congressman Zinke is his new role on policies that will keep energy affordable, create jobs, and protect our environment as we lead the world in the production and refining of oil and natural gas while reducing carbon emissions.\"", "timestamp": "2016-12-15", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying...Praise for Congressman Ryan Zinke as Secretary of Interior"}

For 14 years, he led the State of Texas, and with low taxes, restrained spending, and limited regulation, Texas became one of the greatest economic powerhouses in the world. His executive experience across diverse policy areas makes him qualified to run just about any federal agency. Gov. Perry is an exceptional pick to head the Department of Energy, and after presiding over the nation's number one producer of oil and natural gas, and one of the nation's leaders in wind, solar, and nuclear energy, he understands the importance of our country's energy resources not only to our economy, but also to our national security.

Perry understands the abundance of our domestic energy resources and what it takes to power our complex and growing economy. I am confident that under his leadership, the DOE will be right sized and focused intently on its twin goals of national security and energy independence.

I congratulate my good friend Rick Perry on his nomination and look forward to working with him.\"\nSalo Zelermyer, former Senior Counsel at the Energy Department:\n\"It is indeed possible to successfully balance appropriate environmental regulations with domestic energy production and use.\n\"During his time in office, Perry embodied the type of 'all of the above' approach to U.S. energy production that many have advocated on both sides of the aisle. Rick Perry's Texas was not only a world leader in oil and gas production; it was also a global leader in wind power and renewable energy investment. This approach is a big reason Texas experienced such enormous job growth during Perry's tenure.\" (Washington Post)\nT. Boone Pickens:\n\"Rick Perry is a friend. He was a great Texas governor, and I believe he will be a great Secretary of Energy.\n\"Believe me, the man understands energy. He's been a long-serving Texas governor who has witnessed first-hand what natural gas and oil mean to the state and national economies and the workforce.\n\"He also presided over Texas during a time in which deregulation and transmission projects enabled wind energy production in the state to grow from 184 megawatts of installed capacity in the year 2000 to over 14,000 megawatts at the end of 2014. Texas continues to be the largest producer of wind energy with now over 17,700 megawatts of installed capacity followed by Iowa with 6,200 megawatts of wind energy.\n\"He understands what happens to the oil and gas industry with too much government regulation and he understands how important domestic production is to our economy and our national security.\"\nTom Kiernan, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association:\n\"He increased the ambition of the state's Renewable Energy Standard, directed state funds to innovative wind energy R&D initiatives, and created a 'Competitive Renewable Energy Zone' that helped expand transmission of renewables, bringing clean wind energy from rural communities to new state markets.\" (Science Mag)\nLarry Faulkner, professor of chemistry and president emeritus of the University of Texas in Austin:\n\"I found him to be interested in scientific research and technical innovation and to be willing to support investment in them. His interest was usually driven by the possibilities for economic opportunity for the state, which is not surprising for a governor.\" (Science Mag)\nKen Kimmell, President of the Union of Concerned Scientists:\n\"As governor of Texas, Mr. Perry saw the job creation and business opportunity provided by clean energy, helping to turn Texas into the national leader in wind power. In fact, he increased the ambition of the state's Renewable Energy Standard, directed state funds to innovative wind energy R&D initiatives, and created a 'Competitive Renewable Energy Zone' that helped expand transmission of renewables, bringing clean wind energy from rural communities to new state markets.\n\"We hope as DOE secretary, Governor Perry builds on the successful work currently underway at the agency in areas like grid modernization, energy efficiency, and clean energy finance. Most important is that he supports the agency's critical work on clean energy R&D, which has helped create jobs by improving the cost and performance of renewable energy technologies, and help develop and commercialize new, innovative clean energy technologies.\"\nHerman Cain:\n\"His 14-year track record governing the state of Texas - with its aggressive and smart use of natural resources and its general tendency to avoid crony capitalism - has established the state as an economic model for the rest of the nation.\"\nGeorge P.

American energy will fuel an American jobs resurgence.\"\nJim DeMint, Heritage Foundation President:\n\"Governor Perry's commitment to free-markets, limited government and a stronger America, make him an exceptional choice to head the Department of Energy. While the department plays a critical role in our nuclear weapons program, its vast loan programs, crippling regulatory actions, and market interventions represent the federal government overreach that Americans sharply rejected in November.\n\"For well over a decade, Governor Perry successfully led the state of Texas - one of the world's largest economies - with a confident conservative vision that created millions of new American jobs.\n\"I am confident Governor Perry will fight to keep America's nuclear deterrent strong while also reining in the department's overreaches - allowing Americans to once again determine their own energy futures.\"", "timestamp": "2016-12-14", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying...Praise for Former Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy"}

Three years later he was named president of Exxon Yemen Inc. and Esso Exploration and Production Khorat Inc., and in January 1998, he was promoted to vice president of Exxon Ventures (CIS) Inc. and president of Exxon Neftegas Limited. In those roles, he was responsible for Exxon's holdings in Russia and the Caspian Sea as well as the Sakhalin I consortium operations offshore Sakhalin Island, Russia.\nIn December 1999, he became executive vice president of Exxon Mobil Development Company. Mr. Tillerson was then named senior vice president of Exxon Mobil Corporation in August 2001, and was elected president of the corporation and member of the board of directors on March 1, 2004.

Groomed for an executive position, Tillerson came up in the rough-and-tumble world of oil production, holding posts in the company's central United States, Yemen and Russian operations.\n...\nIn 2006, Tillerson won the battle to succeed former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond. Under the Texan's leadership, oil prices broke records and Exxon's profits helped make it the most valuable public company in the world, with a security force totaling thousands of employees, direct channels with governments worldwide and a strong aversion to American sanctions or limitations on where it could operate.\nTillerson has used Exxon's enormous profits to explore new regions for oil and gas and to invest in new acquisitions like XTO Resources, a company that had helped pioneer drilling for natural gas in formations of shale in the United States. But over the years oil has become more difficult and expensive to find as large, easy-to-tap reservoirs in stable countries were slowly depleted. Exxon and other giant oil corporations found it ever more difficult to replace the oil they sold every day with new resources, and they were forced to look in every more difficult and hostile regions for oil and gas.\n...\nBut he said it's clear the risks of climate change to society and ecosystems could be significant, and it's prudent to develop and implement \"sensible strategies that address these risks while not reducing our ability to progress other global priorities such as economic development, poverty eradication and public health.\"\n...\nOutside the oil industry, Tillerson has served as director of the United Negro College Fund and as chairman of the American Petroleum Institute.

Today, Puzder released the following statement on American workers, immigration, and his plans for the Labor Department:\n\"My job as a business person is to maximize profits for my company, employees and shareholders. My job as the Secretary of Labor, if confirmed, is to serve U.S. citizen workers – that is my moral and constitutional duty. The public spoke loud and clear in this election, and delivered a mandate to protect American workers. It makes no economic sense to spend trillions on welfare and jobless benefits for out of work Americans while bringing in foreign workers to fill jobs in their place.\n\"As Secretary of Labor, I will fiercely defend American workers and implement my piece of the ten point plan the President-elect laid out. President-elect Trump's plan to establish new immigration controls will boost wages and ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. Hire American and Buy American is our policy, and the one supported by voters in both parties. I will not provide guest worker visas to companies that break the rules, and will support reforms to raise wages for Americans -- I know the system from the inside, and will be the best champion American workers have had. With 94 million Americans outside the labor force, and massive unemployment in our inner cities and among minority workers, my job will be to help these workers find jobs. We also have large unemployment in our immigrant communities, and these communities benefit the most from clamping down on guest worker programs that compete against them.\"", "timestamp": "2016-12-10", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: Puzder: I Will Fiercely Defend American Workers as Secretary of Labor"}

This perspective gives him a different set of qualifications than the typical Washington insider. We are hopeful that, if confirmed by the Senate, a top priority will be rolling back the damaging effects caused by the expansion of joint employer liability to America's 733,000 franchise businesses, and the too-far, too-fast increase in the overtime threshold that was recently put on hold by a Texas judge.\n\"At the same time, Puzder will be able to champion how the franchise business model, which generates a higher percentage of new jobs in the economy than non-franchises, are a key part of the solution to wage growth and upward mobility that so many voters are looking for out of policymakers in Washington.\"\nJuanita Duggan, President and CEO of the National Federation of Independent Business\n\"Small business owners are pleased that someone who knows what it takes to manage a successful company has been nominated to oversee the Department of Labor. Many NFIB members are franchisees, a business model that was under attack during the Obama administration. Andy Puzder understands how these actions and other labor regulations directly harm American entrepreneurs and family businesses. NFIB has multiple suits against harmful Department of Labor regulations rushed out at the end of the President Obama's term. We are hopeful that should the nominees be confirmed; he will take immediate action to halt these overreaching rules. President-elect Trump has made a good choice for this critical cabinet position.\"\nDawn Sweeney, CEO of the National Restaurant Association\n\"Andy Puzder brings much-needed business experience to the Department of Labor. He has a proven track record of turning around businesses, and his background in the restaurant industry will help foster an environment for job creation.\"\nRob Green, Executive Director of the National Council of Chain Restaurants\n\"We are very pleased that President-elect Trump has chosen a nominee with the experience, knowledge and unique leadership skills necessary for this important position. Once confirmed, Mr. Puzder will be an effective advocate for balanced federal policy at the Labor Department. That benefits all stakeholders — including chain restaurants, small businesses and their employees around the country.\"\nDavid French, Senior Vice President for Government Relations, National Retail Federation\n\"Careers in retail and restaurants offer a path forward for millions of Americans, and hiring an employer from this sector for the important role of labor secretary would show that President-elect Trump knows the value of these opportunities. Andrew Puzder is someone with the real-world experience to understand workforce issues and how jobs are created. Mr. Puzder has been an ally in our efforts to emphasize the dynamic careers available in the retail and restaurant industries, and he would bring to the job his experience in balancing the needs of all stakeholders in the American workforce. NRF is committed to long-term investments in workforce development and we look forward to working with him to advance a strong pro-jobs agenda in Washington.\"\nAlfredo Ortiz, President, Job Creators Network\n\"Mr. Puzder would provide welcome relief for the small business community that has had to endure years of regulatory assault.

As someone who has worked with CKE for more than three decades – from a restaurant crew member, to my current position as COO – I have personally witnessed the leadership Andy has demonstrated since he became CEO in 2000. He has always led CKE as an entrepreneurial company maintaining a focus on hard work and motivation instead of bureaucracy and red tape. Andy is someone who understands workers, their motivation, and what employees need in terms of job fulfillment and opportunities. Andy's leadership has provided growth opportunities for me and many others within our organization, and I know he will be steadfast in promoting the welfare and success of all hard working American citizens in this new role.\"\nTroi Wierdsma, Carl's Jr. Owner in San Francisco\n\"Andy Puzder's nomination as Secretary of Labor has given me even more faith in President-elect Trump's commitment to leading America back to prosperity. I have seen numerous positive character traits in Andy while working with him at Carl's Jr as a restaurant owner and franchisee for the past 13 years: he is solid on his word, sincere in his approach, and very driven to overcome whatever challenges may come his way.

For years, Scott has been the go-to leader in resisting the Obama EPA's regulatory overreach. By standing up to unwarranted and unlawful policies, he has demonstrated rightful concern for Americans whose livelihoods and communities have suffered under intrusive, job-killing regulations. Under Scott's leadership, I have confidence we can implement commonsense policies that protect both our environment and our economy.\"\nU.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK)\n\"Scott Pruitt has been a leader and a partner on environmental issues for many years, said Inhofe. Pruitt has fought back against unconstitutional and overzealous environmental regulations like Waters of the U.S. and the Clean Power Plan; he has proven that being a good steward of the environment does not mean burdening tax payers and businesses with red tape. In his appearances before the Environment and Public Works committee, Pruitt has demonstrated that he is an expert on environmental laws and a champion of states' roles in implementing those laws. Scott is thoughtful, experienced and a natural pick for this role. I am pleased with President-elect Trump's selection and I look forward to working with my fellow Oklahoman in his new capacity.\"\nU.S. Senator James Lankford (R-OK)\n\"I applaud President-elect Trump and his team for choosing Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said Lankford. Pruitt has served Oklahoma as a tireless defender of justice and law, and I am confident that he will serve America well. I look forward to working with him to restore a balanced approach to regulations and governance that fosters economic growth, advances energy independence and ensures stewardship for the environment. Scott Pruitt knows the difference between a state responsibility and a federal responsibility. The American people deserve an EPA that rejects extreme activism and instead returns to its proper interpretation of environmental law.\"\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott\n\"President-elect Trump's selection of Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the EPA proves he is serious about creating jobs and rolling back the burdensome regulations implemented by the Obama administration. As Attorneys General, Scott and I sued the EPA on several occasions as it continually ignored the Constitution and sought to implement rules, fees and regulations without congressional oversight or approval. I look forward to working with Scott as he brings common-sense policies to a federal agency that has been one of the biggest job-killers in the Obama administration.\"\nKentucky Governor Matt Bevin\n\"The small business owners, coal miners, and all the hard working people of Kentucky are very pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Scott Pruitt as EPA Administrator. This nomination proves that the President-elect is listening to the American people who want fewer overbearing government regulation from Washington D.C. and more jobs on main street USA. Just like he has done in Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt will fight for the working people and job creators, while ensuring that the air and water are clean and safe.\"\nLuther Strange, Chairman, Republican Attorneys General Association\n\"President-elect Trump could not have made a better choice than Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA. General Pruitt has been at the front lines of the fight against federal overregulation, including the unconstitutional Clean Power Plan. He understands the need to protect our environment while also allowing responsible development of our vast natural resources. RAGA is losing a valued member, but the country is gaining a talented individual who will help President Trump restore America's economic strength.\"\nMike Turpen, Former Oklahoma Attorney General\n\"I've worked with Scott Pruitt on a wide variety of issues since he became Oklahoma's Attorney General. I especially remember his opinion a couple of years ago in which he turned back a political challenge to the Oklahoma's Promise scholarship program run by the Oklahoma Regents for Higher Education, a Board on which I serve. I have dealt with General Pruitt on a wide variety of other issues as well. In all of my dealings with General Pruitt I have found him to be an honorable man, a good family man, and a man of genuine spirituality.\n\"I can't say that I've followed everything that General Pruitt has done, but have always found him hard-working, honest, upbeat, and graced with a fine sense of humor. Scott is my friend, and I'm proud of his accomplishments and his upcoming appointment to administer the Environmental Protection Agency. I believe he will be fair minded and diligent in the performance of his duties. He will do Oklahoma and our Nation proud.\"\nLeslie Rutledge, Arkansas Attorney General\n\"Attorney General Pruitt has been a leader in fighting the over regulation that has been coming from the EPA for many years, said Attorney General Rutledge. I am confident that my friend, mentor and partner in this fight to combat unlawful regulations, General Pruitt, will be a great fit to bring much needed reforms to the EPA and make sure the agency is acting within the scope of the law. I want to see common sense regulations put in place that not only protect our environment but that allow farmers to feed the world and business owners to grow jobs across Arkansas and the country, and I know General Pruitt will make that happen.\"\nPatrick Morrisey, Attorney General of West Virginia\n\"My friend and fellow Attorney General Scott Pruitt would be an outstanding EPA Administrator. He's smart, principled, and the right person to reverse the EPA's unlawful actions that have hurt small business, job creation and states' rights. As the AG for a state like mine with bountiful natural resources, in Oklahoma Scott Pruitt has proven you can protect the environment and people's jobs at the same time.\"\nNan Hayworth, Board of Directors, ConservAmerica and former Member House of Representatives (R-NY)\n\"Scott Pruitt is very much in the mold of our nation's first environmentalist President, Theodore Roosevelt--an outdoorsman who understands the critical importance of stewardship. As head of the Environmental Protection Agency--which was founded by a Republican administration--Mr. Pruitt will be a strong partner for President Trump in effectively balancing protection of America's land, water, air, and wildlife with economic prosperity.\"\nOklahoma House Speaker-designate Charles A. McCall\n\"Today's announcement is incredible news not only for Oklahoma, but also for everyone across this nation that believes that states are sovereign and federal power is limited. Attorney General Scott Pruitt has been a champion for freedom and for Oklahoma for the last six years. As a citizen of one of the nation's leading energy producing states, I am excited for Oklahoma and for Scott, and I cannot think of a better choice for our nation at this critical agency.\"\nSenator Greg Treat, the Majority Floor Leader of the Oklahoma State Senate\n\"Because of the leadership of Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma has been the point of the spear in the fight against the unlawful and unconstitutional overreach of the EPA the past eight years. I've worked alongside Scott in recent years specifically to push back on the Clean Power Plan, and the EPA's attempt to circumvent Congress and the authority of the states to regulate and conserve their natural resources. No one is more qualified or better suited than Scott Pruitt to reign in the EPA, and restore balance to the agency's relationships with Congress, the states, and private industry. It certainly is great news for Oklahoma that one of our own has been appointed to a leadership position in the Trump administration, but it's even better news for our nation and the rule of law that Scott Pruitt will lead the EPA.\"", "timestamp": "2016-12-08", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying...Praise for President-Elect Donald J.

As the long-time governor of Iowa, he understands the global nature of the state and national economies. Governor Branstad understands China, having been there on numerous trade missions and having a friendship with President Xi Jinping. He's the longest-serving governor in our nation's history. Iowans have chosen him for his successful track record as the chief executive, his trustworthiness and his reputation as a straight shooter. Those attributes would serve the United States very well if he's confirmed for this position. He ought to be confirmed very easily.\"\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-IA)\n\"President-elect Trump has made an excellent choice in nominating Governor Terry Branstad as the United States Ambassador to China; his experience with China speaks for itself and he will excel in this new role,\" stated Ernst. \"Having worked alongside the Governor for many years, I know he will exemplify the same leadership, thoughtfulness, and dedication in his role as Ambassador to China on behalf of the United States as he did for the people of Iowa. I'd like to congratulate Terry, his wife Chris, and their children, and wish them the very best as they embark on this new adventure.\"\nLu Kang, Spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, People's Republic of China\n\"Mr. Branstad is an old friend of the Chinese people and we welcome him to play a greater role in promoting Sino-US relations. The US ambassador to China is an important bridge between the US government and the Chinese government.\"\nThe Republican Governor's Association\n\"Governor Terry Branstad is an exceptional choice by President-elect Trump to represent America as U.S. Ambassador to China,\" said RGA Chairman Governor Scott Walker. \"In his nearly 22 years as Iowa's chief executive, Governor Branstad has consistently strengthened his state, and now as our nation's top liaison to China, he'll help strengthen American interests abroad. The RGA congratulates Governor Branstad on his selection and looks forward to his leadership on the world stage.\nPaul E. Schickler, President, DuPont Pioneer\n\"Governor Branstad is a smart choice for U.S. Ambassador to China. It will be good for the United States, good for China and good for Iowa. The governor brings two important strengths to this role: strong existing relationships with China at multiple levels and experience as a leading advocate for trade. These strengths will benefit international commerce and help further advance China's goal of modernizing its agricultural industry. I fully support Senate approval of the governor's appointment.\"\nJay Timmons, President and CEO of National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)\n\"Terry Branstad is the perfect pick for this important position. Working closely with Gov. Branstad and his outstanding team for many years, I know he is a man true to his word and has been tested over and over again as Iowa's chief executive, said Timmons. From leading his state out of tough economic times to balancing Iowa's budget, he understands what manufacturers and businesses need to invest and grow—and has a proven record of results.\n\"The governor's deep understanding of China, and close relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, uniquely qualifies him for this vital post. For manufacturers, China stands as one of our largest trade and investment partners, but it is also a major challenge, imposing a range of market-distorting policies and practices that impact manufacturers in the United States, said Timmons. I have full confidence that Gov. Branstad will help forge a strong U.S.–China relationship that is based on the principles of fairness, respect and, most importantly, the rule of law. He understands that manufacturers are committed to building meaningful ties with China—but will not settle for anything less than a free and fair competitive landscape where both countries are playing by the same rules.\"\nMary Andringa, Chairman of the Board of Vermeer Corporation\n\"As the leader of an Iowa-based equipment manufacturer, I have worked closely with Gov. Branstad over the course of his many years of service to the state of Iowa,\" said Andringa. \"The governor is a pragmatic and inclusive leader who knows how to bring people together to solve problems and pursue opportunities. He has more than 30 years of experience working closely with Chinese leaders and has proudly hosted them in Iowa on numerous occasions. The governor knows the importance of a strong and constructive relationship with one of our largest trading partners, and he has the experience needed to represent us effectively in Beijing.\"\nSiva Yam, President, U.S. - China Chamber of Commerce\n\"Governor Terry Branstad is an excellent choice. President Xi Jinping lived in Iowa for three weeks, and he has a special relationship with Governor Branstad and a passion for the State of Iowa. Governor Branstad has made a number of trips to China and visited President Xi on a number of occasions. China is in the heart of Governor Branstad, and he understands how important China is for the U.S. In a country that personal relationship (Guanxi) is paramount, this will help to bridge the differences between the two greatest nations in the world. I can tell you that this is an excellent choice that could only be made with in-depth research and good understanding of the socio-political elements.\"\nNeil Dierks, CEO of the National Pork Producers Council\n\"I have no doubt that Gov. Branstad will be a great ambassador to China, and with his background, it will be good for our industry, good for agriculture and good for rural America and the country at large. President-elect Trump couldn't have made a better pick for this important post.\"\nRobert Hormats, Former Under - Secretary of State\n\"It's a good pick because he knows President Xi, he can represent the heartland of the United States, which I think is very positive, and the fact that President Xi has been in his state twice is a very positive thing…It creates a personal relationship that is very hard to replicate.\"", "timestamp": "2016-12-07", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying: Leaders Praise President-Elect Trump's Nomination of Governor Terry Branstad to be Ambassador of China"}

Among the most decorated and legendary leaders in our country, Gen. Mattis has spent his life defending America in numerous theaters of war.\nGen. Mattis commanded at multiple levels during his 44 year career as an infantry Marine. Before retiring in 2013, he was the Commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), directing military operations of more than 200,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, Coast Guardsmen, and Marines across the Middle East. Gen. Mattis has been at the forefront of the development of our nation's counterinsurgency tactics, and has earned accolades for his ferocity, intellect and dedication, making him one of the foremost defense experts in the world.\n\"I am proud to nominate General James Mattis to Secretary of Defense,\" said President-elect Trump. \"He is one of the most effective generals and extraordinary leaders of our time, who has committed his life to his love for our country. General Mattis is the living embodiment of the Marine Corps motto, 'Semper Fidelis,' always faithful, and the American people are fortunate that a man of his character and integrity will now be the civilian leader atop the Department of Defense. Under his leadership, we will rebuild our military and alliances, destroy terrorists and face our enemies head on, and make America safe again.\"\n\"I am honored by President-elect Trump's nomination and his respect for the brave men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States,\" said Gen. Mattis. \"To the President-elect, our soon to be commander in chief, to our military personnel, to the talented civilians in the Department of Defense, and to the American people, I pledge the best of my abilities to ensuring a strong and secure America.\"\nGen. Mattis is a native of Pullman, Washington. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Central Washington University and was commissioned a second lieutenant through ROTC in 1972.\nAs a lieutenant colonel, Gen. Mattis commanded an assault battalion breaching the Iraqi minefields in Operation Desert Storm. As a colonel, he commanded the 7th Marine Regiment and, on Pentagon duty, he served as the Department of Defense Executive Secretary. As a brigadier general he was the Senior Military Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Defense.\nFollowing the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Gen. Mattis, led the Special Operation Forces against the Taliban in Afghanistan. As a major general, he commanded the First Marine Division during the initial attack and subsequent stability operations in Iraq. As a general, he served concurrently as the Commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command and as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander for Transformation.\nAs a two-star general, Gen. Mattis led the First Marine Division from Kuwait to Baghdad in a matter of weeks in 2003, annihilating Saddam Hussein's defenses and reaching Baghdad faster and with fewer losses than anyone could have expected.\nIn November 2007, Gen. Mattis was promoted to four-star general. He became Commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) in 2010 and directed operations across the Middle East before retiring in 2013. Working closely with Gen. Petraeus, Gen. Mattis produced the revolutionary Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual, the definitive work on how the U.S. military should deal with Iraqi insurgents.

James N. Mattis to be secretary of defense so soon after taking off his military uniform. But President Obama's former defense secretary Leon Panetta believes Mattis should get the waiver and the job, he told me in an interview.\n\"It's important that the Congress in the process of providing that waiver makes sure that Jim Mattis understands that he has to play a role not just on the military side but also on the civilian side. I think he does,\" Panetta told me on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense Forum on Saturday.\nPanetta also said the 1947 law mandating that a defense secretary be out of uniform for 10 years — later changed to seven — was \"arbitrary\" and was crafted in a different era when generals had a singular role as war fighters, whereas today's generals have more diverse roles.\n...\nPanetta told me that Mattis often differed with the Obama White House on policy and wasn't shy about it. He often called internally for more military presence in the Middle East to send signals to Iran. Sometimes Obama accepted his recommendations and sometimes he did not.\nFor example, after Iran shot down an American drone in 2011, Mattis recommended Obama send fighter escorts for drone flights to show the Iranians such moves were unacceptable and Obama agreed. But in 2012 Mattis wanted a third aircraft carrier group deployed in the region to respond to Iranian maritime aggression in the Strait of Hormuz, something the White House rejected.\n\"Sometimes his attitude rubbed some people in the White House the wrong way, because he was aggressive,\" said Panetta. \"It never made him hesitate to keep saying what he believed was necessary.

Instead, we will negotiate fair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores.\nOn energy, I will cancel job-killing restrictions on the production of American energy – including shale energy and clean coal – creating many millions of high-paying jobs. That's what we want, that's what we've been waiting for.\nOn regulation, I will formulate a rule which says that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated, it's so important.\nOn national security, I will ask the Department of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop a comprehensive plan to protect America's vital infrastructure from cyber-attacks, and all other form of attacks.\nOn immigration, I will direct the Department of Labor to investigate all abuses of visa programs that undercut the American worker.\nOn ethics reform, as part of our plan to Drain the Swamp, we will impose a five-year ban on executive officials becoming lobbyists after they leave the Administration – and a lifetime ban on executive officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\nThese are just a few of the steps we will take to reform Washington and rebuild our middle class.\nI will provide more updates in the coming days, as we work together to Make America Great Again for everyone.", "timestamp": "2016-11-21", "title": "A Video Message from President-Elect Donald J.

Trump's nomination of U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General.\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT...\nFormer Deputy Attorney General of the United States under President George W. Bush Larry Thompson: \"I can tell you as a friend and someone who has known Jeff Sessions for 32 years that Jeff does not have a racist bone in his body. When I first met Jeff, he was U.S. Attorney in Mobile and I was the U.S. Attorney in Atlanta. In order to stretch our limited per diems on travel to Department of Justice conferences, we often booked single rooms with double beds in hotels. You really get to know a person when you interact so closely with them.\n\"When I was asked by Attorney General William French Smith to head the Southeastern Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force simply because of my strategic location in Atlanta, a delicate situation was presented. The Task Force consisted of eleven other U.S. Attorney Offices but any potential problem was avoided because Jeff rallied the other U.S. Attorneys around our common cause and my leadership.\n\"As a former federal prosecutor, Jeff knows the workings of the Justice Department inside and out. He is thoroughly familiar with the legal issues the Department will face. He understands the mission of the Department and will carry out his duties in a professional, thoughtful, and balanced manner. More recently, Jeff voted to confirm President Obama's choice as Attorney General, Eric Holder.\n\"By the way, I have been an African American for 71 years and I think I know a racist when I experience one. Jeff Sessions is simply a good and decent man.\"\nFormer Attorney General John Ashcroft: \"The political 'drive-by-assassins' who have trotted out the 30-year-old fabrication of racism are utterly devoid of the truth. When attackers resort to 30-year-old falsehoods it is clear evidence of their lack of substantive objection.\n\"Jeff is devoted to the proposition that equity before the law and in our society is at the heart and soul of what it means to be American. Nothing so completely rivals the injustice of racism more profoundly than the reckless labelling of persons who are not.\n\"Jeff Sessions has earned the trust of America with over three decades of fair and equitable service to the entirety of our culture. He deserves our commendation and support, not conjured, baseless attacks.\"\nU.S. Civil Rights Commissioner Peter Kirsanow: \"Senator Sessions is a good man and a great man. He has done more to protect the jobs and enhance the wages of black workers than anyone in either house of Congress over the last 10 years. Of all the Senators and public officials that I've dealt with, I cannot think of anyone who has been more devoted to issues related to wages and employment levels of all Americans, but particularly black American workers.\n\"[Senator Sessions] is a man of tremendous integrity. I think it was an inspired pick. He's going to be a marvelous Attorney General.\n\"It's scandalous that they're trying to say he's a racist. They are trying to demonize the Alabama of 2016 as somehow being the Alabama of 1946. And they are trying to similarly falsely caricature Sen. Sessions. But that is not the case. I've gotten the opportunity to deal with him on a regular basis and he is a wonderful human being.\"\nCivil Rights Attorney and founder of the Black American Leadership Alliance Leah Durant: \"Senator Sessions has been a leader in the fight for preserving American jobs and ensuring opportunities for African American workers.\"\nRobert N. Driscoll, managing partner, McGlinchey Stafford, Washington, D.C., and former deputy assistant attorney general in the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: \"Senator Sessions could be a good attorney general for civil rights because he will be driven by the law. His interpretation of the law will not please everyone, but I predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor. Clear cases will be prosecuted with vigor. Creative interpretations of the law may cease, but the meat-and-potatoes work of the division (intentional discrimination, police misconduct, disability law) will continue apace, conducted without impropriety or political favoritism. That alone will be a breath of fresh air.\"\nNational Sheriffs' Association: \"Senator Sessions would be an outstanding nominee for U.S. Attorney General. Sen. Sessions has enormous integrity, fidelity to the rule of law, substantial experience and a commitment to fairness and equal justice under the law. Those are qualities America needs as its chief law enforcement officer to the Federal Government.\n\"Throughout his career, Senator Sessions has steadfastly supported the men and women who risk their lives every day to preserve the rule of law. Senator Sessions is an experienced prosecutor with a world-class legal mind, serving as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, Alabama Attorney General and for two decades on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees the Department of Justice.\n\"Senator Sessions would be an extraordinary Attorney General and we're hopeful the new administration nominates him and the U.S. Senate quickly confirms.\"\nNational District Attorneys Association (NDAA): \"Today, the National District Attorneys Association, representing 2,500 diverse Republican and Democratic elected prosecutors and their 40,000 assistants, formally endorsed Senator Jeff Sessions from the State of Alabama to be the 84th Attorney General of the United States. Rarely in the history of this great country has a candidate been more qualified to serve in this capacity in an effort to promote and protect public safety.\n\"The breadth of Senator Sessions experience is vast. Born in Selma, Alabama to hard working parents who operated a general store, the Senator was educated at Huntington College in Montgomery and received his law degree from the University of Alabama in 1973.\n\"Manifesting an early interest in public service, Sessions became a U.S. Army Reservist, eventually reaching the rank of Captain. He was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama in 1981, a post he held with distinction for 12 years. He was elected Alabama Attorney General in 1994 and served until his election to the United States Senate in 1996, where he has served his state and country until today. His background in both state and federal prosecution makes him uniquely qualified to be our nation's top law enforcement official.\n\"While in the Senate, Senator Sessions has fought tirelessly in support of prosecutors and crime victims through his efforts to maintain the ability of law enforcement and prosecutors to seize the illgotten gains of criminal enterprises and, perhaps most impressively, his efforts to champion the cause of our most vulnerable victims, namely children devastated by the evils of physical and sexual abuse.\"\nOn his nomination, NDAA Alabama State Director Steve Marshall said, \"Jeff Sessions has been a passionate advocate for criminal justice issues shown through his full support of law enforcement and prosecutors across the country. He will serve us well as this country's next Attorney General.\"\nMajor County Sheriffs' Association (MCSA): \"Your service and knowledgeable experience within the field of criminal justice makes you a uniquely qualified candidate and will undoubtedly serve you well.\n\"Expected to lead the U.S. Department of Justice on issues from tackling complex organized crime and cyber-threats, to sophisticated fraud and terrorism, the Attorney General of the United States requires not only a strong command of all justice concerns, but the ability to work cooperatively and closely with a broad community of law enforcement agencies and leaders across the country. Within the current Administration, there has been a continued pattern of making critical decisions affecting the law enforcement community without adequate stakeholder consultation. Issues range from the acquisition of military surplus equipment to immigration enforcement and asset forfeiture.\n\"You have continued to be a strong advocate for law enforcement and we sincerely thank you for your hard work and commitment to public safety. As an association of elected sheriffs representing our nation's largest counties with populations of 500,000 people or more, serving over 100 million Americans, we seek to be a positive source of ideas and solutions and you have been a reliable and valuable partner of the MCSA.\"\nNational Association of Police Organizations, Inc. (NAPO): \"You have been a voice for law enforcement on many issues facing our community as a Senator and member of the Judiciary Community and we look forward to continue working with you on these issues as the head of the Department of Justice. We are proud to offer you our whole-hearted support.\n\"NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from across the United States that serves to advance the interests of America's law enforcement officers. Founded in 1978, NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and associations, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and more than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to fair and effective crime control and law enforcement.\n\"NAPO has enjoyed working with you and having your support on many of our priority legislation, including the Thin Blue Line Act and the Lifesaving Gear for Police Act. As this nation is experiencing an increase in the number of assaults on law enforcement officers, these two bills are essential to protecting the lives of officers. We hope to see President Obama's Executive Order 13688 restricting law enforcement's access to surplus military equipment overturned by President Trump.\n\"You have shown a strong understanding of law enforcement's needs, as further exemplified by your amendment to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act Amendments Act to include emergency exceptions to the warrant requirement. This understating is again illustrated by your opposition to the expansive Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act and your endorsement of the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act.

Trump intends to nominate him Attorney General of the United States.\nStatements of support from Senate colleagues, conservative policy groups, and leaders from the legal community came pouring in Friday. Here's what they're saying...\nKenyen R. Brown, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, President Obama appointee\n\"Jeff Sessions is a man of outstanding character with an impeccable reputation for integrity. I have no doubt that he will be an outstanding U.S. Attorney General. I wish him much success in this new leadership role in our nation.\"\nBarry F. Kowalski, Civil Rights Attorney and Former Special Counsel in the Civil Rights Division of United States Justice Department\n\"I worked closely with Senator Sessions while he was U.S. Attorney and I was in the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. This was during the 1980s when many southern U.S. Attorneys were not always welcoming to the Civil Rights Division working in their districts. However, Senator Sessions could not have been more supportive of our investigations, and in the Michael Donald case specifically, he personally contributed to making sure his killers were brought to justice.\"\nWilliam Smith, Chief of Staff to Congressman Gary Palmer, Chief Counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\"I had the opportunity to work with Senators Sessions for close to 10 years. Throughout that time, he was more a friend and confidant than the boss. I believe he hired me as the first-ever Republican African American Chief Counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee and I'm not sure there has been another one since me. After I moved to Alabama to practice law and then returned to Washington, Senator Sessions offered me the position of Chief Counsel on the full Judiciary Committee and then basically created a position for me on his Senate Budget Committee, where I continued as his Chief. Jeff Sessions is a man of high character and great integrity. He would make an outstanding Attorney General and I'm excited to support him 100%. Although I pushed the envelope a number of times, not once did Senator Sessions ever say anything to offend me. Instead, time after time, he stood by me and the conservative causes I was out to support. I remember spending several late nights in the office, not talking about working, but talking about life and family. Senator Sessions was always concerned for my well-being. Because he is such a great man, one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made was leaving his employment. In his kindness, he told me if I wanted to come back, I could. He, Mary and his children have treated me like family and I'll always be grateful for that.\"\nDr. Darrell Scott, Senior Pastor of New Spirit Revival Center Ministries\n\"I had the opportunity to get to know Sen. Jeff Sessions during President-elect Trump's successful campaign and can say unequivocally that he is a man of great character and integrity. I believe wholeheartedly that he will make an outstanding Attorney General and will ensure that all Americans receive equal justice.\"\nTexas State Representative James White\n\"This summer I had the opportunity to visit extensively with Sen. Jeff Sessions. I am impressed with his command of a host of issues from criminal justice, to national security, to jobs and the economy. His deep and sincere concern for working men and women in America is refreshing.\n\"Over the last two election cycles, I have not drawn a primary or general election opponent. I know firsthand that this occurs because of hard work, not happenstance. When I asked Sen. Sessions how did he managed to accomplish this the last time he was on the ballot in 2014, he told me that he decided a long time ago to \"listen less to the donor class\" and focus more on the people of Alabama. Running unopposed for the U.S. Senate means that Sen. Sessions is not just representing Alabama Republicans or some other specific group, instead he is serving ALL the people of the great State of Alabama; and he renewed my commitment to fight for the people of East Texas.\n\"This is the type of leadership that the American people are clamoring for and I applaud President-elect Trump's decision to nominate Sen. Session as our next Attorney General. As a fellow American, military veteran, conservative Republican elected official, and Southerner, I'm confident that as the attorney general, Jeff Sessions will serve with honor, uphold our Constitution, and exhibit fairness to all Americans.\"\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)\n\"I strongly support the President-elect's intention to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions to be the next United States Attorney General. Jeff is principled, forthright, and hardworking. He cares deeply about his country and the Department he will be nominated to lead. As a senator, he has worked tirelessly to safeguard the public and to improve the lives of Americans from all walks of life. Whether it was collaborating with our colleague Sen. Durbin to reduce sentencing disparities for certain drug offenses, teaming up with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy on landmark legislation to combat sexual assault in prison, or his many other achievements, Jeff has always looked out for the safety, security and freedoms of his constituents and the nation.\n\"I look forward to the Senate's fair and expeditious treatment of our colleague's forthcoming nomination, just as it promptly processed President Obama's first Attorney General nomination, which concluded with a timely up or down vote.\"\nU.S. Senate President Pro Tempore Orrin Hatch (R-UT)\n\"The Obama Justice Department veered away from its core mission and too often politicized enforcement of the law. Sen. Sessions has broad law enforcement experience at both the state and the federal levels, and in both the executive and the legislative branches. I am confident he will help get the Justice Department back on track. Having served with Sen. Sessions for many years on the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to supporting his nomination and working closely with him on important initiatives in the months ahead.\"\nU.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\"Sen. Sessions is a respected member and former Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee who has worked across the aisle on major legislation. He knows the Justice Department as a former U.S. attorney, which would serve him very well in this position. With this background, I'm confident he would be reported favorably out of the committee.\"\nLeonard Leo, Executive Vice President, The Federalist Society\n\"I have known Senator Jeff Sessions for nearly a quarter century and I can say emphatically that President Trump is picking a very good man for Attorney General. He has the independence, integrity, experience and commitment to human dignity that is so important in an Attorney General or any public servant charged with upholding the Constitution.\"\nU.S. Senator Susan Collins (R. Maine)\n\"He is an individual who works hard, believes in public service and acts with integrity. As a former U.S. attorney and former Alabama attorney general, Senator Sessions is well qualified and would serve our country well as United States Attorney General.\"\nU.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC)\n\"Sen. Sessions is a fine, decent man and principled conservative. I've known him for more than twenty years. He has the experience and ability to serve as Attorney General of the United States. He was an early supporter of Donald Trump in the Senate and he has earned the right to serve President-elect Trump and our nation at the highest level.\"\nU.S. Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ)\n\"Senator Sessions is well liked and well regarded, even by those who don't always agree with him. I look forward to supporting his nomination.\"\nU.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX)\n\"Sen. Jeff Sessions' nomination as attorney general is great news for all of us who revere the Constitution and the rule of law. I have been honored to work with Sen. Sessions on many of our nation's most important issues over the last four years. Sen. Sessions has had an extraordinary career in government and law enforcement. He has been an exemplary senator for the state of Alabama, and I am confident that he will be an exceptional United States attorney general.\"\nU.S. Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL)\n\"President-elect Trump has made an outstanding decision in selecting my friend and colleague Sen. Jeff Sessions to serve as our next U.S. Attorney General. Jeff is a man of integrity who has been a trusted and valued partner of mine in the Senate as well as an unwavering voice for Alabamians in Congress. With decades of experience in the legal field and an impressive tenure on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jeff will bring expertise to President-elect Trump's cabinet and the Department of Justice.\n\"I am confident that Jeff will continue to stand up for the American people, our Constitution, and the rule of law in this new role. My wife Annette and I wish him, his wife Mary, and his family the very best during this exciting time.\"\nU.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX)\n\"I commend the choice of Sen. Sessions to lead the Justice Department under the new Republican Administration. A principled and good man, he will restore honor to a Department that, under President Obama, perpetually pushed a political agenda while neglecting to enforce the law. For nearly eight years the Justice Department has twisted the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress to further the President's liberal agenda, eroding our liberty in the process. It has put politics ahead of national security, and demonized those who protect us. It's time to end the politicization of the Justice Department and start defending the rule of law, and I'm confident that as our top law enforcement official Senator Sessions will do that.\"\nU.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS)\n\"Sen. Jeff Sessions will be a champion for the Constitution and the rule of law. He will also provide sound counsel to President-elect Trump during the selection of Supreme Court nominees and other judicial appointments. For the past eight years, the Justice Department has eroded our nation's immigration laws, attacked our Second Amendment rights, and weakened religious liberty. It has been more concerned with pushing politics than administering the law. If confirmed, I am confident that Sen. Sessions can reverse that tide and help restore people's faith in their government.\nU.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK)\n\"I am encouraged to hear about President-elect Trump's nomination of my Senate colleague Sen. Jeff Sessions to be the next Attorney General of the United States. Sen. Sessions has a long record of exemplary public service, and is a passionate defender of our Constitution and the rule of law. I look forward to his confirmation and working with the next Attorney General in reestablishing constitutional principles that have been eviscerated by the current Administration.\"\nU.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA)\n\"Jeff's extensive legal career and experience make him a natural fit to lead our nation's Justice Department. His knowledge and dedication to our judicial system have been evident during my work with him on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I look forward to continue working with Jeff to make our country safer for all Americans.\"\nU.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC)\n\"Over the last two years, I've had the pleasure of calling Sen. Sessions my friend and colleague. While Sen. Sessions and I certainly don't agree on the specifics of every major issue, including immigration reform and criminal justice reform, he always expresses our policy differences in the form of productive and gracious exchanges of ideas. From my experience working with him on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, I consider him to be hands-down one of the fairest and most accessible chairmen of any congressional committee.\n\"These are some of the reasons Sen. Sessions is so well-liked by his colleagues, and respected by leaders of both parties. As Attorney General, he will follow the rule of law, be accessible, and address the organizational and accountability issues plaguing the Department of Justice, which are qualities and priorities that have unfortunately been missing from the department's leadership over the last eight years.\"\nU.S. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT)\n\"Sen. Sessions' solid understanding of the Constitution and firm commitment to the rule of law is exactly what the Justice Department needs. I have worked closely with Sen. Sessions on the Judiciary Committee over these past six years and I have every confidence that he will make a great Attorney General for all Americans.\"\nU.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK)\n\"I am pleased that President-elect Trump has announced his intention to nominate my good friend and colleague Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Sen. Sessions and I have worked closely together in the Senate for the last 20 years on the Armed Services and Environment & Public Works Committees. He is well respected on both sides of the aisle, in his home state of Alabama, and across the country. Sen. Session's experience as well as his deep respect for the rule of law leave no doubt in my mind that he is an excellent pick for attorney general.\"\nU.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY)\n\"For nine years, I have had the pleasure of working with Jeff Sessions in the Senate. He is well-respected by his colleagues and is unfailingly gracious to everyone. Jeff has been a strong advocate for our men and women in uniform, and for our nation's safety and security. He has also shown a willingness to listen to and work with senators on both sides of the aisle. I support his nomination to be the next Attorney General, and I look forward to his timely and fair hearing in the Senate.\"\nJim DeMint, former U.S. Senator and President of the Heritage Foundation\n\"No one will work harder than Jeff Sessions to defend the freedoms and safety of all Americans as Attorney General. He is not intimidated by the liberal media or the Washington establishment. He has the courage and the proven record to take on special interests. He is passionate about defending the Constitution and the rule of law to protect the rights of everyone. Jeff has been such a great friend to me and many others, becoming one of the most respected leaders in the Senate and should easily be confirmed.\"\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee\n\"Jeff Sessions great pick for AG. He was a bold voice to stop TPP when other GOP figures were ready to give away the country.\"\nPublic Interest Legal Foundation\n\"Sen. Sessions' record and respect for the rule of law makes him an excellent choice to lead the United States Department of Justice,\" said J. Christian Adams, President of the Public Interest Legal Foundation and former lawyer in the Voting Rights Section of the Department. \"Over the past 8 years, the Department of Justice has been derelict on its responsibilities to ensure free and fair elections across this nation, at times even contributing to the problem. We look forward to working with the Department to restore election integrity nationwide.\"\nNational Sheriffs' Association\n\"Sen. Sessions would be an outstanding nominee for U.S. Attorney General. Sen. Sessions has enormous integrity, fidelity to the rule of law, substantial experience and a commitment to fairness and equal justice under the law. Those are qualities America needs as its chief law enforcement officer to the Federal Government.\n\"Throughout his career, Sen. Sessions has steadfastly supported the men and women who risk their lives every day to preserve the rule of law. Sen. Sessions is an experienced prosecutor with a world-class legal mind, serving as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, Alabama Attorney General and for two decades on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees the Department of Justice.\n\"Sen. Sessions would be an extraordinary Attorney General and we're hopeful the new administration nominates him and the U.S. Senate quickly confirms.\"\nAmericans for Limited Government\n\"President-elect Donald Trump has made a strong statement that our Justice Department will return to following the rule of law through his appointment of Sen. Jeff Sessions to serve as the Attorney General. While soft-spoken, Sen. Sessions has the steel-willed determination to restore DOJ from its current corrupted partisanship by putting the blindfold back on Lady Justice as he enforces the law. Sessions will also help remove the stain of an Obama Justice Department that views itself more as political activists than neutral arbiters as has been witnessed by their legal war on local police and their failure to enforce immigration laws. The only potential down-side of Sen. Jeff Sessions' appointment is that when confirmed, the Senate will lose one of its great leaders who has met every challenge with integrity and quiet strength.\"\nSusan B. Anthony List (SBA List) president Marjorie Dannenfelser\n\"Sen. Jeff Sessions is a longtime ally of the pro-life movement with a 100 percent pro-life record. We look forward to working with him and supporting him as he enforces current and future pro-life laws, including those President-elect Trump has pledged to advance. A pro-life Attorney General will be a welcome change. The Obama Administration has consistently turned a blind eye to the abortion industry, led by Planned Parenthood, and their horrific involvement in the trafficking of baby body organs.\"\nPenny Nance, CEO & President of Concerned Women for America (CWA)\n\"Sen. Sessions has been a champion for the conservative principles that are the foundation of liberty and freedom. Both his academic preparation and his stellar career as a U.S. Attorney and as a senator testify of an honest, competent man with a heart towards serving his fellow countrymen, even through much personal sacrifice. We commend President-elect Trump for his selection of such a strong candidate. The choice speaks very highly of his commitment to conservative principles.\n\"The hundreds of thousands of members of Concerned Women for America (CWA) around the country will urge senators to move quickly in the new year to confirm Sen. Sessions as the next attorney general, so that we may start rectifying many of the asphyxiating policies pursued by Attorney General Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch. The attacks on religious freedom and freedom of conscience in general, for example, must be at the top of the list.\"", "timestamp": "2016-11-18", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying: President-elect Donald J.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119651", "text": "Stahl: Well, congratulations, Mr. Trump.\nPresident-elect Trump: Thank you.\nStahl: You're president-elect.\nPresident-elect Trump: Thank you.\nStahl: How surprised were you?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I really felt we were doing well. I was on a string of about 21 straight days of speeches, sometimes many a day and the last two days I really-- I really had a pretty wild time. I did six speeches and then I did seven and--\nStahl: But everyone thought you were going to lose.\nPresident-elect Trump: I know, I did my final speech in Michigan at 1:00 in the morning and we had 31,000 people, many people outside of the arena. And I felt-- when I left, I said, \"How are we gonna lose?\" We set it up a day before. And we had all of these people. And it was literally at 1:00 in the morning and I said, \"This doesn't look like second place.\" So we were really happy, I mean, it was-- these are great people.\nStahl: On election night, I heard you went completely silent. Was it a sort of realization of the enormity of this thing for you?\nPresident-elect Trump: I think so, it's enormous. I've done a lotta big things, I've never done anything like this. It is so big, it is so-- it's so enormous, it's so amazing.\nStahl: It kind of just took your breath away? Couldn't talk?\nPresident-elect Trump: A li-- a little bit, a little bit. And I think-- I realized that this is a whole different life for me now.\nStahl: Hillary called you. Tell us about that phone call.\nPresident-elect Trump: So Hillary called and it was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her, I mean, I can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. And for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn't have been nicer. She just said, \"Congratulations, Donald, well done.\" And I said, \"I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor.\" She is very strong and very smart.\nStahl: What about Bill Clinton? Did you talk to him?\nPresident-elect Trump: He did, he called the next day.\nStahl: Really? What did he say?\nPresident-elect Trump: He actually called last night.\nStahl: What did he say?\nPresident-elect Trump: And he-- he couldn't have been more gracious. He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he's ever seen.\nStahl: He said that.\nPresident-elect Trump: He was very, very -- really, very nice.\nStahl: It was a pretty nasty campaign. Do you regret any of the things you said about her?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, it was a double-side nasty.\nPresident-elect Trump: I mean they were tough and I was tough and-- do I regret? I mean, I'm sitting here with you now and we're gonna do a great job for the country. We're going to make America great again, I mean, that's what-- it-- it began with that and that's where we are right now. There are so many--\nStahl: So no-- no regrets about--\nPresident-elect Trump: I can't regret. No-- I wish it were softer, I wish it were nicer, I wish maybe even it was more on policy, or whatever you want to say. But-- but I will say that-- it really-- it really is something that I'm very proud of I mean it was a tremendous campaign.\nStahl: Can we talk about yesterday with President Obama?\nPresident-elect Trump: Sure.\nStahl: 90 minutes. You were scheduled for what? 15?\nPresident-elect Trump: 15 max.\nPresident-elect Trump: This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half. And it could have gone on for four hours. I mean it was-- just-- in fact, it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say. And he told me-- the good things and the bad things, there are things that are tough right now--\nStahl: Like what?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well…\nStahl: Give us some meat.\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, look I don't want to divulge, but we talked about the Middle East, that's tough. It's a tough situation. I wanted to get his full view and I got his, you know I got a good part of his view.\nStahl: Uh-huh.\nPresident-elect Trump: And I like having that because I'm going to be inheriting that in a short period of time. I found him to be terrific. I found him to be-- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects.\nPresident-elect Trump:–and we were talking about some victories, also, some things that-- that he feels very good about. But--\nStahl: Like--\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on was-- the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation.\nStahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it.\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, he didn't ask me, no, he told me-- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that.\nStahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or--\nPresident-elect Trump: No, I think I'm a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I'm not. I'm actually not. I'm a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. And-- and I really found—it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting.\nStahl: Was it at all awkward, at all, given what you've said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said you're-- unqualified--\nPresident-elect Trump: You know what, it was a very-- it was a very interesting thing because-- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like?\nStahl: Yeah.\nPresident-elect Trump: We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other—\nStahl: There was no awkwardness?\nPresident-elect Trump: I'll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that's strange. I'm actually surprised to tell you that. It's-- you know, a little bit strange.\nStahl: Do you think that-- that your election is a repudiation of his presidency?\nPresident-elect Trump: No, I think it's a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. They've let 'em down on the job front. They've even let 'em down in terms of the war front. You know, we've been fighting this war for 15 years--\nStahl: This was the message of your campaign.\nPresident-elect Trump: We've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what's been taking place over a longer period of time than that.\nStahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president?\nPresident-elect Trump: You know, I'll conduct myself-- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at-- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it's going to be America first. It's not going to be what we're doing—we, we've lost-- we're losing this country. We're losing this country. That's why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big.\nStahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don't want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be.\nStahl: Can you be?\nPresident-elect Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, that's easier. Honestly to do that, it's easier.\nStahl: So let's go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you're going to do what you said or you're going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall?\nPresident-elect Trump: Yes.\nStahl: They're talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?\nPresident-elect Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I'm very good at this, it's called construction.\nStahl: So part wall, part fence?\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah, it could be – it could be some fencing.\nStahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?\nPresident-elect Trump: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country, they're here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that you're talking about who are terrific people, they're terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley, it's very important, we want to secure our border.\nStahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the-- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We're going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes--\nStahl: And you've got both Houses?\nPresident-elect Trump: And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do things--\nStahl: You can do things lickety-split.\nPresident-elect Trump: It's been a long time since it's happened.\nPresident-elect Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Don't forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to-- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed.\nStahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money.\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah.\nStahl: You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team—\nPresident-elect Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests.\nStahl: And you want to get rid of all of that?\nPresident-elect Trump: I don't like it, no.\nStahl: You don't like it, but your own transition team, it's filled with lobbyists.\nPresident-elect Trump: That's the only people you have down there.\nStahl: You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby.\nPresident-elect Trump: Sure. Everybody's a lobbyist down there--\nStahl: Well, wait\nPresident-elect Trump: That's what they are. They're lobbyists or special interests—\nStahl: On your own transition team.\nPresident-elect Trump:–we are trying to clean up Washington. Look--\nStahl: How can you claim--\nPresident-elect Trump: Everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- that's the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we're going to clean it up. We're having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we're going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren't happy about, but we're putting on term limits. We're doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.\nStahl: But you're, but you're basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them?\nPresident-elect Trump: I'm saying that they know the system right now, but we're going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.\nStahl: Let's talk about your cabinet.\nPresident-elect Trump: OK.\nStahl: Have you made any decisions?\nPresident-elect Trump: Yes.\nStahl: Tell us.\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I can't tell you that, but I have made--\nStahl: Oh, come on—\nPresident-elect Trump: You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, I've spoken to many of them and I'll call the rest of them, but and I said, \"Boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is.\" France and U.K. and I mean everybody, all over Asia—and very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country.\nStahl: One of the things you're going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume you'll do that quickly?\nPresident-elect Trump: Yes. Very important.\nStahl: During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you appoint-- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade?\nPresident-elect Trump: So look, here's what's going to happen-- I'm going to-- I'm pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. They'll be very—\nStahl: But what about overturning this law--\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. They'll be pro-life, they'll be-- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody's talking about the Second Amendment and they're trying to dice it up and change it, they're going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and--\nStahl: Yeah, but then some women won't be able to get an abortion?\nPresident-elect Trump: No, it'll go back to the states.\nStahl: By state—no some --\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah.\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah, well, they'll perhaps have to go, they'll have to go to another state.\nStahl: And that's OK?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, we'll see what happens. It's got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.\nStahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you're taking on?\nPresident-elect Trump: No.\nStahl: Not at all?\nPresident-elect Trump: I respect it. But I'm not scared by it.\nStahl: Now you're not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric--\nPresident-elect Trump: That's only because they don't know me. I really believe that's only because--\nStahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that's--\nPresident-elect Trump: I just don't think they know me.\nStahl: Well, what do you think they're demonstrating against?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it-- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had--\nStahl: You think those people down there are—\nPresident-elect Trump: Well Lesley—\nStahl: are professional?\nPresident-elect Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah--\nStahl: OK, but what about – they're in every city.\nStahl: When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, don't you say to yourself, I guess you don't, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? They're afraid.\nPresident-elect Trump: I would tell them don't be afraid, absolutely.\nStahl: But that's not what you're saying, I said it-\nPresident-elect Trump: Oh, I think, no, no, I think-- I am saying it, I've been saying it.\nStahl: OK.\nPresident-elect Trump: Don't be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don't be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, \"Oh, that's a terrible thing.\" And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here.\n[Stahl raises the issue of ongoing protests]\nPresident-elect Trump: I am very surprised to hear that-- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that--\nStahl: But you do hear it?\nPresident-elect Trump: I don't hear it—I saw, I saw one or two instances…\nStahl: On social media?\nPresident-elect Trump: But I think it's a very small amount. Again, I think it's--\nStahl: Do you want to say anything to those people?\nPresident-elect Trump: I would say don't do it, that's terrible, 'cause I'm gonna bring this country together.\nStahl: They're harassing Latinos, Muslims--\nPresident-elect Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, \"Stop it.\" If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.\nStahl: I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators.\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah.\nStahl: You said that they were professionals—and you said it was unfair.\nPresident-elect Trump: I said some of them. Some of them are --\nStahl: But are you going to be tweeting and whatever you're upset about just put out there when you're president?\nPresident-elect Trump: So it's a modern form of communication, between Face-- you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million people--\nStahl: So you are going to keep it up?\nPresident-elect Trump: It's a great form of communication. Now, do I say I'll give it up entirely and throw out, that's a tremendous form-- I pick up-- I'm picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I'm not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, 'cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That's very tough--\nStahl: But you're going to do that as president?\nPresident-elect Trump: I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's-- it's where it's at. I-- I do believe this, I really believe that, um-- the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.\nStahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do, I'm going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we've been talking about.\nStahl: You-- you know, you--\nPresident-elect Trump: And get the country straightened away.\nStahl: You called her \"crooked Hillary,\" said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, \"Lock em' up.\"\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah. She did--\nStahl: Do you—\nPresident-elect Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things--\nStahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might…\nPresident-elect Trump: I don't want to hurt them. I don't want to hurt them. They're, they're good people. I don't want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.\nStahl: You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. You're about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A little--\nMrs. Trump: Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And it's-- a lot of work needs to be done. And-- it's-- your-- stuff on your shoulders. And-- we will take care of it-- day by day. I will stay true to myself. I'm very strong and um-- tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart.\nStahl: What kind of a first lady do you think she's going to be?\nPresident-elect Trump: She will be terrific. She is very strong and very confident, but she's very warm. And I think she'll have a platform where she'll really be able to do a lot of good. And that's what she wants to do.\nStahl: You know, first ladies usually have a cause. And you've already said you're interested in speaking out against bullying on social media.\nMrs. Trump: I think it's very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way.\nIt's an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign.\nStahl: What about your husband's tweeting?\nMrs. Trump: Well, sometimes he -- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following.\nStahl: So you never say to him, \"Come on\"?\nMrs. Trump: I did.\nPresident-elect Trump: She does--\nMrs. Trump: I--\nMrs. Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But…\nStahl: Does he listen to you?\nMrs. Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn't--\nPresident-elect Trump: I'm not a big tweeter. I mean, I don't do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across.\nStahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him?\nMrs. Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time.\nStahl: All the time?\nMrs. Trump: All the time.\nStahl: And does--\nMrs. Trump: And--\nStahl: --he listen? Does he--\nMrs. Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He's an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.\nStahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he's affected every bit as much. Maybe more.\nStahl: Maybe more.\nPresident-elect Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, \"I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job.\" And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed.\nStahl: Your son Barron, what is he, 10?\nMrs. Trump: 10.\nStahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know?\nMrs. Trump: He knows. He knows--\nStahl: He knows?\nMrs. Trump: --what's going on. And, he's very proud of his dad.\nStahl: Now-- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given--\nMrs. Trump: No.\nStahl: --what everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign?\nMrs. Trump: No. I didn't feel it.\nStahl: Not at all?\nMrs. Trump: No.\nStahl: Tell us about the meeting.\nMrs. Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice.\nStahl: You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. That's an enormous help. Your parents are here, right?\nMrs. Trump: They're here.\nStahl: Will they go to Washington with you?\nMrs. Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that.\nStahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair's out of place. Are you both prepared for this?\nMrs. Trump: We are used to it.\nPresident-elect Trump: I will say, it is on a different scale now, 'cause I've had a lot. But I've never had anything like this.\nStahl: You won't be able to walk down the street--\nMrs. Trump: I didn't do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It's another level, but it will continue.\nStahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation?\nPresident-elect Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don't-- I haven't made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think --\nStahl: Even though they leak so much?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, there's been a lotta leaking, there's no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I'd answer a question like that.\nStahl: Sounds like you're not sure.\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, sure, I'm not sure. I'd wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did.\nStahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns?\nPresident-elect Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I'm under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn't care because I won the election very easily. So they don't care. I never thought they did care.\nStahl: Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy.\nPresident-elect Trump: I do.\nStahl: So do you still think it's rigged?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I think the electoral ca-- look, I won with the Electoral College.\nStahl: Exactly.But do you think--\nPresident-elect Trump: You know, it's--\nStahl: --it's rigged?\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I hated--\nStahl: Even though you won you're saying that--\nPresident-elect Trump: I hated-- well, you know, I'm not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There's a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there's something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system.\nStahl: What about vacations? You're not going to take any vacations? You've said that.\nPresident-elect Trump: We have so much work. There's so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We're lowering taxes, we're taking care of health care. I mean, there's just so much to be done. So I don't think we'll be very big on vacations, no.\n5-Minute Fix newsletter\nKeeping up with politics is easy now.\nStahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the president's salary?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I've never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I'll take $1 a year. But it's a -- I don't even know what it is.\nPresident-elect Trump: Do you know what the salary is?\nStahl: $400,000 you're giving up.\nPresident-elect Trump: No, I'm not gonna take the salary.

[applause]\nSorry to keep you waiting; complicated business; complicated. [applause]\nThank you very much. [applause]\nI've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. [applause]\nShe congratulated us — it's about us — on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she — she fought very hard.\nHillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. [applause]\nI mean that very sincerely. [applause]\nNow it's time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. [applause]\nIt's time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. [applause]\nFor those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people...[laughter]...I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. [applause]\nAs I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their families. [applause]\nIt's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will. [applause]\nWorking together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. [applause]\nTremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well — tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. [applause]\nWe are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\nWe will also finally take care of our great veterans. [applause]\nThey've been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. [applause]\nWe have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be. [applause]\nWe'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.\nNothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.\nAmerica will no longer settle for anything less than the best. [applause]\nWe must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again.\nI want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.\nAnd now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory.\nFirst, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. [applause]\nGreat people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents.\nI also want to thank my sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And, where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert — my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? [applause]\nMy brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that's OK. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred. Great guy. Fantastic guy. [applause]\nFantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters; great, unbelievable parents.\nTo Melania and Don...[applause]...and Ivanka...[applause]...and Eric and Tiffany and Baron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. [applause]\nThis was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all.\nAnd Lara, unbelievable job, unbelievable.\nVanessa, thank you. Thank you very much.\nWhat a great group. You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people.\nAnd Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got — we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it's been — it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. [applause]\nUnbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings. That Rudy never changes. Where's Rudy? Where is he? Rudy.\nGovernor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. [applause]\nThank you, Chris.\nThe first man, first senator, first major, major politician, and let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get: Senator Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff? [applause]\nGreat man.\nAnother great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? [laughter]\nIs that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here.\nAnother great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats: Dr. Ben Carson. Where is Ben? [applause]\nWhere is Ben?\nAnd by the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family, Sarah — thank you very much.\nGeneral Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? [applause]\nAnd General Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign. And they're special people and it's really an honor. We have 22 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. We have just tremendous people.\nA very special person who believed me and, you know, I'd read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is...[crosstalk]\nThat's right. How did you possibly guess? So let me tell you about Reince, and I've said this. I said, Reince — and I know it, I know. Look at all those people over there. I know it. Reince is a superstar. But I said, \"They can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win,\" because you can't be called a superstar — like Secretariat — if Secretariat came in second, Secretariat would not have that big, beautiful bronze bust at the track at Belmont.\nBut I'll tell you, Reince is really a star. And he is the hardest-working guy. And in a certain way, I did this — Reince, come up here. Where is Reince? Get over here, Reince. [applause]\nBoy oh boy oh boy. It's about time you did this, Reince. My God. [applause]\nSay a few words. No, come on, say something.\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump. [applause]\nThank you. It's been an honor. God bless. Thank God.\nThe President-elect: We will do a great job. [applause]\nI look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, or maybe even eight years... [applause]...you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that — you will say that that was something that you really were very proud to do and I can...[crosstalk]\nThank you very much.\nAnd I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. [applause]\nWe're going to get to work immediately for the American people. And we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. You'll be so proud. Again, it's my honor. It was an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period. And I love this country. [applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause]\nThank you to Mike Pence.

It was an opportunity to say thank you. Whether we've seen eye to eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people—in living rooms and schools, at farms and on factory floors, at diners and on distant military outposts—all these conversations are what have kept me honest, kept me inspired, and kept me going. Every day, I learned from you. You made me a better President, and you made me a better man.\nOver the course of these 8 years, I've seen the goodness, the resilience, and the hope of the American people. I've seen neighbors looking out for each other as we rescued our economy from the worst crisis of our lifetimes. I've hugged cancer survivors who finally know the security of affordable health care. I've seen communities like Joplin rebuild from disaster and cities like Boston show the world that no terrorist will ever break the American spirit.\nI've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates and our newest military officers. I've mourned with grieving families searching for answers, and I found grace in a Charleston church. I've seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch and our wounded warriors walk again. I've seen our doctors and volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks. I've learned from students who are building robots and curing diseases and who will change the world in ways we can't even imagine. I've seen the youngest of children remind us of our obligations to care for our refugees, to work in peace, and above all, to look out for each other.\nThat's what's possible when we come together in the slow, hard, sometimes frustrating, but always vital work of self-government. But we can't take our democracy for granted. All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into the work of citizenship. Not just when there's an election, not just when our own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime. If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try to talk with one in real life. If something needs fixing, lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If you're disappointed by your elected officials, then grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself.\nOur success depends on our participation, regardless of which way the pendulum of power swings. It falls on each of us to be guardians of our democracy, to embrace the joyous task we've been given to continually try to improve this great Nation of ours. Because for all our outward differences, we all share the same proud title: citizen.\nIt has been the honor of my life to serve you as President. Eight years later, I am even more optimistic about our country's promise. And I look forward to working along your side, as a citizen, for all my days that remain.\nThanks, everybody.

Hello, Chicago! It's good to be home! Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. It's good to be home. Thanks. All right, everybody sit down. We're on live TV here. I've got to—I've got to move. You can tell that I'm a lame duck because nobody's following instructions. [Laughter] Everybody have a seat.\nMy fellow Americans, Michelle and I have been so touched by all the well wishes that we've received over the past few weeks. But tonight, tonight it's my turn to say thanks. Whether we have seen eye to eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American people, in living rooms and in schools, at farms, on factory floors, at diners and on distant military outposts—those conversations are what have kept me honest and kept me inspired and kept me going. And every day, I have learned from you. You made me a better President, and you made me a better man.\nSo I first came to Chicago when I was in my early twenties. And I was still trying to figure out who I was, still searching for a purpose in my life. And it was a neighborhood not far from here where I began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills. It was on these streets where I witnessed the power of faith and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and loss.\nAudience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\nThe President. I can't do that.\nAudience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\nThe President. Now, this is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved and they get engaged and they come together to demand it.\nAfter 8 years as your President, I still believe that. And it's not just my belief. It's the beating heart of our American idea, our bold experiment in self-government. It's the conviction that we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It's the insistence that these rights, while self-evident, have never been self-executing; that we, the people, through the instrument of our democracy, can form a more perfect Union.\nWhat a radical idea, a great gift that our Founders gave to us: The freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat and toil and imagination, and the imperative to strive together, as well, to achieve a common good, a greater good.\nFor 240 years, our Nation's call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new generation. It's what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny, pioneers to trek west, slaves to brave that makeshift railroad to freedom. It's what pulled immigrants and refugees across oceans and the Rio Grande. It's what pushed women to reach for the ballot. It's what powered workers to organize. It's why GIs gave their lives at Omaha Beach and Iwo Jima, Iraq and Afghanistan, and why men and women from Selma to Stonewall were prepared to give theirs as well.\nSo that's what we mean when we say America's exceptional: not that our Nation has been flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change and make life better for those who follow. Yes, our progress has been uneven. The work of democracy has always been hard. It's always been contentious. Sometimes it's been bloody. For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back. But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all and not just some.\nIf I had told you 8 years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history; if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9/11; if I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens—if I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high. But that's what we did. That's what you did.\nYou were the change. You answered people's hopes, and because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.\nIn 10 days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. No, no, no, no, no, the peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected President to the next. I committed to President-elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me. Because it's up to all of us to make sure our Government can help us meet the many challenges we still face.\nWe have what we need to do so. We have everything we need to meet those challenges. After all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most respected nation on Earth. Our youth, our drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours. But that potential will only be realized if our democracy works. Only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people. Only if all of us, regardless of party affiliation or particular interests, help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.\nThat's what I want to focus on tonight: the state of our democracy. Understand, democracy does not require uniformity. Our Founders argued. They quarreled. Eventually, they compromised. They expected us to do the same. But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity: the idea that for all our outward differences, we're all in this together; that we rise or fall as one.\nThere have been moments throughout our history that threatened that solidarity. The beginning of this century has been one of those times. A shrinking world, growing inequality; demographic change, and the specter of terrorism—these forces haven't just tested our security and our prosperity, but are testing our democracy as well. And how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids and create good jobs and protect our homeland. In other words, it will determine our future.\nTo begin with, our democracy won't work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity. And the good news is that today the economy is growing again. Wages, incomes, home values, and retirement accounts are all rising again. Poverty is falling again. The wealthy are paying a fairer share of taxes even as the stock market shatters records. The unemployment rate is near a 10-year low. The uninsured rate has never, ever been lower. Health care costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years. And I've said and I mean it: If anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we've made to our health care system that covers as many people at less cost, I will publicly support it.\nBecause that, after all, is why we serve. Not to score points or take credit, but to make people's lives better.\nBut for all the real progress that we've made, we know it's not enough. Our economy doesn't work as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a growing middle class and ladders for folks who want to get into the middle class. That's the economic argument. But stark inequality is also corrosive to our democratic ideal. While the top 1 percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income, too many of our families, in inner cities and in rural counties, have been left behind—the laid off factory worker, the waitress or health care worker who's just barely getting by and struggling to pay the bills—convinced that the game is fixed against them, that their Government only serves the interests of the powerful. That's a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics.\nBut there are no quick fixes to this long-term trend. I agree, our trade should be fair and not just free. But the next wave of economic dislocations won't come from overseas. It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good, middle class jobs obsolete.\nAnd so we're going to have to forge a new social compact to guarantee all our kids the education they need, to give workers the power to unionize for better wages, to update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now, and make more reforms to the Tax Code so corporations and individuals who reap the most from this new economy don't avoid their obligations to the country that's made their very success possible.\nWe can argue about how to best achieve these goals. But we can't be complacent about the goals themselves. For if we don't create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come.\nThere's a second threat to our democracy, and this one is as old as our Nation itself. After my election, there was talk of a postracial America. And such a vision, however well intended, was never realistic. Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society. Now, I've lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say. You can see it not just in statistics, you see it in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.\nBut we're not where we need to be. And all of us have more work to do. If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and an undeserving minority, then workers of all shades are going to be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves. If we're unwilling to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don't look like us, we will diminish the prospects of our own children, because those Brown kids will represent a larger and larger share of America's workforce. And we have shown that our economy doesn't have to be a zero-sum game. Last year, incomes rose for all races, all age groups, for men and for women.\nSo if we're going to be serious about race going forward, we need to uphold laws against discrimination: in hiring and in housing and in education and in the criminal justice system. That is what our Constitution and our highest ideals require. But laws alone won't be enough. Hearts must change. It won't change overnight. Social attitudes oftentimes take generations to change. But if our democracy is to work, the way it should, in this increasingly diverse Nation, then each one of us need to try to heed the advice of a great character in American fiction, Atticus Finch, who said, \"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\"\nFor Blacks and other minority groups, that means tying our own very real struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face, not only the refugee or the immigrant or the rural poor or the transgender American, but also the middle-aged White guy who, from the outside, may seem like he's got advantages, but has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change. We have to pay attention and listen.\nFor White Americans, it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didn't suddenly vanish in the sixties, that when minority groups voice discontent, they're not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness. When they wage peaceful protest, they're not demanding special treatment, but the equal treatment that our Founders promised.\nFor native-born Americans, it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants today were said, almost word for word, about the Irish and Italians and Poles, who it was said were going to destroy the fundamental character of America. And as it turned out, America wasn't weakened by the presence of these newcomers; these newcomers embraced this Nation's creed, and this Nation was strengthened.\nSo regardless of the station that we occupy, we all have to try harder. We all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do; that they value hard work and family just like we do; that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own.\nAnd that's not easy to do. For too many of us, it's become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods or on college campuses or places of worship or especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions. And the rise of naked partisanship and increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste—all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable. And increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.\nAnd this trend represents a third threat to our democracy. But politics is a battle of ideas. That's how our democracy was designed. In the course of a healthy debate, we prioritize different goals, and the different means of reaching them. But without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, then we're going to keep talking past each other, and we'll make common ground and compromise impossible.\nAnd isn't that part of what so often makes politics dispiriting? How can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, but not when we're cutting taxes for corporations? How do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party, but pounce when the other party does the same thing? It's not just dishonest, this selective sorting of the facts; it's self-defeating. Because, as my mom used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you. Take the challenge of climate change. In just 8 years, we've halved our dependence on foreign oil, we've doubled our renewable energy, we've led the world to an agreement that has the promise to save this planet. But without bolder action, our children won't have time to debate the existence of climate change. They'll be busy dealing with its effects: more environmental disasters, more economic disruptions, waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary.\nNow, we can and should argue about the best approach to solve the problem. But to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations, it betrays the essential spirit of this country, the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our Founders.\nIt is that spirit, born of the Enlightenment, that made us an economic powerhouse: the spirit that took flight at Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral, the spirit that cures disease and put a computer in every pocket.\nIt's that spirit, a faith in reason and enterprise and the primacy of right over might, that allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the Great Depression; that allowed us to build a post-World War II order with other democracies, an order based not just on military power or national affiliations, but built on principles: the rule of law, human rights, freedom of religion and speech and assembly, and an independent press.\nThat order is now being challenged, first by violent fanatics who claim to speak for Islam, more recently by autocrats in foreign capitals who see free markets and open democracies and civil society itself as a threat to their power. The peril each poses to our democracy is more far-reaching than a car bomb or a missile. They represent the fear of change; the fear of people who look or speak or pray differently; a contempt for the rule of law that holds leaders accountable; an intolerance of dissent and free thought; a belief that the sword or the gun or the bomb or the propaganda machine is the ultimate arbiter of what's true and what's right.\nBecause of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform, because of our intelligence officers and law enforcement and diplomats who support our troops, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past 8 years. And although Boston and Orlando and San Bernardino and Fort Hood remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be, our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant than ever. We have taken out tens of thousands of terrorists, including bin Laden. The global coalition we're leading against ISIL has taken out their leaders and taken away about half their territory. ISIL will be destroyed, and no one who threatens America will ever be safe.\nAnd to all who serve or have served, it has been the honor of my lifetime to be your Commander in Chief. And we all owe you a deep debt of gratitude.\nBut protecting our way of life, that's not just the job of our military. Democracy can buckle when it gives in to fear. So, just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are.\nAnd that's why, for the past 8 years, I've worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firmer legal footing. That's why we've ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, reformed our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties. That's why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans, who are just as patriotic as we are. [Applause]\nThat's why we cannot withdraw from big global fights: to expand democracy and human rights and women's rights and LGBT rights. No matter how imperfect our efforts, no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem, that's part of defending America. For the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression. If the scope of freedom and respect for the rule of law shrinks around the world, the likelihood of war within and between nations increases, and our own freedoms will eventually be threatened.\nSo let's be vigilant, but not afraid. ISIL will try to kill innocent people. But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our principles in the fight. Rivals like Russia or China cannot match our influence around the world, unless we give up what we stand for and turn ourselves into just another big country that bullies smaller neighbors.\nWhich brings me to my final point: Our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted. All of us, regardless of party, should be throwing ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions. When voting rates in America are some of the lowest among advanced democracies, we should be making it easier, not harder, to vote. When trust in our institutions is low, we should reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politics and insist on the principles of transparency and ethics in public service. When Congress is dysfunctional, we should draw our congressional districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes.\nBut remember, none of this happens on its own. All of this depends on our participation; on each of us accepting the responsibility of citizenship, regardless of which way the pendulum of power happens to be swinging.\nOur Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift, but it's really just a piece of parchment. It has no power on its own. We, the people, give it power. We, the people, give it meaning with our participation and with the choices that we make and the alliances that we forge. Whether or not we stand up for our freedoms, whether or not we respect and enforce the rule of law, that's up to us. America is no fragile thing, but the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.\nIn his own Farewell Address, George Washington wrote that self-government is the underpinning of our safety, prosperity, and liberty, but \"from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken . . . to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth.\" And so we have to preserve this truth with \"jealous anxiety;\" that we should reject \"the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties\" that make us one.\nAmerica, we weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character aren't even willing to enter into public service; so coarse with rancor that Americans with whom we disagree are seen not just as misguided, but as malevolent. We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others, when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt, and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them.\nIt falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy; to embrace the joyous task we've been given to continually try to improve this great Nation of ours. Because for all our outward differences, we, in fact, all share the same proud title, the most important office in a democracy: citizen. Citizen.\nSo, you see, that's what our democracy demands. It needs you. Not just when there's an election, not just when your own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime. If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life. If something needs fixing, then lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself. Show up. Dive in. Stay at it.\nSometimes you'll win. Sometimes you'll lose. Presuming a reservoir of goodness in other people, that can be a risk, and there will be times when the process will disappoint you. But for those of us fortunate enough to have been a part of this work and to see it up close, let me tell you, it can energize and inspire. And more often than not, your faith in America, and in Americans, will be confirmed.\nMine sure has been. Over the course of these 8 years, I've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates and our newest military officers. I have mourned with grieving families searching for answers, and found grace in a Charleston church. I've seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch. I've seen wounded warriors who at points were given up for dead walk again. I've seen our doctors and volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks. I've seen the youngest of children remind us through their actions and through their generosity of our obligations to care for refugees or work for peace and, above all, to look out for each other.\nSo that faith that I placed all those years ago, not far from here, in the power of ordinary Americans to bring about change—that faith has been rewarded in ways I could not have possibly imagined. And I hope your faith has, too. Some of you here tonight or watching at home, you were there with us in 2004, in 2008, 2012; maybe you still can't believe we pulled this whole thing off. Let me tell you, you're not the only ones. [Laughter]\nMichelle—Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, girl of the South Side, for the past 25 years, you have not only been my wife and mother of my children, you have been my best friend. You took on a role you didn't ask for and you made it your own, with grace and with grit and with style and good humor. You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody. And a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model. So you have made me proud. And you have made the country proud.\nMalia and Sasha, under the strangest of circumstances, you have become two amazing young women. You are smart, and you are beautiful, but more importantly, you are kind, and you are thoughtful, and you are full of passion. And you wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily. Of all that I've done in my life, I am most proud to be your dad.\nTo Joe Biden, the scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delaware's favorite son, you were the first decision I made as a nominee, and it was the best. Not just because you have been a great Vice President, but because in the bargain, I gained a brother. And we love you and Jill like family, and your friendship has been one of the great joys of our lives.\nTo my remarkable staff: For 8 years—and for some of you, a whole lot more—I have drawn from your energy, and every day I tried to reflect back what you displayed: heart and character and idealism. I've watched you grow up, get married, have kids, start incredible new journeys of your own. Even when times got tough and frustrating, you never let Washington get the better of you. You guarded against cynicism. And the only thing that makes me prouder than all the good that we've done is the thought of all the amazing things that you are going to achieve from here.\nAnd to all of you out there—every organizer who moved to an unfamiliar town, every kind family who welcomed them in, every volunteer who knocked on doors, every young person who cast a ballot for the first time, every American who lived and breathed the hard work of change—you are the best supporters and organizers anybody could ever hope for, and I will be forever grateful. Because you did change the world. You did.\nAnd that's why I leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than when we started. Because I know our work has not only helped so many Americans, it has inspired so many Americans, especially so many young people out there, to believe that you can make a difference, to hitch your wagon to something bigger than yourselves.\nLet me tell you, this generation coming up—unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic—I've seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair and just and inclusive America. You know that constant change has been America's hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace. You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You'll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands.\nMy fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President, the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me 8 years ago. I'm asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change, but in yours.\nI am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the Moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can.\nYes, we did. Yes, we can.\nThank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-01-10", "title": "Farewell Address to the Nation From Chicago, Illinois"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This Office of the Press Secretary released online versions of the exit memorandums submitted to the President by each Cabinet member. In his remarks, the President referred to Supreme Court Associate Justices Sonia M. Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ruth Bader Ginsberg; and President-elect Donald J. Trump. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121422", "text": "To my fellow Americans,\nEight years ago, America faced a moment of peril unlike any we'd seen in decades.\nA spiraling financial crisis threatened to plunge an economy in recession into a deep depression. The very heartbeat of American manufacturing—the American auto industry—was on the brink of collapse. In some communities, nearly one in five Americans were out of work. Nearly 180,000 American troops were serving in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the mastermind of the worst terror attack on American soil remained at large. And on challenges from health care to climate change, we'd been kicking the can down the road for way too long.\nBut in the depths of that winter, on January 20, 2009, I stood before you and swore a sacred oath. I told you that day that the challenges we faced would not be met easily or in a short span of time—but they would be met. And after eight busy years, we've met them—because of you.\nEight years later, an economy that was shrinking at more than eight percent is now growing at more than three percent. Businesses that were bleeding jobs unleashed the longest streak of job creation on record. The auto industry has roared its way back, saving one million jobs across the country and fueling a manufacturing sector that, after a decade of decline, has added new jobs for the first time since the 1990s. And wages have grown faster over the past few years than at any time in the past forty.\nToday, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, another 20 million American adults know the financial security and peace of mind that comes with health insurance. Another three million children have gained health insurance. For the first time ever, more than ninety percent of Americans are insured—the highest rate ever. We've seen the slowest growth in the price of health care in fifty years, along with improvements in patient safety that have prevented an estimated 87,000 deaths. Every American with insurance is covered by the strongest set of consumer protections in history—a true Patients' Bill of Rights—and free from the fear that illness or accident will derail your dreams, because America is now a place where discrimination against preexisting conditions is a relic of the past. And the new health insurance marketplace means that if you lose your job, change your job, or start that new business, you'll finally be able to purchase quality, affordable care and the security and peace of mind that comes with it—and that's one reason why entrepreneurship is growing for the second straight year.\nOur dependence on foreign oil has been cut by more than half, and our production of renewable energy has more than doubled. In many places across the country, clean energy from the wind is now cheaper than dirtier sources of energy, and solar now employs more Americans than coal mining in jobs that pay better than average and can't be outsourced. We also enacted the most sweeping reforms since the Great Depression to protect consumers and prevent a crisis on Wall Street from punishing Main Street ever again. These actions didn't stifle growth, as critics predicted. Instead, the stock market has nearly tripled. Since I signed Obamacare into law, America's businesses have added more than 15 million new jobs. And the economy is undoubtedly more durable than it was in the days when we relied on oil from unstable nations and banks took risky bets with your money.\nThe high school graduation rate is now 83 percent—the highest on record—and we've helped more young people graduate from college than ever before. At the same time, we've worked to offer more options for Americans who decide not to pursue college, from expanding apprenticeships, to launching high-tech manufacturing institutes, to revamping the job training system and creating programs like TechHire to help people train for higher-paying jobs in months, not years. We've connected more schools across the country to broadband internet, and supported more teachers to bring coding, hands-on making, and computational thinking into our classrooms to prepare all our children for a 21st century economy.\nAdd it all up, and last year, the poverty rate fell at the fastest rate in almost fifty years while the median household income grew at the fastest rate on record. And we've done it all while cutting our deficits by nearly two-thirds even as we protected investments that grow the middle class.\nMeanwhile, over the past eight years, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland. Plots have been disrupted. Terrorists like Osama bin Laden have been taken off the battlefield. We've drawn down from nearly 180,000 troops in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan to just 15,000. With a coalition of more than 70 nations and a relentless campaign of more than 16,000 airstrikes so far, we are breaking the back of ISIL and taking away its safe havens, and we've accomplished this at a cost of $10 billion over two years—the same amount that we spent in one month at the height of the Iraq War.\nAt the same time, America has led the world to meet a set of global challenges. Through diplomacy, we shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program, opened up a new chapter with the people of Cuba, and brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that could save this planet for our kids. With new models for development, American assistance is helping people around the world feed themselves, care for their sick, and power communities across Africa. And almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago. All of this progress is due to the service of millions of Americans in intelligence, law enforcement, homeland security, diplomacy, and the brave men and women of our Armed Forces—the most diverse institution in America.\nWe've also worked to make the changing face of America more fair and more just—including by making strides towards criminal justice reform, making progress towards equal pay, repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell, and advancing the cause of civil rights, women's rights, and LGBT rights. I appointed two extraordinary women to the Supreme Court, marking the first time in history that three women sit on the bench, including the first Latina. And today in America, marriage equality is finally a reality across all fifty states.\nThis is where America stands after eight years of progress. By so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started—a situation I'm proud to leave for my successor. And it's thanks to you—to the hard work you've put in; the sacrifices you've made for your families and communities; the way you've looked out for one another.\nStill, through every victory and every setback, I've insisted that change is never easy, and never quick; that we wouldn't meet all of our challenges in one term, or one presidency, or even in one lifetime. And for all that we've achieved, there's still so much I wish we'd been able to do, from enacting gun safety measures to protect more of our kids and our cops from mass shootings like Newtown, to passing commonsense immigration reform that encourages the best and brightest from around the world to study, stay, and create jobs in America.\nAnd for all the incredible progress our economy has made in just eight years, we still have more work to do for every American still in need of a good job or a raise, paid leave or a dignified retirement. We have to acknowledge the inequality that has come from an increasingly globalized economy while committing ourselves to making it work better for everyone, not just those at the top, and give everyone who works hard a fair shot at success.\nAnd here's the thing—over the past eight years, we've shown that we can. Last year, income gains were actually larger for households at the bottom and the middle than for those at the top. We've also made the tax code fairer. The tax changes enacted over the past eight years have ensured that the top one percent of Americans pay more of their fair share, increasing the share of income received by all other families by more than the tax changes in any previous administration since at least 1960. Simply put, we've actually begun the long task of reversing inequality. But as the global economy changes, we'll have to do more to accelerate these trends, from strengthening unions that speak for workers, to preventing colleges from pricing out hardworking students, to making sure that minimum wage workers get a raise and women finally get paid the same as men for doing the same job. What won't help is taking health care away from 30 million Americans, most of them white and working class; denying overtime pay to workers, most of whom have more than earned it; or privatizing Medicare and Social Security and letting Wall Street regulate itself again—none of which middle-class Americans voted for.\nWe will have to move forward as we always have—together. As a people who believe that out of many, we are one; that we are bound not by any one race or religion, but rather an adherence to a common creed; that all of us are created equal in the eyes of God. And I'm confident we will. Because the change we've brought about these past eight years was never about me. It was about you. It is you, the American people, who have made the progress of the last eight years possible. It is you who will make our future progress possible. That, after all, is the story of America—a story of progress. However halting, however incomplete, however harshly challenged at each point on our journey—the story of America is a story of progress.\nRecently, I asked each member of my talented and dedicated Cabinet to prepare a detailed report on the progress we've made across the board these past eight years, and the work that remains to make this country we love even stronger. Today, I'm sharing them with you. And I hope you'll share them with others, and do your part to build on the progress we've made across the board.\nIt has been the privilege of my life to serve as your President. And as I prepare to pass the baton and do my part as a private citizen, I'm proud to say that we have laid a new foundation for America. A new future is ours to write. And I'm as confident as ever that it will be led by the United States of America—and that our best days are still ahead.\nSincerely,\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2017-01-04", "title": "Letter to the Nation on Cabinet Member Exit Memorandums"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119640", "text": "The peaceful transfer of power is a bedrock principle of our democracy. The President was grateful for the time and care put into the 2008 transition by President Bush's Administration. That is why he directed his team last year to make a smooth transition between administrations a top priority of his final year in office even as he remained committed to using every remaining day of his presidency to deliver on his agenda for the American people.\nStarting in early 2016, Administration officials began to map out the transition planning, including three key components: preparing for the incoming administration, ensuring this Administration's records are appropriately archived, and facilitating the off-boarding of current Administration personnel. To coordinate the planning across government, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough convened the President's Cabinet in March to give an overview of the transition process and set the expectation that the transition should be a top priority for every federal agency.\nThe President also established the White House Transition Coordinating Council (WHTCC) and the Agency Transition Directors Council (ATDC), which have met regularly throughout the year. The transition has also been a standing agenda item for the monthly President's Management Council (PMC) meeting, comprised of Deputy Secretaries of major agencies. To coordinate government-wide activities, the Administration also established a regular meeting of agencies with special transition responsibilities, including the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Government Ethics (OGE), National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). These agencies play a unique government-wide role during a presidential transition, such as DOJ which processes security clearances for the incoming teams or OGE which reviews the ethics requirements for nominees.\nAfter the nominating conventions, each candidate's transition team began working out of GSA-provided space and began attending WHTCC and ATDC meetings and engaging regularly with Administration officials on their planning efforts. For example, the Administration and both candidates' transition teams developed common expectations for engaging with agencies so agencies knew what to expect right after the election. This collaboration helped agencies better plan for and focus their efforts on what the transition teams would most likely need. Throughout this period, the Administration assisted both candidates' transition teams in a non-partisan manner, providing equitable services and information to each.\nPost-Election Transition Period\nAs with past presidential transitions, following the Election, the Federal government has begun to engage with the President-Elect's Transition Team (PTT). This week, Agency Review Teams selected by the President-Elect, will begin to reach out to their designated counterparts at agencies across the government. The President-Elect's Agency Review Teams will receive detailed, agency-specific briefings that have been prepared by current Administration officials. Those briefings include organizational charts, budget materials, briefings on key agency priorities and areas of responsibility, and other materials describing the essential functions of that agency. In addition to the initial briefings, designated employees across the Administration will work closely with their Agency Review Teams in order to facilitate open communication between the outgoing and incoming Administrations. Simultaneously, the President-Elect's Transition Team will establish policy teams that will work out of GSA-provided office space in Washington, D.C.\nThe Administration is also taking steps to ensure the next President and his or her team is prepared from day one to protect our national security. As part of a longstanding tradition, building off the intelligence briefings the two candidates received before the election, the President-Elect and other senior officials will begin receiving daily intelligence briefings from the intelligence community. In addition, the Administration is hosting two interagency exercises to inform and familiarize the incoming administration on domestic incident management practices used by the current administration. These exercises are designed to provide a high-level perspective on a series of challenges that the next administration may confront and to introduce the key authorities, policies, capabilities, and structures that are currently in place to respond to major domestic incidents.\nThe Administration will also continue its work in the two other areas of focus: archiving records and off-boarding current Administration personnel. Thus far, the Administration has transferred roughly 283 million files to NARA, comprising 122,000 GB of data. In addition to the transfer of electronic records, NARA has also begun to facilitate the move of the President's physical records to Chicago, Illinois, where they will ultimately be preserved at President Obama's library. This move includes the transfer of textual, electronic, and audiovisual records, and tens of thousands of presidential gifts.\nAnd, the Administration is committed to providing out-going appointees the information they need to plan for their own transitions.  In support of the well-respected principle that the incoming President selects her or his own team, the President has asked appointees to submit resignation letters effective no later than the inauguration of the new President. In conjunction with this off-boarding process, Administration officials have been working with agency personnel offices to provide additional personnel and benefits information to appointees prior to the end of the Administration.\nModernizing the Transition\nIn undertaking the transition, the Administration has sought to streamline, formalize, and modernize the transition. Key improvements to the transition process that the Administration has implemented include:\nBeginning Formal Transition Planning Earlier: Recognizing the significant challenge posed by a Presidential transition, the Obama Administration began the formal transition planning process at the beginning of this year. In May, the President signed an Executive Order appointing the first Federal Transition Coordinator to centralize transition planning across the agencies. The President also established the two transition councils, the WHTCC and ATDC – marking the earliest the Federal government has ever begun formal interagency preparations for the Presidential transition. To ensure agencies are prepared for the drastic personnel change that comes with transition, the Administration also began to prepare senior career officials who may serve in acting political positions for their new role earlier in the transition process.\nIn addition, recognizing the unprecedented volume of electronic data from this administration that needs to be preserved, Administration officials began monthly planning meetings with NARA in 2012 and commenced the first test?runs of data transfers in April 2015. The Executive of the President (EOP) then began to transfer presidential records to NARA's Electronic Records Archive in May 2016– the earliest that the EOP has ever begun transferring substantial quantities of electronic records to NARA in preparation for a transition.\nStreamlined Transition Materials: In conjunction with the ATDC, the Administration hosted conversations on best practices for assembling transition materials for the next Administration. Drawing upon the expertise of individuals with previous transition experience, these conversations resulted in tailored and more concise briefing materials that more readily addressed the needs of the incoming teams. In addition, in some cases, agencies used modern technology including collaboration websites, tablets and apps to deliver that material. For example, the DHS pre-loaded materials onto tablets in a searchable format.\nIn addition, the White House has worked to better document the broader transition planning effort in order to hand the next Administration a step-by-step guide of how to manage a government-wide transition. This effort includes documenting the Agency Review Team process, collating guidance documents, establishing key milestones, and other metrics.\nDeveloped Architecture for A ‘Digital Transition': Recognizing the unique and unprecedented challenge of archiving and preserving the Administration's digital infrastructure, the Administration set out several months ago to develop a plan that would: 1) ensure the proper archiving of all digital records, consistent with the Presidential Records Act; 2) where possible, allow real time access to the content the Administration created on the platforms in which the content originated; and 3) ensure that the next president and administration could continue to use and build upon the digital assets this Administration created to connect directly with the people they serve. As a result, the Administration developed and released a first-of-its-kind  digital transition plan that meets these key goals.\nDeveloped New On-Boarding Systems: One of the biggest challenges facing the incoming Administration is filling over 4,000 political appointee positions as quickly as possible. To better streamline this process, GSA working in conjunction with the Presidential Personnel Office (PPO) and White House IT collaborated with the candidates' transition teams to design and develop an online human resources application for the collection, categorization, assignment, and processing of applications for positions in the new Administration. This approach combined the IT expertise of GSA and White House IT with the real-world experience of PPO who manages the appointee process from application through appointment. This new system can serve as a single tool for processing a candidate from application through appointment, rather than the multiple systems used at the beginning of the current Administration. In addition, PPO provided data on executive branch agencies, offices, and positions with which to populate the system, avoiding the need to duplicate the lengthy and labor-intensive data collection and entry conducted for the current system utilized by PPO. After the Inauguration, this new tool can be utilized by the incoming President to replace the legacy system currently used by PPO, allowing the incoming Administration to use the same tool and processes before and after the Inauguration. It can also be more easily tailored to the specific policies and processes the new Administration decides to adopt.\nIn addition, the OGE has developed a new e-filing system, Integrity, which allows nominees for Presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed (PAS) positions to enter their financial disclosure information online through a secure website and for ethics officials to review the forms and communicate back with the nominees via the automated system. In September 2016, OGE held orientation sessions on Integrity for each campaign's transition team and has been working with each team so they are prepared to use the system to enter information of potential PAS nominees starting the day after the election and throughout the Presidential transition.\nEngaged Agencies Not Traditionally Included In the Formal Transition Planning Process: In addition to the formal transition councils that the President established, the Administration, for the first time, has also held formal transition planning meetings with smaller agencies, boards and commissions across the government who are not otherwise represented on the two councils. This group, including more than 200 entities, has been engaged fully in the transition process from the beginning and has met regularly over the past several months. The Administration undertook this whole-of-government approach to transition planning in order to help these smaller agencies, board and commissions prepare for the upcoming transition by developing briefing materials for the incoming teams, ensuring continuity of operations as they off-board appointees, and have in place the necessary infrastructure to support incoming appointees.", "timestamp": "2016-11-10", "title": "Fact Sheet: Facilitating a Smooth Transition to the Next Administration"}

Good afternoon, everybody. Yesterday, before votes were tallied, I shot a video that some of you may have seen in which I said to the American people: Regardless of which side you were on in the election, regardless of whether your candidate won or lost, the Sun would come up in the morning.\nAnd that is one bit of prognosticating that actually came true. The Sun is up. And I know everybody had a long night. I did as well. I had a chance to talk to President-elect Trump last night—about 3:30 in the morning, I think it was—to congratulate him on winning the election. And I had a chance to invite him to come to the White House tomorrow to talk about making sure that there is a successful transition between our Presidencies.\nNow, it is no secret that the President-elect and I have some pretty significant differences. But remember, 8 years ago, President Bush and I had some pretty significant differences. But President Bush's team could not have been more professional or more gracious in making sure we had a smooth transition so that we could hit the ground running. And one thing you realize quickly in this job is that the Presidency—and the Vice Presidency—is bigger than any of us.\nSo I have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set 8 years ago and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the President-elect, because we are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country. The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world.\nI also had a chance last night to speak with Secretary Clinton, and I just had a chance to hear her remarks. I could not be prouder of her. She has lived an extraordinary life of public service. She was a great First Lady. She was an outstanding Senator for the State of New York. And she could not have been a better Secretary of State. I'm proud of her. A lot of Americans look up to her. Her candidacy and nomination was historic and sends a message to our daughters all across the country that they can achieve at the highest levels of politics. And I am absolutely confident that she and President Clinton will continue to do great work for people here in the United States and all around the world.\nNow, everybody is sad when their side loses an election. But the day after, we have to remember that we're actually all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmage. We're not Democrats first. We're not Republicans first. We are Americans first. We're patriots first. We all want what's best for this country. That's what I heard in Mr. Trump's remarks last night. That's what I heard when I spoke to him directly. And I was heartened by that. That's what the country needs: a sense of unity; a sense of inclusion; a respect for our institutions, our way of life, rule of law; and a respect for each other. I hope that he maintains that spirit throughout this transition, and I certainly hope that's how his Presidency has a chance to begin.\nI also told my team today to keep their heads up, because the remarkable work that they have done day in, day out—often without a lot of fanfare, often with a lot of attention—work in agencies, work in obscure areas of policy that make Government run better and make it more responsive and make it more efficient and make it more service friendly so that it's actually helping more people, that remarkable work has left the next President with a stronger, better country than the one that existed 8 years ago.\nSo win or lose in this election, that was always our mission. That was our mission from day one. And everyone on my team should be extraordinarily proud of everything that they have done, and so should all the Americans that I've had a chance to meet all across this country who do the hard work of building on that progress every single day: teachers in schools; doctors in ER clinic; small businesses putting their all into starting something up, making sure they're treating their employees well; all the important work that's done by moms and dads and families and congregations in every State—the work of perfecting this Union.\nSo this was a long and hard-fought campaign. A lot of our fellow Americans are exultant today. A lot of Americans are less so. But that's the nature of campaigns. That's the nature of democracy. It is hard and sometimes contentious and noisy, and it's not always inspiring.\nBut to the young people who got into politics for the first time and may be disappointed by the results, I just want you to know, you have to stay encouraged. Don't get cynical. Don't ever think you can't make a difference. As Secretary Clinton said this morning, fighting for what is right is worth it.\nSometimes, you lose an argument. Sometimes, you lose an election. The path that this country has taken has never been a straight line. We zig and zag, and sometimes, we move in ways that some people think is forward and others think is moving back. And that's okay. I've lost elections before. Joe hasn't. [Laughter] But you know—[laughter].\n[At this point, Vice President Joe Biden made the sign of the cross.]\nThe President. So I've been sort of——\nVice President Biden. Remember, you beat me badly. [Laughter]\nThe President. That's the way politics works sometimes. We try really hard to persuade people that we're right. And then, people vote. And then, if we lose, we learn from our mistakes, we do some reflection, we lick our wounds, we brush ourselves off, we get back in the arena. We go at it. We try even harder the next time.\nThe point, though, is, is that we all go forward, with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens, because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy. That's how this country has moved forward for 240 years. It's how we've pushed boundaries and promoted freedom around the world. That's how we've expanded the rights of our founding to reach all of our citizens. It's how we have come this far.\nAnd that's why I'm confident that this incredible journey that we're on as Americans will go on. And I am looking forward to doing everything that I can to make sure that the next President is successful in that. I have said before, I think of this job as being a relay runner. You take the baton, you run your best race, and hopefully, by the time you hand it off, you're a little further ahead; you've made a little progress. And I can say that we've done that, and I want to make sure that handoff is well executed, because ultimately, we're all on the same team.\nAll right?
