And we continued our meetings (inaudible) actually, your visit shortly after coming to office. He is attesting to the large desire by President Trump and your administration to strengthen the strategic cooperation with Georgia. For this, please accept my hearty gratitude.\nThis year notes the 25th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties. And in this regard, the U.S. role in strengthening our democratic development, sovereignty, and the track leading towards membership of NATO -- your role was the key one. And by your assistance, Georgia is right now neither Soviet nor post-Soviet-type of a country. Right now we are the European democracy associated with EU.\nWe stand proud alongside with American side on the watch of the global stability, and we're contributing into the peace worldwide. Georgian people highly prize the friendship of the American people standing by and invariable support.\nMr. Vice President, we have conversed even on the deeper insight in terms of our cooperation. I would like to single out and salute our work in the defense field.\nYour upcoming meeting with the Georgian and U.S. servicemen partaking in Noble Partner exercise is strongly attesting to the U.S. support in terms of solidifying Georgian sovereignty, Georgian security, and Georgia's aspiration to NATO.\nWe have agreed on the joint plan of action that will further contribute in strengthening of the Georgian defense capability. It's very important for stability within our region.\nThe U.S. has contributed financially immensely to assist Georgia in the course of 25 years, and we are -- extremely (inaudible) that we're becoming more and more attractive for U.S. visitors. We have one of the best visits environment, with a low level of corruption and bureaucracy; and with low taxes, as well, which is the best opportunity for the benefits of the United States' visited.\nWe are aiming to prepare (inaudible) for U.S. visits in the region.

(Inaudible) of this agreement, it will manage the port terminal and also make investment in this project, which is the overarching one for Georgia.\nThe (inaudible) project is one more time manifesting the readiness of American businesses to get involved in this project and turning Georgia into regional hub. We have implemented the scores of (inaudible) energy projects in Georgia on the grounds of cooperation with the U.S. side, which is assuring the sustainability of European energy safety.\nAnd we are going to continue this cooperation. We are the partners who stand ready for the high level of economic trade and investment relations, which will be resting on the mutual benefits.\nGeorgia is a very important partner to the United States in the region. And also we are sharing one and the same values like democracy and human rights.\nAmerica has played a significant role in construction of our democratic institutions. And our development is a precursor for us; as we'll be in the position to develop the sustainable and strong state that will assure the protection of rights of every citizen and retaining cultural identity.\nThe support of the U.S. is the overarching in the peaceful resolution of Georgia-Russian conflict. We are highly prizing this invariable end -- staunch position by the U.S. toward Georgian territorial integrity.\nIt was unprecedented on the part of President Trump, personally, you, and the Congress, the resolution made on the Georgian occupied territories.\nWe have deliberated on the immense challenges facing our country at the outcome of the occupation. You have had the huge role to play in the Geneva talks, and it is very important at a high-level engagement to seek now concrete solutions of the occupation of Georgian territory, ensuring safety as well as the solution in terms of politically resolve this conflict and allow me unequivocally mention in the end of my speech that Georgia will be standing by the United States when we will dealing with the most important challenges to our friends on a world scale. Our partnership is oriented at the strengthening of Georgian, as well as the global security in terms of assisting peaceful and democratic development.\nAllow me one more time to emphasize the immense importance of the visit and the results which were procured. We highly appreciate the fact that -- the fact that -- existing challenges (inaudible) Georgia, the Vice President within the framework of first bilateral European tour visited Georgia.\nA lot of thanks to our American counterparts (inaudible) Georgia and their contribution in deepening our mutual relationship -- special contribution, and I am assured that by joint effort, we'll further deepen our strategic cooperation.\nAt the same time, we are extremely gratified to introduce Georgian culture to the Vice President, his spouse, and our American guests.\nThank you very much for your attention.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Prime Minister Kvrikashvili, thank you so much for those words and for the hospitality you have shown me and my family. It was an honor to welcome you to the White House just a few short months ago, and now it's my honor to be welcomed by you to the beautiful and storied nation of Georgia.\nThe President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump sent me here with a simple message for you and for the people of Georgia: We are with you. We stand with you. We are proud of our friendship and strategic partnership with the nation and the people of Georgia.\nIn word, I'm here to say America First does not mean America alone. And America stands with Georgia.\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of the United States' diplomatic relationship with Georgia, yet this is a nation whose roots stretch back into the mists of history.\nSitting at the crossroads of empires and civilizations -- where East meets West, where North meets South -- Georgia has fostered your own traditions, your own language, and your own identity over the millennia.\nToday the people of Georgia are renowned the world over for your vibrant culture, which my wife and I enjoyed last night, at our first Supra dinner, featuring Georgian cuisine and a lot of it, and traditional song and dance from Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and all across Georgia.\nWe've also been deeply inspired by the rich heritage of faith, and my wife and I look forward to visiting the historic Sioni Cathedral and meeting the Patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church this afternoon.\nAnd while this may be my first visit to this nation, the enduring courage and spirit of the Georgian people have long inspired me.\nIt was only a generation ago that Georgia was still imprisoned inside the then-Soviet Union. When that brutal regime collapsed, you reclaimed your independence and your freedom. You reached out your hand in friendship to Europe and the United States of America -- and we were proud to reach back.\nToday, I commended the Prime Minister for Georgia's democratic development, which has brought Georgia closer to unity with Europe and membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Further progress on the goals that the Prime Minister has set will bring Georgia even closer and NATO even closer to your grasp, and it will strengthen the bond between our nations.\nNowhere is the bond between our two nations stronger than in our shared effort to promote security and stability across the wider world. Georgia is a key strategic partner of the United States of America.\nSince 2004, thousands of Georgians have served shoulder-to-shoulder with Americans -- in Kosovo, in Iraq, and in Afghanistan.\nIn Afghanistan alone, I say with a grateful heart, Georgia has provided more troops on a per-capita basis than any other country in the world. And 31 brave Georgian soldiers have given their lives for the cause of freedom. The American people remember and mourn the sacrifice of your countrymen. They are heroes, all. And they and their families will be enshrined in the hearts of the American people forever.\nLater today, I will meet with troops participating in Exercise Noble Partner. This initiative has brought together the armed forces of the United States, Georgia, and many other nations to train together and strengthen Georgia's ability to defend itself, and it's only one of many examples of the United States' commitment to Georgia's security.\nPresident Trump and I stand by the 2008 NATO Bucharest statement, which made it clear that Georgia will one day become a member of NATO.\nAs I expressed to the Prime Minister, it is heartening to see that Georgia already exceeds NATO's goal of spending 2 percent of its gross domestic product on its national defense. But as we all know, Georgia's investment in defense is an investment borne of necessity.\nAt this very moment, just 40 miles from where we stand, Russian tanks stand on occupied territory in South Ossetia. Today, Russia continues to occupy one-fifth of Georgian territory.\nSo to be clear: The United States of America strongly condemns Russia's occupation on Georgia's soil.\nThe United States supports Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. And under President Donald Trump, the United States of America will reject any claim, at any time, by any nation that undermines this enduring principle.\nPresident Trump has called on Russia to \"cease its destabilizing activities\" -- and my purpose here today is to reinforce that message to the people of Georgia.\nIn a sign of our commitment, very soon, President Trump will sign legislation to strengthen and codify the United States' sanctions against Russia.\nAs always, our country prefers a constructive relationship with Russia based on cooperation and common interests. But the President and our Congress are unified in our message to Russia: A better relationship, the lifting of sanctions will require Russia to reverse the actions that caused sanctions to be imposed in the first place.\nWe hope for better days, and we hope for better relations with Russia, but the recent diplomatic action taken by Moscow I can assure will not deter the commitment of the United States to our security, to that of our allies, and to freedom-loving nations around the world like Georgia.\nThe United States will continue to work with Georgia to reduce your vulnerabilities and counter Russian aggression. And so, too, will we work with Georgia to deepen our ties of commerce of which the Prime Minister just spoke.\nThe United States has a keen interest in expanding our trade and investment relationship with Georgia, and your ongoing reforms, Mr. Prime Minister, have clearly demonstrated your openness and commitment to a stronger commercial partnership with the West.\nToday, I thanked the Prime Minister for his leadership and focus on bringing greater economic opportunity to all of Georgia's citizens.\nThe Anaklia deep-sea port shows the potential of a stronger bilateral relationship between our nations. American companies are investing alongside their Georgian counterparts in this multi-billion-dollar project. As we look toward the future, our two nations have untold opportunities to contribute even more to each other's prosperity.\nThe United States has stood with Georgia for a quarter century, and under President Donald Trump, we will continue to stand with you -- as partners, as friends, and one day, we will stand together as allies.\nGeorgia's future is in the West. And as the people of Georgia have long declared, our strength is now and always will be in our unity.\nSo thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. Thank you for your hospitality here today. And thank you for the strong leadership that you've provided for this country. We look forward to working with you for the prosperity and the security of the people of Georgia and of our great nation.\nQ: (As interpreted.) Mr. Vice President, while visiting the Baltic countries, you mentioned that U.S. always stands to guard the safety of the world, that the Americans will always support Georgia's safety. And when we see that the -- on a daily basis, the rights of the people living on the occupied territories are being breached -- what steps may be taken by the Georgian side, alongside with the (inaudible)?\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, as I said, the United States of America stands strongly for the territorial integrity of Georgia, and we've stood on that principle since the time that Russian tanks overtook Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008. And we'll continue to stand strong.\nThe joint military operations that are taking place today we hope are a visible sign of our commitment to Georgia's sovereignty and to her internationally recognized borders.\nWe also believe that in addition to security partnership, that a stronger and more prosperous Georgia will lead to a restoration of a whole and free Georgia. And so the United States will continue to look for ways that we can strengthen Georgia not only from the standpoint of its defense and security, but where we can strengthen Georgia economically, creating jobs and opportunity and prosperity, and strengthening the hand of Georgia so that one day, Georgia can once again celebrate its historic territorial integrity intact.\nPRIME MINISTER KVRIKASHVILI: (In progress, as interpreted.) -- so much for your question, and I would like to render my thanks to the Vice President for his clear-cut (inaudible) message, invariable support, which actually we -- which with Georgia (inaudible) our strategic partner in the United States. As it has been noted, our territorial integrity (inaudible) acute problem which requires consistent approach on one part to attain in Georgia stability, economic development, and democratic evolvement, as well as (inaudible) in-depth cooperation to achieve the advances in the field of safety.\nBut the territorial integrity may be resurrected by the peaceful steps, economic development, and by the staunch support of our strategic partners -- first and foremost, the United States.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, in light of Russia's retaliation against sanctions, as well as Russia sending 100,000 troops to the eastern end of NATO's territories to drill, do you truly believe the better relationship that you and President Trump want with Russia is possible? And if things continue in this direction, could we be headed for another Cold War?\nAnd then, Mr. Prime Minister, you know better than anyone how real the threat of Russia aggression is. The Vice President just said the United States supports Georgia's aspirations into NATO. So what concrete assurances do you have that the U.S. will defend you should Russia attack, as President Putin has threatened?\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you for the question. President Trump sent me on this journey to send a very clear message to the Baltic States, to the people of Georgia, and before the end of the day in Montenegro that the United States of America will stand with freedom-loving nations around the world; and that we will do so, as the President has said, not merely with words but with actions.\nThe presence of American forces in Poland, the presence of the British forces, with whom I met in Estonia at a gathering yesterday, all give material evidence of the commitment of NATO in that region to live up to our Article 5 obligation.\nThe current Russian exercises, which news reports today suggest will move up to 100,000 Russian troops into Belarus, is simply a confirmation of the importance of clarity within the NATO partnership.\nPresident Trump and I believe that better relations with Russia may be possible. But as the President has said, we'll see.\nBut negotiations between parties always begin with a recognition and a respect for the position of each party. And with the sanctions that President Trump will sign this week, codifying sanctions that have been in place by the United States, our country is sending a very clear message and calling on our European allies to join us in a very clear message that we mean what we say and say what we mean; that Russia's destabilizing activities in Ukraine, their support for rogue regimes like Iran and Syria and North Korea, that their posture has to change.\nBut we believe that by being clear and being strong, that we can pursue a dialogue based on mutual understanding. And President Trump holds the view that it's been a lack of clarity and commitment by the United States that's created much of the instability in the world today.\nWhen in the past America had spoken of red lines and not followed through on red lines, many argue that that emboldened others to act in ways that they would not have.\nAnd so President Trump believes that we can have peace through strength. And strong and clear positions, we believe, can create a foundation where authentic dialogue may -- we hope -- result in better relations and in the resolution of long-standing disputes in Ukraine, in Georgia, and in other areas of the world.\nPRIME MINISTER KVRIKASHVILI: Thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you for the question.\nI think the very clear and strong message \"we are with you\" tells everything. Georgia faces endless provocations daily. On the occupation line, we are facing challenges of borderization, capturing, kidnapping of ethnic Georgians -- violating basic human rights of ethnic Georgians residing on the occupied territories. But the response to that is only even more resolve and consistency and dedication to the goals we set for ourselves.\nIntegration into NATO is that process which matters for Georgia. Of course, the final goal to join NATO is set by Georgian population, and we are following this very difficult path of reforming Georgia's military system and developing institutional democracy in Georgia.\nAnd believe me, through the consistency and through the dedication, clearness of our messages and unity with our important strategic partners, it will be able for Georgia to reach this very important goal to ensure long-term stability. And it is possible. We Georgians believe that.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, what are the red lines -- Washington's red lines on Russia, especially in regard to Georgia? And also you said in Estonia that in case of Russia's aggressions against NATO allies, members of the alliance, the United States will intervene. What would be your reaction in case of Russia's aggression against Georgia -- against NATO's partners?\nThank you very much.\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, do we have enough patience to wait for NATO membership where we are waiting -- Georgia is waiting for a while? Thank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you for the question.\nThe essence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a mutual-defense agreement, that an attack on one is an attack on all. And what the President wanted me to communicate as I travel to our NATO countries, as later today I'll visit the newest members of NATO, is that the United States says what it means and means what it says. And we'll live up to our obligations under Article 5.\nWith regard to Georgia, we strongly support Georgia's aspiration to become a member of NATO. And we'll continue to work closely with this Prime Minister and the government of Georgia broadly to advance the policies that will facilitate becoming a NATO member. We believe that Georgia has made extraordinary progress -- not just in the past 25 years, but over the last five years, there has been significant progress in Georgia that we believe will strengthen the application for NATO membership.\nWith regard to the Russian aggression, which took place in 2008, which has as we stand here today Russian tanks parked on Georgian soil 40 miles from where we stand, the United States will continue to be unambiguous in our commitment to the territorial integrity of Georgia.\nWe will stand for a strong and whole Georgia. We will continue to provide support for the defense and security of Georgia, and we will continue to seek a peaceful resolution that will reestablish the internationally recognized borders of this nation.\nPRIME MINISTER KVRIKASHVILI: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Thank you for question. You said it's about patience. Yet it's about strategic patience I would say. To stay consistent on the road where we are, today we have all practical tools to advance towards NATO membership. We have substantial package. We are implementing it very successfully. We have Georgia Defense\nReadiness program, jointly with the United States, which is complementary to the substantial package.\nAnd it was said many times by the leaders of our strategic partners -- the United States first, of course, and NATO leadership that no other country has a say to block the membership of Georgia to NATO. It's only NATO members and applicant countries who decide about the future in NATO. And we have made our own decision.\nThank you.\nQ: Thank you. Mr. Vice President, you've talked about the new Russia sanctions bill as an example of U.S. resolve in the face of Russia aggression. But did not the Trump White House oppose this bill, fearing that it relinquishes presidential authority to Congress? What happened in this process that caused the White House to sign on?\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia tried to interfere in our presidential election. Living so close to Russia, having dealt with Russian provocations, do you have any advice for the United States in how to cope with Russian efforts to intervene in our elections and influence voters in our country?\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you, Peter. Thank you for the question.\nPresident Trump will sign the Russia sanctions bill soon. Our administration had concerns about this legislation when it emerged from the United States Senate. The concern was that it did not include the traditional flexibility that is afforded to the State Department or any administration in the conduct of American foreign policy.\nI'm pleased to report that the bill improved significantly as it moved through the House of Representatives and through the legislative process. This legislation we believe will not only codify current Russian sanctions that our administration has upheld, but will also strengthen those sanctions -- even while giving the President of the United States and our State Department the ability and the flexibility to be able to administer American foreign policy as appropriate.\nAnd let me say that in signing the sanction, our President and our Congress are speaking with a unified voice that those matters that the President spoke about so eloquently in Warsaw, about Russian destabilizing activities, about Russia's efforts to support rogue regimes -- that has to change.\nFor there to be a change in our relationship with Russia, Russia has to change its behavior. And by these sanctions, by my presence here, by the President's powerful affirmation of the objectives and the values of our alliance in the West, our hope is that we will move toward better relations and a better future and a more peaceful world as a result.\nPRIME MINISTER KVRIKASHVILI: Thank you. First of all, let me once again mention how important is strong America for Georgia. We are genuinely interested in the strength of the United States, and we would like to see the United States united to cope with the global challenges.\nI don't think that Georgia is in a position to judge about Russian interference. With our excellent intelligence capabilities, we were not able to detect any interference, and we think that American nation has made its decision to elect a President. And of course, we look for more partnership with the current administration of the United States.\nThank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you all.", "timestamp": "2017-08-01", "title": "The Vice President's News Conference with Prime Minister Giorgi Kvrikashvilli of Georgia in Tbilisi, Georgia"}

(Applause.)\nAnd to all of you, I bring greetings from the leader of the free world, the President of the United States of America -- President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThe President sent me here to this place, at this time simply to thank all -- thank you for stepping up to serve your nations, for standing in the gap on this great frontier -- united in the defense of freedom.\nYou are the best of us -- heroes all.\nAnd you are here, the Americans among you so far away from home, because the United States and Georgia are bound together by the abiding oath of friendship and by our shared commitment to the cause of freedom.\nUnder President Trump, the policy of the United States is to place the security and the prosperity of America first. But as the President has made clear, and as our presence here today demonstrates, America First does not mean America alone.\nWe are here today, with the steadfast assurance of the United States of America to tell our friends in Georgia: We are with you. (Applause.)\nWe stand with the nation and the people of Georgia, and we will stand with you as you pursue membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. And the United States of America stands with Georgia in defense of what President Trump in Warsaw called \"the priceless ties that bind us together as nations, as allies, and as a civilization.\" And those ties are freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.\nThe roots of the nation and people of Georgia stretch back into the mists of history. Sitting here at the crossroads of empires and civilizations -- where East meets West, where North meets South -- Georgia has fostered a vibrant culture and a rich heritage of faith.\nAnd through all the millennia, none have been able to deprive you of your identity. The people and culture of Georgia have stood the test of time. (Applause.)\nIt was only a generation ago that Georgia was still imprisoned inside the Soviet Union. That Communist regime personified everything that free peoples reject, and it sought to crush you in its heartless, inhuman embrace. The Soviet Union sought to eradicate your history -- even the very essence of who you are, the cherished ties of culture and faith.\nBut when the Soviet Union collapsed, Georgia reclaimed its liberty. You reached out your hand in friendship to the free nations of Europe and the United States, and the United States of America proudly reached back. (Applause.)\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between the United States and Georgia, and we marvel at your progress -- the progress you've made since you regained your independence. Georgia's future is in the West.\nFor many years, Georgia has been a key strategic partner of the United States. Since 2004, thousands of brave Georgians have served with their American brothers-and-sisters-in-arms in Kosovo, in Iraq, and in Afghanistan.\nIn Afghanistan alone, Georgia has provided more troops on a per-capita basis than any other country in the world. (Applause.)\nAnd today we remember 31 Georgian soldiers who've given their lives in the cause of freedom in that land. The American people remember their sacrifice and their families on this day. They are heroes. And let me assure you and their families that they will be enshrined in the hearts of the American people forever.\nThe strategic partnership between the United States and Georgia is stronger now than ever before, and this joint exercise is a tangible sign of our commitment to each other to make it stronger still.\nExercise Noble Partner brings together the Armed Forces of the United States, of Georgia, and many other nations to train together and execute complex operations.\nNoble Partner will strengthen Georgia's ability to defend itself in the years ahead. It will prepare Georgian soldiers to join NATO's Response Force in the future.\nThis exercise is a testament to your professionalism, to the high value that the United States and our NATO allies place on Georgia's security. But our commitment to your security doesn't stop there.\nAmerican advisors will continue to work alongside your leaders to improve Georgia's military readiness. And along with all our NATO allies, the United States is contributing to the Substantial Package for Georgia, to strengthen Georgia's resilience, and to bring Georgia ever closer to your goal of membership in NATO. (Applause.)\nAnd to be clear, President Trump and the United States stand firmly behind the 2008 NATO Bucharest statement, which made it clear that Georgia will someday become a member of the most successful military alliance in the history of the world. (Applause.)\nGeorgia has already taken important steps toward this goal -- especially in terms of security. Georgia has long exceeded NATO's own goal of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. Your commitment is a model for many current NATO members, many of which have not fulfilled their obligations to our common defense. And so I want to congratulate and thank Georgia for your strong commitment and your strong example of national leadership on national defense. (Applause.)\nAnd to those here in the uniform of the United States, be assured your Commander-in-Chief is busy making the strongest fighting force in the history of the world stronger still.\nAs President Trump said just a few days ago, in his words, \"American might is second to none -- and we're getting bigger, and better, and stronger every day.\"\nThe President has already signed the largest increase in military spending in nearly 10 years. And we're calling on Congress to pass one of the largest investments in defense since the days of the Cold War.\nOur investments in our defense, like Georgia's, are borne of necessity. The rise of adversaries new and old requires renewed strength and renewed resolve by all who cherish freedom.\nWe stand here today in the gap, on a frontline of freedom, a frontline compromised by Russian aggression nearly a decade ago. At this very moment, just 40 miles from where we stand, Russian tanks sit on Georgian land in South Ossetia. Today, Russia continues to occupy one-fifth of Georgian territory.\nThe United States strongly condemns Russia's occupation of Georgia's soil. (Applause.)\nBe assured: The United States will continue to support Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.\nThe United States of America, under President Donald Trump, will reject any claim, at any time, by any nation that undermines this enduring principle.\nTo that end, President Trump has called on Russia recently, here and elsewhere, to \"cease its destabilizing activities,\" and we will continue to work with Georgia to reduce your vulnerabilities and counter potential Russian aggression.\nAnd in a further sign of our commitment, very soon, President Trump will sign legislation to strengthen and codify the United States' sanctions against Russia.\nThe United States prefers a constructive relationship with Russia based on mutual cooperation and common interests. But the President and our Congress are unified in our message to Russia -- a better relationship, the lifting of sanctions will require Russia to reverse the actions that caused the sanctions to be imposed in the first place. And not before. (Applause.)\nWe hope for better days, for better relations with Russia, but the recent diplomatic action taken by Moscow I can assure you will not deter this President or the commitment of the United States to our security, that of our allies, and freedom-loving nations around the world like the freedom-loving people of Georgia.\nThe United States has stood with Georgia since your independence, and under President Trump, we will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder and work hand-in-hand with you to fortify your defense, to strengthen your democracy, and to deepen your ties of friendship with Europe and the United States.\nWe stand with you because we know the wisdom of that ancient Georgian saying there is -- \"strength is in unity.\" (Applause.)\nSo in unity, together, we will be strong in arms. In unity, together, we will be strong in resolve. And in unity, together, we will be strong in faith -- faith in freedom, and faith in Him from whom our freedom springs.\nEarlier today, my wife and I visited the Patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church at the Sioni Cathedral; that soaring temple, whose foundations stretch back more than 1,500 years, is deeply inspiring. It's a symbol of the ancient faith that fills this land.\nAs I walked beneath its painted dome, I could not help but think of an ancient truth from the sacred scriptures, one which we'd do well to reflect on in these challenging times. As we train, as we prepare, as we promote commerce and mutual prosperity, we do well to remember those words: \"Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"\nToday, we recommit ourselves to the cause of security, prosperity, and liberty for the people of Georgia. We renew our pledge to stand together in unity as partners and as friends, and to one day stand together as allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. (Applause.)\nAnd we do so with confidence and with faith -- faith in the courage of all of you who wear the uniform, faith and confidence in the strength and resilience of the proud people of this ancient land, confident in the leadership of our Commander-in-Chief, President Donald Trump, and your leadership in Georgia, and with faith in the blessings and protection of God above, I know the United States and Georgia will embrace a future of freedom in unity together.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless Georgia. And God bless the United States of America.

That's 58 million individuals whose families count on small businesses to keep food on the table, send their children to college, or save for the future.\nAnd that's why we have an entire agency led by an incredibly successful businesswoman, dedicated specifically to promoting small businesses. During the last administration, small business found themselves under assault from a federal government that seemed determined to keep piling on regulations and compliance requirements until it became impossible to keep their doors open.\nObamacare's mandate saddled many with healthcare costs they simply couldn't afford, and every year these business owners see new additions to the tax code that force them to spend additional time and money to file. The President is committed to ending these anti-growth policies and unleashing the American economy. We will continue to work with Congress to repeal Obamacare's oppressive mandates. And along with our partners in Congress, we will deliver bold tax reform that provides relief for middle-income individuals, a more competitive model for businesses, and a simplification for everyone.\nAnd we will continue the President's ambitious plans to eliminate unnecessary regulations which disproportionately affect small businesses. We look forward to hearing from the small businesses this afternoon about how the Trump administration can continue to be an advocate for them.\nAnd with that, we'll keep it short today, and I'll take your questions now.\nAlex.\nQ: I wanted to ask about a comment Senator Lindsay Graham made this morning. He said it was wrong that there's no good military option regarding North Korea. He said there's a military option to destroy North Korea's program and North Korea itself. Would the White House be supportive of that option?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: Would the White House be supportive of that option to destroy North Korea's program and North Korea itself?\n(Phone interruption.)\nMS. SANDERS: Is somebody lost? Are those directions? Sorry, I just keep hearing somebody's phone talking or something. Yeah, it's very distracting.\nQ: Lindsay Graham said that the only military option against North Korea is to destroy North Korea's program and North Korea itself.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the President obviously has been very outspoken about how he feels about North Korea. We're weighing all options, keeping all options on the table. And as we've said many times before, we're not going to broadcast what we're going to do until that happens.\nQ: (Inaudible) option?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: So destroying the country like Lindsay Graham says is an option?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is the President has been very outspoken about the need to stop North Korea. We've been very focused on stopping the nuclear program, stopping the missiles, stopping the aggression. That still continues to be the focus, and we're keeping those -- all options on the table in order to do that.\nQ: Sarah, according to the Washington Post, the President tried to change the narrative of what went down in Don Jr.'s meeting with the Russian lawyer. Can you address that story and tell us, did the President really try to do that?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the statement that Don Jr. issued is true. There's no inaccuracy in the statement. The President weighed in as any father would, based on the limited information that he had. This is all discussion, frankly, of no consequence. There was no follow-up. It was disclosed to the proper parties, which is how the New York Times found out about it to begin with.\nThe Democrats want to continue to use this as a PR stunt and are doing everything they can to keep this story alive and in the papers every single day. The President, the American people -- they voted America first, not Russia first, and that's the focus of our administration.\nJohn.\nQ: Can you clarify the degree to which the President weighed in?\nMS. SANDERS: He certainly didn't dictate, but he -- like I said, he weighed in, offered suggestion like any father would do.\nQ: Did he not know what the intelligence was --\nMS. SANDERS: Steven.\nQ: I want to follow up on that. Was he aware at the time that Don Jr. had had a meeting that was based on the pretext that he would be promised information that was negative about Hillary Clinton when he suggested that the statement only say that the meeting was primarily about Russian adoption policy?\nMS. SANDERS: Like I said, the statement that was issued was true, and there were no inaccuracies in the statement.\nI think what the bigger question is -- everybody wants to try and make this some story about \"misleading.\" The only thing I see misleading is a year's worth of stories that have been fueling a false narrative about this Russia collusion, and a phony scandal based on anonymous sources.\nAnd I think that is -- if we're going to talk about misleading, that's that only thing misleading I see in this entire process. You guys are focused on a meeting that Don Jr. had no consequence when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine. The Democrat-linked firm, Fusion GPS, actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that's been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news. And if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons. As we've said time and time again --\nQ: But you won, Sarah.\nMS. SANDERS: -- Bill Clinton was paid half-a-million dollars to give a speech to a Russian bank and was personally thanked by Putin for it. Hillary Clinton allowed one-fifth of America's uranium reserve to be sold to a Russian firm whose investors were Clinton Foundation donors, and the Clinton campaign chairman's brother lobbied against sanctions on Russia's largest bank and failed to report it. If you guys want to talk about having relations, which you seem obsessed with doing, look no further than there.\nIf you want to talk about somebody who has actually been tough on Russia, look at President Trump. He wants more fracking, more coal, more energy, a stronger military, a stronger defense. Those things aren't good for Russia. I think the distinctions are very clear, and you guys want to create a narrative that just doesn't exist.\nQ: Sarah --\nQ: Sarah --\nMS. SANDERS: Hey, guys --\nQ: Why hasn't the President signed the Russia bill?\nMS. SANDERS: Glenn, go ahead.\nQ: Sarah, sort of a follow-up on what you were talking about -- our obsession with Russia and the responsibility laying with the Clintons. There's a report out today, based on a lawsuit that was filed, that says that Sean Spicer met with a campaign donor and a journalist from Fox News where they were pushing around this story that Seth Rich, this low-ranking DNC staffer that was murdered, was perhaps the one responsible for the WikiLeaks breach.\nTwo questions. Sean put out a statement; he said it was just a brief meeting. He said the guy didn't know the President. The lawsuit alleges that the President knew about it and had an influence on the story. Did the President know about the story, pre-publication, and did he have an influence on the way the story was written?\nMS. SANDERS: The President had no knowledge of the story, and it's completely untrue that here at -- the White House involvement in the story. And beyond that, this is ongoing litigation, and I'd refer you to the actual parties involved, which aren't the White House.\nQ: To follow up, does it disturb you that the Press Secretary, for the President of the United States -- you just gave this incredibly passionate pushback on us for focusing on Russia. Does it disturb you -- you just sped right past this -- does it disturb you that there's an allegation out there and a lawsuit, and Sean Spicer admitted meeting with these two individuals, that this was discussed in your White House? That this particular --\nMS. SANDERS: He met with members of the media. I don't find that to be a strange thing.\nQ: He met with a member of the media that was pushing --\nMS. SANDERS: You guys are all members of the media.\nQ: He was pushing a story that was later retracted because it was false. He met with that reporter and he met with a campaign donor. Does it disturb you? Does it say anything about this White House, if you entertain that kind of story?\nMS. SANDERS: It doesn't bother me that the Press Secretary would take a meeting with somebody involved in the media about a story. None of that was disclosed. They had a conversation and that was the end of it. You guys come to us with stories all day. I've taken meetings with the majority of the people in this room. I don't always know the nature of the story of which you're coming to talk to me about. But it's my job to talk to you, to listen. And I'm responding. The President didn't have knowledge of this story. The White House didn't have any involvement in the story. And beyond that, it's ongoing litigation that doesn't involve anybody in the building, and so I'd refer you to the parties that it does.\nQ: Sarah, I have two questions for you, because I want to follow up on something you said yesterday, after my first question. You were on that flight back from the G20. Did you advise the President to be truthful in that statement that he was helping --\nMS. SANDERS: I wasn't part of the conversation regarding the statement.\nQ: You were not in the room at the time, or in the area at the time?\nMS. SANDERS: I was in the air. I was on the plane, but I wasn't part of the conversation, so I can't speak to anything beyond that part.\nQ: Yesterday, you said that the President was joking about his comments, putting suspects' heads -- telling police officers they shouldn't cover their heads in putting them in the car. Was he making a joke about police brutality?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at all. I think you guys are jumping and trying to make something out of nothing. He was simply making a comment, making a joke. And it was nothing more than that.\nQ: Sarah, what's so funny?\nQ: What's funny about that, Sarah?\nQ: Should he apologize for that joke?\nQ: On that same issue, the head of the DEA wrote immediately after the President made those remarks -- to officers of the DEA -- telling them to disregard them, and saying he had an obligation to speak up when something wrong happened.\nMS. SANDERS: It wasn't a directive. It was a joke. There's a very big difference.\nQ: So why was that not clear --\nMS. SANDERS: Olivier.\nQ: Has the President signed the Russia, North Korea, and Iran sanctions bill?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, has he signed it?\nQ: Yes.\nMS. SANDERS: He has not. But as we put out a statement earlier this week, he will. And we'll let you know when the details and final plan --\nQ: What's the delay? What's the delay here? You guys have had this since Friday. What's holding him back?\nMS. SANDERS: There's nothing holding him back. There's a review process, a legal process. They're going through that, and he'll sign the bill and we'll let you guys know.\nMargaret.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. I had two questions. The first is, there's a really interesting story out, just before the briefing began, by Defense One, talking about Air Force One, and it says that the U.S. Air Force has found an alternative to get the price down, as President Trump wanted, and that was to buy a pair of Boeing 747 jetliners that were abandoned by a bankrupt Russian airline. Can you verify the accuracy of the story? Do you know if that's correct?\nMS. SANDERS: I can't at this time. That's something I'd have to check into and get back to you.\nQ: Okay. And then I also wanted just sort of an update on the new Chief of Staff, General Kelly. Can you talk to us sort of, in broad strokes, about the calls and outreach that he's made so far to leadership in Congress, folks outside of Congress, any governors, that sort of thing? Can you talk to us broadly about the message that he's sending and the people that he's talking to both inside and outside of the administration?\nMS. SANDERS: I know he's spoken to a number of members of Congress as well as a large number of individuals within the staff. He's taking time to get to know everyone here in the building that he hasn't met previously through his other role. And working through setting up new processes and kind of setting the tone, I think, for a White House that, under his leadership, will be very focused on the President's agenda, as we've been doing the last six months. We're going to continue on that track and we're going to do that under General Kelly, and we're very excited to work alongside him in that process.\nHallie.\nQ: Sarah, on the President's agenda -- and I'm just sitting here and I heard you list off a list of reasons of why you think that the media should be focusing on Democrats and not the President. And not to belabor an obvious point, but Hillary Clinton is certainly not in the Oval Office; Donald Trump is. And there seems to be a trust deficit that is being created with some on Capitol Hill.\nAnd I want to tell you what Lindsay Graham said this morning on \"The Today Show.\" He says, \"If this is true\" -- this Washington Post reporting -- \"it was a bad decision by the President, which will make us ask more questions. When you get caught in a lie about one thing, that makes it hard to say we'll just let the other stuff go.\" Is this what is hurting the President's legislative agenda, this credibility issue on the Hill?\nMS. SANDERS: I think what's hurting the legislative agenda is Congress's inability to get things passed.\nQ: Can you elaborate on that a little bit, Sarah? Because clearly there is a concern from some Republicans that the President is not always being as truthful as he could be. How does he plan to address that?\nMS. SANDERS: I think by being truthful and transparent as he has every single day.\nGo ahead.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I'd like to return to North Korea. With North Korea continuing to escalate nuclear tensions, can we expect any actions from the administration to ratchet up pressure of actions on China?\nMS. SANDERS: As we've said, we're not going to broadcast movements on things like that before they take place. But we're going to continue to work with our allies, continue to work with our partners. And again, the goals are to stop the nuclear program, stop the missiles, stop the aggression with North Korea. We're going to continue looking at the best options and ways to accomplish that.\nQ: Can you say what some of those options might be?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at this time.\nJohn. Sorry, John Gizzi, you had your hand up when I first went back --\nQ: Thank you, Sarah.\nMS. SANDERS: I'm happy to go to somebody else named John.\nQ: You said yesterday that -- I think you said yesterday that there would be no reshuffle in the Cabinet, meaning General Sessions would not move over to the Homeland Security. Is that correct?\nMS. SANDERS: Correct.\nQ: And does that also mean that Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the vice-chairman of the President's Commission on Electoral Integrity, would stay in his position and not be considered for Homeland Security?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of any movements for him. But as always, when we have a personnel announcement, I'd be happy to share it with you.\nJon Decker. Since we're in the Johns --\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I was hoping just to follow up on North Korea. I was hoping you could clarify the administration's message that it has for North Korea. The other day, the President said, when asked about North Korea, \"We will take care of them. We will take care of everything.\" And a little bit ago, the Secretary of State, Secretary of State Tillerson, said that the U.S. is trying to convince North Korea that the U.S. is not your enemy. So which one is it? Is the President focused on North Korea as an adversary, or is Secretary Tillerson correct that the U.S. is trying to send this message that the U.S. is not North Korea's enemy?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, like I just said a few minutes ago, the big priorities here, which we've laid out -- I think this is the third or fourth time I've done it just today -- is to stop the nuclear program, stop the missiles, stop the aggression. That's what we're focused on in regards to North Korea, and we're going to continue pushing on that, and continue working with our allies and partners to accomplish that and do what is necessary to achieve it.\nQ: Are they an adversary? Does the President --\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think in some ways they get to decide by the actions that they take. If they want to stop their nuclear program, stop the game, stop the missiles, stop the aggression, then I think we may be able to find ways to move forward. But those are the priorities of this administration.\nDave.\nQ: Sarah, thanks. Secretary Mnuchin had a meeting on the Hill this morning with Senate leaders about the debt ceiling. Apparently, according to reports, they didn't get anywhere. Obviously this has the potential to affect the stock market rally that the President is so pleased with.\nMS. SANDERS: I think the whole country is pleased with it.\nQ: Yes, that's true. Do you have any reason to believe at this point that you're going to get the debt ceiling issue done by the end of September?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, to ensure that we have robust economic growth and promote fiscal discipline, the Trump administration believes it's important to raise the debt ceiling as soon as possible. Over the past two decades, members of Congress and Presidents from both parties have raised the debt ceiling 15 times, and we look forward to working with Congress to ensure that full faith and credit of the United States government.\nQ: Sarah.\nMS. SANDERS: April.\nQ: Thank you.\nMS. SANDERS: Since you said my name so politely. (Laughter.)\nQ: Thank you, Sarah.\nMS. SANDERS: Somewhat sarcastic.\nQ: Me being sarcastic? No, never.\nMS. SANDERS: Go ahead, April.\nQ: All right. Sarah, when it comes to this joke that the President said on Friday, you have many organizations -- you have police organizations, the NAACP, and the American citizens share they're upset about this. Could there be an apology from the President? And what does he view as reasonable when he's not joking, when it comes to use of force from police?\nMS. SANDERS: I would have to ask on that specific question.\nQ: But do you think that the President is remorseful for what he said because of the outcry from Friday?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President supports our law enforcement and he supports the protection of the citizens of this country, and he wants to empower our law enforcement to be able to do their job. I don't think there's anything beyond that.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. First, following up on Olivier's question, he mentioned that there's a legal review of this legislation, but the White House has already said that the President will sign it. So what is the nature of that review, if presumably there was some review before putting out that statement?\nMS. SANDERS: As with any very particularly complex piece of legislation like this is, there's a legal review. And once we sign that, we'll work through and put more of the details of that process out.\nQ: And separately, one more for you. Last month, the President delivered a warning to Congress a couple of times not to take vacation in August. What is the status of the President's August plans? Does he plan to leave Washington? For how long? And what will he be doing during that timeframe?\nMS. SANDERS: We'll continue to keep you guys updated on his August schedule as those details are finalized.\nAndrew.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. The Coast Guard Commandant says that he won't turn his back on transgender troops, which would seem to preclude adherence to the President's directive on Twitter. Does the White House consider that he's refusing to follow an order?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't heard those comments or had a chance to speak with any about it, but I know that the goal is to work with all of the relevant departments, primarily the Department of Defense, to lawfully implement that new policy.\nQ: Sarah, you just told April that you would have to ask the President if an apology would be appropriate. Are you saying you will ask him and get back to us?\nMS. SANDERS: No, I said I would have to in order to answer that question.\nQ: Well, could you please?\nQ: Would you?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll let you know if I do.\nQ: Also, on General Kelly -- you said yesterday that everybody is now reporting to the President through him. Is that an accurate characterization?\nMS. SANDERS: Right, like I said that General Kelly has full authority in the White House.\nQ: So does that mean nobody can wander in to the White House on their own? Is he going to post somebody outside the Oval Office?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think anybody can wander into the White House on their own without Secret Service stepping in.\nQ: Excuse me -- into the Oval Office. Can his daughter? Can his son-in-law? Can Steven Bannon wander into the Oval Office without --\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think anybody just wanders into the Oval Office. Look, this is the White House. He's the President of the United States of America, and there are processes --\nQ: But it's pretty informal here normally, right? I mean, people talk to him. They don't wait to get approval to talk to him.\nMS. SANDERS: Look, General Kelly is going to work with the entire team as he's been doing over the last couple days. He's done a great job of sitting down and talking to individuals about the needs that they have, the conversations, and putting a structure in place. There's nothing abnormal about that.\nQ: Can top staff talk to the President without the approval of General Kelly?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't know that I would say \"approval\" is the correct word, but I certainly don't think it's like we're getting permission slips signed. But I do think that there is something to having a structured process in order -- just to make things run more smoothly at the White House.\nQ: What's the President's reaction to two opposition leaders being jailed in Venezuela?\nMS. SANDERS: Sorry, can you say that again?\nQ: What is the President's reaction to the two opposition leaders being jailed in Venezuela now after the sanctions from yesterday?\nMS. SANDERS: Overnight, the regime of the Venezuelan dictator Maduro detained two leading opposition figures following its outrageous seizure of power through sham elections this weekend. The Vice President spoke with Mr. Lopez just last week, and he and Mr. Ledezma are political prisoners held unjustly by the Maduro regime. The United States condemns the actions of the Maduro dictatorship, and we hold Maduro personally responsible for the health and safety of both men and any other seized by his dictatorship.\nQ: Is the President already considering increasing the sanctions and perhaps going after their oil exports?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to broadcast. As Secretary Mnuchin said yesterday, we'll consider all options and keep you guys updated.\nQ: On healthcare, you said earlier that what's keeping the President's agenda from going is Congress and their votes. The President has said he wants to see healthcare done before anything else, and yet that's not the message we've seen from the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the last few days. Can you explain the discrepancy between the President and senior Republican leadership on the Hill when it comes to what should be done next?\nMS. SANDERS: As we've said before, we can do a lot of different things at one time. We're continuing to focus --\nQ: But they're (inaudible) this things first.\nMS. SANDERS: We're continuing to try to push a new healthcare system. We know that Obamacare is failing. We know that inaction is simply not okay. We want to continue to make that a priority. We want to work with Congress to do that. We may look for other ways to improve healthcare in the meantime.\nWe're also continuing to focus on tax reform. We've been doing tax reform listening sessions for the last month. We've had countless meetings with members of Congress, other organizations, talking about tax reform, infrastructure. We're going to continue to focus on all of those priorities and move them forward.\nQ: Will the President support Congress taking CSR payments out of his hands? There's been some suggestion, again, among senior Republicans that this is appropriate to do given the President's threats to stop these payments. They're saying they should be taken out of the executive branch.\nMS. SANDERS: I'd have to get back to you on that.\nQ: Can you, please? Because this is something that's being discussed pretty aggressively on Capitol Hill. John Thune has talked about it. Orrin Hatch has talked about it.\nMS. SANDERS: I'm happy to get back to you about it.\nQ: Thanks.\nMS. SANDERS: Peter.\nQ: Sarah, very quickly on Seth Rich. Does the President believe the predicate about original Fox News reporting that Seth Rich was responsible for the release of DNC emails to WikiLeaks?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure, Peter.\nThanks, guys. We've got a small business event coming up shortly, and hopefully you'll all tune in.\nEND 2:48 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-08-01", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders"}

This influx is the equivalent of adding more than the population of San Francisco to the country every year.\n* More than 50 percent of all immigrant households receive welfare benefits, compared to only 30 percent of native households in the United States that receive welfare benefits.\n* Immigrants with a college education or higher are, on average, less likely to be welfare recipients than those without the same degree of education.\n* Since 1979, Americans with a high school diploma or less have seen their real hourly wages decline.\n* American workers without a high school diploma have seen their real hourly wages fall by 17 percent.\nTHE RAISE ACT PUTS AMERICAN WORKERS FIRST: President Donald J. Trump supports the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act to prioritize immigrants based on the skills they bring to our Nation while safeguarding the jobs of American workers.\n* The RAISE Act replaces the current permanent employment-visa framework with a skills-based system that rewards applicants based on their individual merits.\n* The system rewards education, English-language ability, high-paying job offers, past achievements, and entrepreneurial initiative.\n* This system is similar to the merit-based immigration systems used by Canada and Australia.\n* The RAISE Act reduces overall immigration numbers to limit low-skilled and unskilled labor entering the United States.\n* The RAISE Act prioritizes immediate family members of United States residents, including spouses and minor children, but ends preferences for extended family members and adult children.\n* United States citizens needing to take care of elderly parents can receive renewable, temporary visas for them.\n* The RAISE Act eliminates the outdated Diversity Visa lottery system, which serves questionable economic and humanitarian interests.\n* The RAISE Act limits permanent resident status for refugees to 50,000 a year, in line with the 13-year average.\nA PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: The RAISE Act follows through on President Trump's promise to the reform our immigration system to put America first.\n* President Trump on July 26, 2017:\n* \"As we speak, we are working with two wonderful Senators, Tom Cotton and David Perdue, to create a new immigration system for America. Instead of today's low-skill system, just a terrible system where anybody comes in.\"\n* President Trump on February 28, 2017:\n* \"Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on our taxpayers.\"\n* \"Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families -- including immigrant families -- enter the middle class.\"", "timestamp": "2017-08-02", "title": "Press Release - President Donald J.

Prime Minister Markovic, Prime Minister Zaev, Prime Minister Brnabic, Prime Minister Cerar, Prime Minister Plenkovic, Prime Minister Rama, , President Thaci, Minister Zvizdic, distinguished guests, it is my great honor to join you today to celebrate the progress of the Western Balkans here at this historic Adriatic Charter Summit. (Applause.)\nThe President of the United States, President Donald Trump, personally sent me here as a sign of our country's enduring commitment to the Western Balkans.\nIt's a special honor for me to be here today, as the very first Vice President of the United States to ever visit Montenegro.\nIt's remarkable to think that Montenegro reclaimed its independence just 11 years ago. But while Montenegro may be a young country, this is a land with an ancient history, and we are grateful for your leadership and hospitality today, Mr. Prime Minister.\nMontenegro's culture and traditions have long enriched the continent of Europe as a whole. And the same can be said of all the countries represented here today.\nThe Western Balkans show the diversity of Western civilization -- a beautiful mosaic of free countries and peoples -- each with their own unique histories, cultures, languages and traditions and all of which deserve to be cherished, celebrated, and protected.\nAnd the Adriatic Charter has played a leading role in bringing the Western Balkans into unity with Europe and alliance with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. And under President Trump, the United States of America will continue to support each of you as you pursue this future together. (Applause.)\nThe Adriatic Charter itself is a testament to the United States' commitment to the Western Balkans, and to Europe as a whole.\nEstablished in 2003, the Adriatic Charter serves our shared vision, and the United States of America remains committed to this day to a \"Europe whole, free, and at peace.\"\nThe charter began small -- with the United States, Albania, Croatia, Macedonia as founding members -- but today it's grown to encompass the entire Western Balkans.\nThe charter now counts Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina as members, and Serbia, Kosovo as observers, and we look forward to overcoming the obstacles for Kosovo to become a full member in the near future.\nAnd let there be no doubt: The Adriatic Charter is fulfilling its purpose to bring the states of the Western Balkans closer together into a most successful defense alliance in history, NATO itself.\nEight years ago, Albania and Croatia acceded to NATO, joining Slovenia, which is represented here today. And less than two months ago, NATO proudly welcomed the newest member of our historic alliance -- Montenegro.\nI actually had the privilege to personally congratulate Prime Minister Markovic at the White House on that very historic day. Mr. Prime Minister, on behalf of President Trump, and here with other NATO allies, allow me to thank you for your leadership and allow me to congratulate you and the people of Montenegro once again for successfully acceding to NATO. (Applause.)\nMy friends, Montenegro's accession proves that NATO's open door remains open. And so will it always be for those European countries that share our values, contribute to the common defense, and strive to achieve security, prosperity, and freedom for their people.\nAnd to all the leaders gathered here, let me assure you: Under President Donald Trump, the United States will continue to stand with you as you pursue your European future together.\nWhether your future is in NATO, the European Union, or both, the United States supports you -- because either path will strengthen Europe. And as President Trump said during his historic trip to Poland, in his words: \"A strong Europe is a blessing to the West and to the world.\"\nAnd by bringing the Adriatic ever closer to the Atlantic, we can ensure a brighter future not only for the Western Balkans, but for the West itself.\nUnder President Trump, the policy of the United States will always be to put the security and prosperity of America first. But as the President has made clear, and I hope as my presence here today demonstrates, America First does not mean America alone.\nThe bond between the United States and Europe has been, is now, and always will be essential -- for we are stronger together than we will ever be apart.\nDuring his visit to Poland last month, President Trump challenged all our allies and partners in Europe, and really all who cherish freedom, to renew in his words our \"commitment of will\" to confront the shared challenges that we face.\nAnd that commitment begins with you and the actions that you, the leaders of this region, take in the days and years ahead.\nThis is a time of great opportunity for each of your countries. Virtually every state in the Western Balkans has recently held free and fair national elections, with the participation of all political parties, and with a result that reflected the will of your people.\nThis is a historic accomplishment -- and President Trump and I congratulate each of you. You belong to a new generation of Balkan leaders, and this is a historic moment for progress in the Western Balkans. And so I urge you with great respect to make the most of this moment.\nYou have the opportunity to settle grievances of the past and bring people of different backgrounds and beliefs together in pursuit of the common good. You can strengthen your economies and open the pathway to prosperity for your people through tax and regulatory reform. You can tackle corruption and build accountable and transparent governments which will deliver on the highest aspirations of your people and build confidence among those who would invest in the prosperity of your future.\nThe task before you requires courage.\nBut your fellow citizens have placed their trust in you. They believe in your ability to help them realize their dreams for a more prosperous and peaceful future. And so do we.\nAs they say in Montenegro, \"In good times, it's easy to be good, but in adversity, heroes are recognized.\"\nSo today with great respect, I urge each of you to be the heroes your people deserve -- unlock the vast potential of your countries and realize our shared dream of a Europe whole, free, and at a peace.\nUnder President Trump, be assured, the United States will continue to support the Western Balkans as you take these important steps toward good government, democratic reform, and the rule of law.\nWe'll continue to support the Dayton Accords and the principles they represent, and we're committed to dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo to fully normalize relations between them.\nAnd throughout the Western Balkans, the United States will partner with your citizens to foster a vibrant civil society, a free and independent press, and an economy that opens opportunity for all who seek it.\nAnd we must never forget that security is the foundation of our prosperity, and the United States I can assure you will continue to partner with each of you as you promote security in the Western Balkans and beyond.\nWe'll continue to forge strong relationships between your armed forces and the Armed Forces of the United States, training alongside you and partnering with you to professionalize your militaries even further.\nWe'll continue to build your capability to operate alongside NATO and other Western forces. And the United States will partner with you to reduce your dependency on legacy Soviet and Russian military hardware.\nBut as President Trump has made clear, your defense requires your commitment as much as ours. Collective defense is the essential foundation of the NATO Alliance, and President Trump has made it clear that the United States expects all our allies, and all who would wish to join our alliance, to meet the minimum commitment of spending at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on their own national defense.\nThis investment is necessary to keep our solemn pledge that an attack on one is an attack on all. This oath requires action, and every NATO member and NATO aspirant must renew their commitment to our common defense -- and they must renew it now.\nWe must shoulder this responsibility together because the dangers we face are growing and changing every day. Throughout my trip, I have met with the brave men and women in uniform of the Armed Forces of the United States and our allies and our strategic partners. I'm always inspired. They're the best of us. And along with so many of your citizens, in Europe and across the wider world, they stand on the front lines of freedom. Their service and their sacrifice keep our families safe and our freedom strong.\nThese heroes stand guard at a pivotal time, for our world is now a more dangerous place than at any point since the collapse of communism a quarter of a century ago.\nAs President Trump said in Poland, we are now confronted by adversaries, as he said, from inside and out, from the South and the East, that \"threaten to undermine our values and erase the bonds of culture, faith, and tradition that make us who we are.\"\nAnd no enemy is more widespread than the global menace of radical Islamic terrorism. Terrorism threatens us all, from the Western Balkans, to Western Europe, to the United States of America.\nIt was less than one year ago that many of your countries disrupted the ISIS-inspired plans for coordinated attacks in Albania, Kosovo, and Macedonia.\nThe United States is grateful -- grateful for your contributions in the Global Campaign to Defeat ISIS, and in the fight against terror in Afghanistan. Our shared sacrifices on the field of battle have only brought us closer and strengthened our commitment to freedom.\nAnd make no mistake about it: President Trump and the United States of America under his leadership will not rest, we will not relent until we hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source so it can no longer threaten our people, our allies, or our way of life. (Applause.)\nAs our militaries and coalition forces drive ISIS from Iraq, and soon from its very existence, your countries will continue to face the danger of foreign fighters returning home from the Middle East, with the singular goal of sowing chaos and taking innocent lives.\nWe must be vigilant to this threat, a cancer in our countries, and we must be prepared to cut it out before it can fester and grow.\nBeyond terrorism, President Trump has called attention to in his words \"powers that seek to test our will, undermine our confidence, and challenge our interests.\"\nIn recent days we've seen the completion of Venezuela's collapse into dictatorship. Not only did the regime hold a sham National Assembly election, but on Monday night, the regime seized two prominent members of the opposition, Leopoldo Lopez and Antonio Ledezma, who are being held illegally as we speak.\nPresident Trump said yesterday, \"The United States condemns the actions of the Maduro dictatorship,\" and that we will hold Maduro personally responsible for the health and safety of these two brave men.\nThe United States calls on all who cherish freedom to condemn the Maduro regime for its abuse of power and its abuse of its own people. Venezuela deserves democracy, and the Venezuelan people deserve freedom.\nBeyond the Western Hemisphere, over the past week the world also witnessed, once again, the grave and growing threat posed by missile capabilities in the hands of dangerous regimes in North Korea and Iran.\nBoth regimes conducted provocative launches over a 24-hour span. Their actions have brought them closer to threatening our partners in their regions, our transatlantic alliance, and the American homeland itself.\nIn these times of widening threats and provocations, more than ever before, we must stand together in defense of all that we hold dear. We all have a vital role to play -- for all the countries gathered here today loom large in the tapestry of freedom.\nHere, in Europe, we must be resolute and uncompromising in the face of aggression from an unpredictable country that casts a shadow from the east, as well.\nAs you well know, Russia continues to seek to redraw international borders by force. And here, in the Western Balkans, Russia has worked to destabilize the region, undermine your democracies, and divide you from each other and from the rest of Europe.\nRussia's intentions were laid bare over the past year when Moscow-backed agents sought to disrupt Montenegro's elections, attack your parliament and even attempt to assassinate your Prime Minister to dissuade the Montenegrin people from entering our NATO Alliance.\nPresident Trump has called clearly on Russia to \"cease its destabilizing activities.\" And I can assure you: The United States of America rejects any attempt to use force, threats, or intimidation in this region or beyond. The Western Balkans have the right to decide your own future, and that is your right alone. (Applause.)\nThe United States will continue to hold Russia accountable for its actions, and we call on our European allies and friends to do the same. In a further sign of our commitment, very soon, President Trump will sign legislation to strengthen and codify the United States' current sanctions against Russia.\nLet me be clear: The United States prefers a constructive relationship with Russia based on mutual cooperation and common interests. But the President and our Congress are unified in our message to Russia -- a better relationship and the lifting of sanctions, will require Russia to reverse the actions and conduct that caused sanctions to be imposed in the first place.\nFinally, in these challenging times, President Trump has reminded us all that our fight, in his words, \"begins with our minds, our wills,\" and our very souls.\nSo let us steel our minds, strengthen our wills, and refresh our souls. For if we do, as the President has said, \"the West will never, ever be broken. Our values will prevail. Our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.\"\nMy friends in the Western Balkans, we gather at this historic Adriatic Charter Summit with the weight of history on our shoulders.\nFor 15 years, the United States has helped guide your countries as you walk the path toward peace at home, unity in Europe, and allied for our common defense. You need only seize the day. Take this opportunity, through your actions, to draw even closer to each other and to the West; complete the unfinished business of the Western Balkans; and finish the journey that we started together so many years ago.\nAnd as I say these words of admonition, I have faith -- I have faith you will succeed. We'll succeed together -- because I have faith in strong and good people of this region. I have faith in their aspiration and determination to embrace freedom for this generation and the next. And I have faith in the beautiful tapestry of belief that I have seen as I've traveled across Europe in recent days.\nI've seen many creeds, many rich and ancient traditions, but in them all, I've witnessed the power of faith to stir the soul and rekindle and renew the spirit. For as the Good Book says, where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.\nOurs is a shared future of security and prosperity. Ours is a shared future of liberty and freedom. United in this great \"community of nations,\" I know we'll face that future together.\nAnd with your help, and with God's help, we will achieve the vision of a Europe whole, free, and at peace.\nAnd so I say with confidence: With the courage of your people, with the commitment of this brave, new generation of Western Balkan leaders, with the strength of President Donald Trump and the United States of America, and with firm reliance on Almighty God, the future for the Western Balkans, the West itself, and the future of freedom is bright -- brighter than ever before. And we will meet that future as allies and friends together.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless all your nations and may God bless the United States of America.

{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128314", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:48 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon, everyone.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to hand it over to Stephen Miller, senior advisor to the President, to speak with you about the RAISE Act that the President endorsed this morning. And I know you guys will have lot of fun.\nTake it away, Stephen.\nMR. MILLER: Thank you. Great to be here today to talk with you about the President's new proposal for immigration reform. I'll just walk through the basics of it and then we'll take some questions and hopefully be able to answer all of them.\nSo this is the largest proposed reform to our immigration policy in half a century. The most important question when it comes to the U.S. immigration system is who gets a green card. A green card is the golden ticket of U.S. immigration.\nEvery year we issue a million green cards to foreign nationals from all the countries of the world, but we do so without regard to whether that applicant has demonstrated the skill that can add to the U.S. economy, whether they can pay their own way or be reliant on welfare, or whether they'll displace or take a job from an American worker.\nAnd as a result of this policy, in place now for many years, we've seen significant reductions in wages for blue collar workers, massive displacement of African American and Hispanic workers, as well as the displacement of immigrant workers from previous years who oftentimes compete directly against new arrivals who are being paid even less.\nSo it's a policy that's actually exacerbated wealth inequality in the country in a pretty significant way. So you've seen over time, as a result of this historic flow of unskilled immigration, a shift in wealth from the working class to wealthier corporations and businesses. And it's been very unfair for American workers, but especially for immigrant workers, African American workers, and Hispanic workers, and blue collar workers in general across the country.\nAt the same time, it has cost taxpayers enormously because roughly half of immigrant head of households in the United States receive some type of welfare benefit -- which I know is a fact that many people might consider astonishing, but it's not surprising when you have an immigration system that doesn't look at questions like skill level or self-sufficiency.\nAnd so this proposal has several major historic changes. First, it eliminates so-called chain migration. So right now, what does chain migration mean? It means that if you come into the United States on a green card -- and just so we're all clear, a green card gives the recipient lifetime work authorization, the ability to bring in their family members. It gives them a fast track to U.S. citizenship and, with that, all the benefits that come with being an American citizen.\nAnd so the individuals right now who are receiving green cards, they can bring in, say, an elderly relative who could immediately go on to public assistance if they become unable to support themselves financially. And then that person can bring in a relative who can bring in a relative who can bring in a relative, and that's why they call it chain migration. And over years, that has massively de-skilled the migrant flow into America and produced all of those effects I'm talking about.\nSo we're proposing to limit family-based migration to spouses and minor children. Additionally, we're establishing a new entry system that's points-based. Australia has a points-based system, Canada has a points-based system. And what will this system look at? It will look at: Does the applicant speak English? Can they support themselves and their families financially? Do they have a skill that will add to the U.S. economy? Are they being paid a high wage?\nThe last part is very important because it will help prevent displacement of U.S. workers. So if a company -- let's say they're offering three times the median wage, that person will get more points on their application than if they're being offered two times the median wage or one time the median wage. So all of a sudden, you're putting upward pressure on wages instead of downward pressure, and you're making it very hard to use immigrant labor to substitute for American workers because by prioritizing higher paid workers, you basically end the practice, more or less, of being able to seek out permanent residents to come in at lower pay.\nAnd so that's a major historic change to U.S. immigration policy. The effect of this, switching to a skills-based system and ending unfettered chain migration, would be, over time, you would cut net migration in half, which polling shows is supported overwhelmingly by the American people in very large numbers.\nAnd I'll just conclude by saying this is what President Trump campaigned on. He talked about it throughout the campaign, throughout the transition, and since coming into office.\nThis is a major promise to the American people to push for merit-based immigration reform that protects U.S. workers, protects U.S. taxpayers, and protects the U.S. economy, and that prioritizes the needs of our own citizens, our own residents, and our own workers. It's pro-American immigration reform that the American people want, that the American people deserve, and that puts the needs of the working class ahead of the investor class.\nSo with that, I would gladly take a few questions.\nQ: Thank you, Stephen. You talk about the President's agenda and wanting to implement it. But obviously if this doesn't become law, it won't be implemented, and there's already resistance in Congress, specifically from Republicans, even the day that you're rolling out this plan. How do you plan to overcome that? Where are the compromise points for the President and this White House?\nMR. MILLER: It's been my experience in the legislative process that there's two kinds of proposals. There's proposals that can only succeed in the dark of night and proposals that can only succeed in the light of day. This is the latter of those two.\nThe more that we as a country have a national conversation about what kind of immigration system we want and to whom we want to give green cards to, the more unstoppable the momentum for something like this becomes.\nQ: So there's room for change?\nMR. MILLER: Public support is so immense on this -- if you just look at the polling data in many key battleground states across the country -- that over time you're going to see massive public push for this kind of legislation. Because immigration affects every aspect of our lives. It affects our schools, our hospitals, our working conditions, our labor market, our tax base, our communities, and it's a deeply personal issue for Americans.\nAnd so you're going to see massive public support for this. And ultimately, members of Congress will have a choice to make. They can either vote with the interests of U.S. citizens and U.S. workers, or they can vote against their interests, and whatever happens as a result of that, I think would be somewhat predictable.\nLet me go to John and then we'll move back.\nQ: How do you wedge this into an already jam-packed legislative calendar?\nMR. MILLER: Well, ultimately we're going to have to have conversations with Senate leadership and House leadership about the steps forward. But this is an issue that we campaigned on, the American people voted for by electing Donald J. Trump as their President, and that is of enormous importance to the American economy. Because again, we're protecting blue-collar workers and we're bringing in workers who can add to the economy.\nAnd so I really think this is a really historic moment that happened today. Again, the biggest proposed change that would take place in 50 years. At a time in which you have automation that is replacing a lot of jobs in the United States, you have American workers without high school diplomas who have very low participation rates in the labor force, and then you're bringing in workers to compete directly against the workers who are either losing their jobs to automation or who can't find work because there's not enough jobs for workers in our own country without education.\nAnd so particularly -- I mean, go to an American city that has labor force problems, wherever that may be -- say, Detroit. How is it fair or right or proper that if, say, you open up a new business in Detroit, that the unemployed workers of Detroit are going to have to compete against an endless flow of unskilled workers for the exact same jobs, reducing pay for those positions, and reducing their chance of getting those jobs while, at the same time, ultra-high-skilled workers are in the back of the line to get into the country? It makes no sense. The numbers are too large, and the numbers of low-skilled workers in particular is a major detriment to U.S. workers.\nSo I think the more we have this conversation publicly and ask America who ought to get a green card in this country, the more momentum there's going to be, the more support there's going to be. And our message to folks in Congress is, if you are serious about immigration reform, then ask yourselves, what's in the best interest of Americans and American workers, and ultimately this has to be a part of that.\nAll right, let's go to Glenn.\nQ: Two quick questions. First of all, let's have some statistics. There have been a lot of studies out there that don't show a correlation between low-skilled immigration and the loss of jobs for native workers. Cite for me, if you could, one or two studies with specific numbers that prove the correlation between those two things -- because your entire policy is based on that.\nAnd secondly, I have sources that told me, about a month ago, that you guys have sort of elbowed infrastructure out of the way to get immigration on the legislative queue. Tell me why this is more important than infrastructure.\nMR. MILLER: Look, the latter statement isn't true.\nI think the most recent study I would point to is the study from George Borjas that he just did about the Mariel boatlift. And he went back and reexamined and opened up the old data, and talked about how it actually did reduce wages for workers who were living there at the time.\nAnd Borjas has, of course, done enormous amounts of research on this, as has Peter Kirsanow on the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, as has Steve Camarota at the Center for Immigration Studies, and so on and so --\nQ: How about the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine?\nMR. MILLER: Right. And their recent study said that as much as $300 billion a year may be lost as a result of our current immigration system in terms of folks drawing more public benefits than they're paying in.\nBut let's also use common sense here, folks. At the end of the day, why do special interests want to bring in more low-skilled workers? And why historically --\nQ: Stephen, I'm not asking for common sense. I'm asking for specific statistical data.\nMR. MILLER: Well, I think it's very clear, Glenn, that you're not asking for common sense, but if I could just answer your question.\nQ: No, no, not common sense. Common sense is fungible. Statistics are not.\nMR. MILLER: I named the studies, Glenn.\nQ: Let me just finish the question. Tell me the specific --\nMR. MILLER: Glenn, Glenn, Glenn -- I named the studies. I named the studies.\nQ: I asked you for a statistic. Can you tell me how many --\nMR. MILLER: Glenn, maybe we'll make a carve-out in the bill that says the New York Times can hire all the low-skilled, less-paid workers they want from other countries, and see how you feel then about low-wage substitution. This is a reality that's happening in our country.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. MILLER: Maybe it's time we had compassion, Glenn, for American workers. President Trump has met with American workers who have been replaced by foreign workers.\nQ: Oh, I understand. I'm not questioning any of that. I'm asking for --\nMR. MILLER: And ask them -- ask them how this has affected their lives.\nQ: I'm not asking them. I'm asking you for a number.\nMR. MILLER: Look at -- I just told you.\nQ: Give me the number of low-skilled jobs that Americans might otherwise have --\nMR. MILLER: If you look at -- first of all, if you look at the premise, Glenn, of bringing in low-skilled labor, it's based on the idea that there's a labor shortage for lower-skilled jobs. There isn't. The number of people living in the United States in the working ages who aren't working today is at a record high.\nOne in four Americans -- or almost one in four Americans between the ages of 25 and 54 aren't even employed. For African American workers, their labor force participation rate who don't have a high school diploma -- I guess, African American males without a high school diploma has plummeted some 40 percentage points since the mass wave of unskilled migration began.\nThe reality is that, if you just use common sense -- and, yes, I will use common sense -- the reason why some companies want to bring in more unskilled labor is because they know that it drives down wages and reduces labor costs.\nOur question as a government is, to whom is our duty? Our duty is to U.S. citizens and U.S. workers to promote rising wages for them. If low-skilled immigration was an unalloyed good for the economy, then why have we been growing at 1.5 percent for the last 17 years at a time of unprecedented new low-wage arrivals? The facts speak for themselves. At some point, we're accountable to reality.\nOn the other hand, like I said, you have ultra-high-skilled workers who are at the back of the line, which makes no sense in the year 2017.\nNeil, let me go to you.\nQ: You brought up the African American male stats. Are you now targeting the black unemployment rate that is traditionally and historically higher than the average American? Is that what you're looking at with this --\nMR. MILLER: There's no doubt at all -- and then I'll go to Neil -- but there's no doubt that it's very, very sad and very unfair that immigration policy, both legal and illegal, over the last several decades has had a deleterious impact on African American employment in general, and certainly African American males that has been quite tragic. And we, as a country, have to have a conversation about that.\nNeil.\nQ: Thanks very much. So one of the arguments made against this bill is that large-scale immigration will increase the total number of jobs. Senator Graham, for example, said he wants more immigration to bring in more restaurant jobs, more resort jobs, bed cleaning jobs, and such like. Is it better for this country to have more jobs or higher wages and higher productivity for Americans?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I think at the end of the day, President Trump has been clear that he is a pro-high-wage President. He ran as a pro-high-wage candidate, and that's what this policy will accomplish.\nAt the same time, to the point about economic growth, we're constantly told that unskilled immigration boosts the economy. But again, if you look at the last 17 years, we just know from reality that's not true. And if you look at wages, you can see the effects there. If you look at the labor force, you can see the effects there.\nAnd so again, we're ending unskilled chain migration, but we're also making sure that the great inventors of the world, the great scientists of the world, that people who have the next great piece of technology can come into the United States and compete in a competitive application process -- a points-based system that makes sense in the year 2017.\nAll right, let me go to you.\nQ: Two questions. One, you did personalize it with the New York Times, so normally this wouldn't be a question, but will the Trump organization stop bringing in foreign workers on visa programs to set an example for other businesses in the interim before this bill becomes law?\nMR. MILLER: Well, as you know, the only way to have immigration policy work is it has to be national; it has to be uniform. You can't have different rules and different procedures for different companies.\nThis bill, of course, doesn't deal with guest workers and temporary non-immigrant visas, which is, I think, what you're asking about, and that's a separate thing. But the President was clear, if you go back and look at his debate on this during the primary, where he said, as a businessman, my responsibility is to operate my business according to the laws of the United States as they exist. He said, as President, my responsibility is to pass laws that make sure we have an immigration system that prioritizes American workers. He said that throughout the campaign, and he said it as a candidate, and he said it now.\nBut just as a technical matter, you're talking about a different aspect of the immigration system. Today, we're talking about the green card system, but it's a good question.\nLet me move on. Over there.\nQ: My second question was --\nMR. MILLER: Hold on a second.\nQ: Thank you, Stephen. Just to take the question in another direction, USA Today and others have shown that over the last seven years, there's been a negative flow of immigration across the southern border. And of course, unemployment is at, perhaps, a 10-year low right now. So will there be enough workers in the southwest states if this policy were to go into effect?\nMR. MILLER: Well, yeah. So I think we're talking about different things, and I appreciate the question. Net migration overall has been at a record pace. You're talking, I think, just about some questions about net migration illegally across the southern border.\nQ: Correct.\nMR. MILLER: We're talking today about green card policy. Every year, we issue a million more green cards and it just keeps adding on every year after year after year. And so the supply of foreign labor is at a record high. I think the foreign-born population right now is 45 million and I think there's 25 million foreign workers in the United States.\nAll right. Right there.\nQ: Thank you, Stephen. Two questions for you. First, does the Trump administration plan to defend the DACA program that Texas and eight other states bring a lawsuit challenging the court?\nMR. MILLER: Well, we are not going to make an announcement on that today because there is ongoing litigation, and DOJ and DHS are reviewing that. But I will say that whatever we do is going to prioritize the interests of American citizens and workers.\nQ: Stephen, Zoe Daniel from Australian Broadcasting. You've talked about the Australian policy. Can you speak more specifically about what the administration likes and also how that extends into things like family sponsorship? You mentioned bringing in elderly relatives, for example, who might not be productive. Yet in Australia, adult children can sponsor their parents to immigrate. So which elements of the policy are you choosing that you might liken to Australia's?\nMR. MILLER: Right. So we looked at the Australian system, the Canadian system. We took things we liked. We added things that made sense for America and where we are as a country right now.\nOne of the things I think is the most compelling about the Australian system is the efforts to make sure that immigrants are financially self-sufficient and make sure they're able to pay for their own healthcare and things of that nature. And that's certainly one of the things we took from that, and obviously the points-based system that Canada has has a lot to recommend it. And we actually -- we took that and we added things that are all new to it and that were released today, and made sure that we have a highly competitive application process.\nLook, there's 7 billion people in the world, and so the question of who gets that golden ticket needs to be a discerning process that makes sense. Again, in an environment in which you have this huge pool of unemployed labor in the United States, and you're spending massive amounts of money putting our own workers on welfare, doesn't it make sense economically to say, let's get our own workers, immigrant and U.S.-born, off of welfare, into the labor market, earning a living wage, able to pay into taxes, instead of bringing in lower-wage substitutes while at the same time ensuring that the inventors, the innovators, and the scientists are able to come into our country and add to our economy and our GDP, but not as substitutes for Americans?\nNBC.\nQ: Thank you so much. Can you respond to some of the critics within your own party who say what we really should be focused on is comprehensive immigration reform in order to really tackle the problem in a serious way? And secondly, what do you say to those who say this just separates families and it's effectively cutting an effective (inaudible)?\nMR. MILLER: Well, actually, legislation for folks who are already here, they are able -- who have pending family-based sponsorships -- they're actually grandfathered in. So it's a new system moving forward. Point one.\nAnd point two is that, beyond the immediate family members that are covered in the bill -- i.e. your minor children and your spouses -- your other relatives can come in; they just have to come in through the points-based system.\nAnd then your first part of your question?\nQ: My question about comprehensive immigration reform. Some Republicans are saying that you should be focused on comprehensive immigration reform instead of a sliver of the problem in order to really address the growing -- problem of immigration. Why not tackle it from that stance?\nMR. MILLER: Let me ask a hypothetical, and I mean it in all sincerity. Let's say that we had introduced a 2000-page comprehensive immigration reform bill. Would we be having this conversation today about Green Card policy? I suspect we wouldn't be. I think it's time that we forced the conversation onto this core issue. I know the President feels that it's enormously advantageous to have a conversation about this core aspect of immigration reform because it does receive so little discussion, and yet it's so enormously important.\nQ: Follow-up on that Stephen?\nMR. MILLER: Hold on. Let's go to you.\nQ: Thank you, Stephen. You mentioned lawmakers have a choice to make. Is President Trump going to make this a campaign issue next year?\nMR. MILLER: Well, we're making it an issue, period, starting -- well, he started in the campaign when he was running, but as far as a real push for change, that begins in earnest aggressively starting today. And I do think -- I just work on the policy side -- but I do think that voters across the country are going to demand these kind of changes because, again, of the effects it has on their lives and their communities.\nAnd this is overwhelmingly popular. And I challenge any news organization here: Do a poll. Ask these questions: Do you think we should favor applicants to our country who speaks English? Yes or no? Do you think that we should make sure that workers who come into our country don't displace existing American workers? Do you think people who come into our country should receive welfare or be financially self-sufficient? Do you think we should prioritize people based on skill? Do you think that we should reduce overall net migration? Do you think we should have unlimited family chain migration?\nIf you ask any of these questions -- look at the polls. Look at the results you'll get in your own news organizations, and they'll be very clear.\nQ: Two for you. First, following up on Noah's question, the President has talked a lot about immigration reform -- this has been held up in the past. He has the power today to take personal action on this by changing the way his Trump properties, Mar-a-Lago and others, bring in unskilled foreign workers, displacing, as you talked about, large numbers of Americans who are looking for work in these states. So is the President planning on taking that action?\nAnd secondly, does this signal that the White House does not believe that any sort of comprehensive action on immigration is possible with this Congress; that immigration needs to be tackled in a piecemeal fashion going forward?\nMR. MILLER: Well, again, just as a technical matter, you're talking about non-immigrant and guest worker visas, and this legislation deals with Green Cards, i.e. permanent immigration. So they're two totally separate categories.\nBut I'll just refer everyone here today back to the President's comments during the primary when this was raised in a debate, and he said: My job as a businessman is to follow the laws of the United States. And my job as President is to create an immigration system that works for American workers.\nAnd that's one of the reasons why I think Americans so deeply admire President Trump is because they see every day he's not working for himself. He has said over and over again: I've been very successful. I've had a great life. Now I'm here to work for the American people.\nBut for any immigration system to be functional and to work, it has to be uniform across the board. One standard for everyone.\nQ: Can you say how close the President is to getting a nominee for DHS? And can you add -- if this legislation is not moving by the end of the year, how much is it possible for you to do through executive action, if any?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I certainly think that on the administrative action front, you can tighten up and continue to tighten up enforcement on visas rules and standards. And I think that's certainly something that we'd been looking at doing. But we'd like to create a permanent change to our immigration system that will endure through time, that will still be in place many decades from now. And that's what this legislation would accomplish.\nAnd I would just, again, encourage everyone to understand the depth of this change. What President Trump has done today is one of the most important legislative moves that we've seen on this issue in many, many years. The President of the United States said, I'm taking a stand today for American workers and the American economy, and we're putting American families first on immigration. We're saying our compassion, first and foremost, is for struggling American families, and our focus is on the national interest.\nThat is a major event, and all of your news organizations should take a hard look at the polls on these questions and see where folks are. And you'll see that this is an issue that's supported by Democrats, independents, and Republicans across the board.\nOne last question and then I'll hand it back to Sarah.\nQ: (Inaudible) any polls?\nMR. MILLER: Maybe more than one. Maybe two.\nI hear a lot of energy -- I'm getting a lot of energy from upfront here.\nQ: If this is so huge and major -- you make it sound so enormously important -- why did the senators who were with the President today call it modest and incremental? Is it modest and incremental? And aside from that, you seem to be suggesting this is immigration reform. Does this come even close to stemming illegal immigration for the President?\nMR. MILLER: So, of course, the answer is that it's the divide between how Americans think about immigration and how Washington thinks about immigration. So to everyday Americans, this is the most rational, modest, commonsense, basic thing you can do. Of course, you shouldn't have foreign workers --\nQ: So it's modest and incremental?\nMR. MILLER: Of course, you shouldn't have foreign workers displacing American workers. In Washington, this represents a sea change from decades of practice. So it just depends what lens you're looking at it through.\nQ: An incremental sea change? (Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: It just depends what lens you're looking at it through. I guarantee you, go to, say, like an ed board for a couple of your papers, and see what they think about it. They'll see it as a sea change. Talk to an everyday guy in the street and he'll say this is the most commonsense thing -- or she'll say this is the most commonsense thing that I've seen in my entire life. And it's right down, straight, the center of American politics and American political views.\nSo I'll take one last question. Who has -- so I'll do for the last question, right here.\nQ: Thank you. I appreciate it. And thank you very much for coming out here and talking to us on camera. But I'd like to ask you if you've recently spoken with your old boss and what you make of the rift between President Trump and the Attorney General. You worked for Jeff Sessions for many years.\nMR. MILLER: I think Sarah has already spoken about that at length, and that's not why I'm here today. But I think, if I remember what she said correctly, I'll say it again: The President has confidence in all of his Cabinet and expects them to perform their duties honorably and fully and on behalf of the American people.\nBut since the last question is not on the subject at hand, I will take one actual last question on the subject at hand.\nYes.\nQ: What you're proposing, or what the President is proposing here does not sound like it's in keeping with American tradition when it comes to immigration. The Statue of Liberty says, \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\" It doesn't say anything about speaking English or being able to be a computer programmer.\nAren't you trying to change what it means to be an immigrant coming into this country if you're telling them you have to speak English? Can't people learn how to speak English when they get here?\nMR. MILLER: Well, first of all, right now it's a requirement that to be naturalized you have to speak English. So the notion that speaking English wouldn't be a part of our immigration system would be actually very ahistorical.\nSecondly, I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of liberty and lighting the world. It's a symbol of American liberty lighting the world. The poem that you're referring to, that was added later, is not actually a part of the original Statue of Liberty.\nBut more fundamentally, the history --\nQ: You're saying that that does not represent what the country --\nMR. MILLER: I'm saying that the notion --\nQ: -- has always thought of as immigration coming into this country?\nMR. MILLER: I'm saying the notion --\nQ: Stephen, I'm sorry, but that sounds like some --\nMR. MILLER: Jim, let me ask you a question.\nQ: That sounds like some National Park revisionism. (Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: No. What I'm asking you is --\nQ: The Statue of Liberty has always been a beacon of hope to the world for people to send their people to this country --\nMR. MILLER: Jim -- Jim, do you believe --\nQ: -- and they're not always going to speak English, Stephen. They're not always going to be highly skilled. They're not always going to be somebody who can go to work at Silicon Valley right away.\nMR. MILLER: Jim, I appreciate your speech. So let's talk about this.\nQ: It was a modest and incremental speech.\nMR. MILLER: Jim, let's talk about this. In 1970, when we let in 300,000 people a year, was that violating or not violating the Statue of Liberty law of the land? In the 1990s, when it was half-a-million a year, was it violating or not violating the Statue of Liberty law of the land?\nQ: Was it violating the Statue of Liberty and the --\nMR. MILLER: No, tell me what years -- tell me what years --\nQ: (Inaudible) call for a deportation force?\nMR. MILLER: Tell me what years meet Jim Acosta's definition of the Statue of Liberty poem law of the land. So you're saying a million a year is the Statue of Liberty number? 900,000 violates it? 800,000 violates it?\nQ: You're sort of bringing a \"press one for English\" philosophy here to immigration, and that's never been what the United States has been about, Stephen. I mean, that's just the case --\nMr. MILLER: But your statement is also shockingly ahistorical in another respect, too -- which is, if you look at the history of immigration, it's actually ebbed and flowed. You've had periods of very large waves, followed by periods of less immigration and more immigration. And during the --\nQ: We're in a low period of immigration right now. The President wants to build a wall and you want to bring about a sweeping change to the immigration system.\nMR. MILLER: Surely, Jim, you don't actually think that a wall affects Green Card policy. You couldn't possibly believe that, or do you? Actually, the notion that you actually think immigration is at a historic lull -- the foreign-born population in the United States today --\nQ: The President was just with the new Chief of Staff on Monday talking about how border crossings were way down.\nMR. MILLER: I want to be serious, Jim. Do you really at CNN not know the difference between Green Card policy and illegal immigration? You really don't know the --\nQ: Sir, my father was a Cuban immigrant. He came to this country in 1962 right before the Cuban Missile Crisis and obtained a Green Card.\nYes, people who immigrate to this country can eventually -- people who immigrate to this country not through Ellis Island, as your family may have, but in other ways, do obtain a Green Card at some point. They do it through a lot of hard work. And, yes, they may learn English as a second language later on in life. But this whole notion of \"well, they have to learn English before they get to the United States,\" are we just going to bring in people from Great Britain and Australia?\nMR. MILLER: Jim, it's actually -- I have to honestly say I am shocked at your statement that you think that only people from Great Britain and Australia would know English. It's actually -- it reveals your cosmopolitan bias to a shocking degree that in your mind --\nQ: Sir, it's not a cosmopolitan --\nMR. MILLER: No, this is an amazing moment. This an amazing moment. That you think only people from Great Britain or Australia would speak English is so insulting to millions of hardworking immigrants who do speak English from all over the world.\nQ: My father came to this country not speaking any English.\nMR. MILLER: Jim, have you honestly never met an immigrant from another country who speaks English outside of Great Britain and Australia? Is that your personal experience?\nQ: Of course, there are people who come into this country from other parts of the world.\nMR. MILLER: But that's not what you said, and it shows your cosmopolitan bias. And I just want to say --\nQ: It just sounds like you're trying to engineer the racial and ethnic flow of people into this country through this policy.\nMR. MILLER: Jim, that is one of the most outrageous, insulting, ignorant, and foolish things you've ever said, and for you that's still a really -- the notion that you think that this is a racist bill is so wrong and so insulting.\nQ: I didn't say it was a racist bill.\nMR. MILLER: Jim, the reality is, is that the foreign-born population into our country has quadrupled since 1970. That's a fact. It's been mostly driven by Green Card policy. Now, this bill allows for immediate nuclear family members to come into the country, much as they would today, and it adds an additional points-based system. The people who have been hurt the most --\nQ: You're saying that people have to be English speaking when they're naturalized. What is this English-speaking component that you've inserted into this? I don't understand.\nMR. MILLER: The people who have been hurt the most by the policy you're advocating are --\nQ: What policy am I advocating?\nMR. MILLER: Apparently, just unfettered, uncontrolled migration. The people who have been hurt the most by the policy --\nQ: (Inaudible) is for open borders. That's the same tired thing that --\nMR. MILLER: The people who have been hurt the most by the policy you're advocating are immigrant workers and minority workers and African American workers and Hispanic workers.\nQ: Are you targeting the African American community? Now you brought it up again -- you said you wanted to have a conversation and not target. Is it going to be a targeted effort? You keep using the African American community. Are you going to target? I'm not trying to be funny, but you keep saying this.\nMR. MILLER: Right, I know. What you're saying is 100 percent correct.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. MILLER: We want to help unemployed African Americans in this country and unemployed workers of all backgrounds get jobs. And insinuations like Jim made trying to ascribe nefarious motives to a compassion immigration measure designed to help newcomers and current arrivals alike is wrong. And this is a positive, optimist proposal that says 10 years, 20 years, 30 years from now --\nQ: Sir, I didn't call you ignorant. You called me ignorant on national television. Honestly, I think that's just inappropriate.\nMR. MILLER: -- we want to have an immigration system that takes care of the people who are coming here and the people who are already living here by having standards, by having a real clear requirement that you should be able to support yourself financially, by making sure that employers can pay a living wage. That's the right policy for our country, and it's the President's commitment to taking care of American workers.\nI apologize, Jim, if things got heated. But you did make some pretty rough insinuations.\nQ: I don't know what you mean by rough insinuations. I don't know what that means.\nMR: MILLER: So, thank you. Thank you. And I'll hand it over to Sarah.\nI think that went exactly as planned. I think that was what Sarah was hoping would happen. (Laughter.)\nQ: I think she'd like to reclaim her time.\nMR. MILLER: I think that was exactly what we were hoping to have happened. Thank you.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you, Stephen. Well, the transition back should be pretty fun and simple. Thank you. That was exciting.\nThroughout this week we've been talking about the American Dream and all that it signifies for people of all ages and nationalities. This morning, Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway and Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump hosted a listening session with military spouses on the unique challenges they face in finding and maintaining employment to support their families.\nAnd yesterday, we hosted over 100 small businesses for a discussion on how they help to keep the American Dream alive for millions of workers around the country.\nAs I mentioned last week, I want to take time to recognize people from around the country that write in and ask the President questions. And today I wanted to read you a special letter to the President from someone who embodies the enterprising and ambitious spirit of America.\nFrank from Falls Church, Virginia wrote: \"Dear Mr. President, it would be my honor to mow the White House lawn for some weekend for you. Even though I'm only 10, I'd like to show the nation what young people like me are ready for. I admire your business background and have started my own business.\nI have been mowing my neighbors' lawns for some time. (Please see the attached flier). Here's a list of what I have and you are free to pick whatever you want: power mower, push mower, and weed whacker. I can bring extra fuel for the power mower and charged batteries for the weed whacker.\" And he'll do that with no charge.\n\"Sincerely,\nFrank\"\nFrank, I'm happy to report back to you that I just spoke with the President and he wanted me to be sure and tell you that you're doing a great job and keep working hard. He also asked me -- we found out when we called -- to let you know that we would be reading this letter to wish you a Happy Birthday. I think Frank went from 10 to 11 in the time that we received and were able to respond to this letter. And he also wanted me to invite you to spend a morning here at the White House with the groundskeeper. The groundskeeper -- we've talked to them, and they would love to show you how the U.S. Park Service maintains the 18 acres of the White House complex. And he'd love to give you the opportunity to cut the grass in the Rose Garden.\nIt's our responsibility to keep the American Dream alive for kids like Frank, immigrants who are already here, and those who dream of immigrating here in the future.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions.\nJustin.\nQ: Does the President believe that white applicants to college are the victims of discrimination?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: Does the President believe that white applicants to college are the victims of discrimination?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of that opinion at all. I certainly haven't had that conversation or have any reason to --\nQ: So can you explain why the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is devoting its limited time and resources to --\nMS. SANDERS: Quite an accusatory question, but I'd be happy to respond. The New York Times article is based entirely on uncorroborated inferences from a leaked internal personnel posting in violation of Department of Justice policy. And while the White House does not confirm or deny the existence of potential investigations, the Department of Justice will always review credible allegations of discrimination on the basis of any race. And I don't have anything further on that.\nQ: Sarah, thank you. Why did the President say that he received a phone call from the leader of the Boy Scouts and the President of Mexico when he did not? Did he lie?\nMS. SANDERS: No. On Mexico, he was referencing the conversation that they had had at the G20 Summit, where they specifically talked about the issues that he referenced.\nIn terms of the Boy Scouts, multiple members of the Boy Scout leadership, following his speech there that day, congratulated him, praised him, and offered quite -- I'm looking for the word -- quite powerful compliments following his speech. And those were what those references were about.\nQ: But the President specifically said that he received a phone call from the President of Mexico and the leader of the --\nMS. SANDERS: They were actually -- they were direct conversations, not actual phone calls.\nQ: So he lied? He didn't receive that phone call?\nMS. SANDERS: I wouldn't say it was a lie. That's a pretty bold accusation.\nQ: How would you --\nMS. SANDERS: The conversations took place. They just simply didn't take place over a phone call; that he had them in person.\nJohn.\nQ: Sarah, if I could ask a couple of questions about Russia. Dmitry Medvedev, the Prime Minister, has weighed in on the President's signing of the sanctions, saying that this proves that the Trump administration is \"utterly powerless\" and ends hopes for better ties. What's the White House response?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, this morning, the President signed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. The President favors tough measures to punish and deter the bad behavior of the rogue regimes in Iran and North Korea. And he also sent a clear signal that we won't tolerate interference in our democratic process by Russia.\nThe bill was improved, but Congress has encroached on the power of the presidency, and he signed it in the interest of national unity. We've been very clear that we support tough sanctions on all three of those countries. We continue to do so. And that has certainly not changed, and I think that was reflected in the statements today.\nQ: One point on one of the finer aspects of the bill and the findings -- it stated that Russia did, in fact, try to interfere in the U.S. election. In the President's statement -- on the signing statement, he did not quibble with that. Is that an indication that he does accept the finding that Russia interfered in our election?\nMS. SANDERS: The President has already said that himself directly at the press conference in Poland.\nQ: He's also said that other actors may have been involved.\nMS. SANDERS: May have been involved as well. But he doesn't dispute the fact that Russia was, and he said that in Poland at the press conference that I believe you were present for.\nQ: One more. You said on Monday that, when you had something to say about the Russian action on the 755 diplomats, you would say something about it. Do you have anything to say about it today?\nMS. SANDERS: No, I don't. But when I do, I'll let you know.\nKristen.\nQ: Sarah, thanks. Did President Trump speak with Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, prior to signing the bill or at all today?\nMS. SANDERS: No.\nQ: That's definitive? That's confirmed? Let me just ask you something about North Korea. General McCaffrey said that, \"I think at some point we are clearly going to take dramatic action short of war against North Korea.\" Can you respond to that? Do you think that's an accurate characterization? Can you tell us where the administration's thinking is right now when it comes to taking some type of military action against North Korea to stop its provocations?\nMS. SANDERS: As I've said many times before, we're not going to broadcast our actions, and we're keeping all options on the table.\nJordan.\nQ: Thank you. I'll ask you the question I was going to ask Stephen. The President said in an Economist interview in May -- he was asked whether he supports cutting the number of immigrants who can come here legally. He said, no. This bill today that he supports would cut the number of green cards issued by half. So when did the President have a change of heart on this issue?\nMS. SANDERS: I'd have to see the specific reference. But I know that the President has talked pretty frequently about merit-based immigration reform, not just on the campaign trail, but he's been talking about this for years. And I can't comment on a story I haven't seen specifically.\nQ: I mean, merit-based wouldn't necessarily lead to the reduction of total green cards. So does he have a separate opinion about the number of green cards that --\nMS. SANDERS: I think Stephen spoke pretty extensively on that, and I don't have anything to add beyond that.\nJon.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sarah. The President, in signing this sanctions bill today, issued a signing statement. And in that signing statement, he said that the bill is significantly flawed. He said that there are provisions in this bill that are clearly unconstitutional. Why would he sign this bill if he felt so strongly that this bill inhibits his ability to act as the Commander-in-Chief and to carry out his duties as President?\nMS. SANDERS: I think I spoke on this already, but primarily because the President favors tough measures to punish and deter the bad behavior of the rogue regimes in Iran and North Korea, and he also sent a clear signal that we won't tolerate interference in our democratic process by Russia. I also said that he signed it in the interest of national unity and, again, in support of -- there's no question that there isn't support for the principles of the bill; it's maybe just some of the process pieces.\nSteve.\nQ: I'm sorry -- does he also send a signal in signing this particular legislation that, if another bill comes before his desk that he also finds significantly flawed and clearly unconstitutional, that he'd sign that legislation as well?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to speak about a hypothetical bill that we don't know and doesn't exist and whether or not the President is going to sign it.\nSteve.\nQ: Sarah, can you clear up some confusion? There were almost simultaneously two signing statements that went out. They had slightly different language. Did you intend to send both out, or was that a mistake?\nMS. SANDERS: It was actually one signing statement and one press statement, so that's the difference. One is more of a legal document that goes with the executive secretary, and the other one is a press document. So that's the difference.\nQ: I wanted to bring up some unfinished business. When you were named Press Secretary, because there was so much focus on the other announcement, that you only had a chance to talk about the job in one question. So I wanted to give you a chance to answer two questions that all of your predecessors faced. The first one is, what is your overall approach to the job, especially in terms of balancing whether you're serving the President or serving the public? And secondly, do you see any circumstances where it's appropriate to lie from the podium?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll take the second one first. Absolutely not. I don't think it's appropriate to lie from the podium or any other place.\nOn the first question, I think that the balance -- my job is to communicate the President's agenda, the President's message, and answer your questions on that as best that I can, as honestly as I can, and as transparent as I can possibly be at any given moment.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Following up on the question about the position, what exactly is Sean Spicer's role in this administration at this point? And how much longer do you expect him to stay on staff? And then something on the signing statement.\nMS. SANDERS: As he said, I believe that was, gosh, a week or so ago. The days all kind of run together now. But he was going to stay on in a transition process through August, and nothing has changed.\nQ: So nothing changed because of Anthony Scaramucci leaving?\nMS. SANDERS: No, nothing has changed at this point.\nQ: Okay, and then on the signing statement, one of the things that it said was that it would drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together -- these sanctions. Can you elaborate on that? Because yesterday you suggested that China was both an ally and a partner.\nMS. SANDERS: I don't have anything to comment beyond the signing statement itself.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sarah, can I just follow up? Two questions. On DHS, should we expect that more into September, when Congress comes back, a nomination? Or is that possible soon? And the second question is, lots of lawmakers, Republicans on the Hill, and the business community have been concerned that the President won't stay focused on tax reform, that this is something they really want him to talk about. And you just introduced immigration. You've got healthcare still hanging. Is the President going to focus on all of those issues in the weeks ahead, going into September? Or does he really want to showcase just one or two things?\nMS. SANDERS: As we've said many times before, we can walk and chew gum at the same time, and we can work on a multitude of issues at the same time.\nIn terms of the DHS appointment, I don't have any personnel announcements at this time.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Yeah, thank you, Sarah. This morning, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, took a shot at Tom Homan, the head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement. On June the 28th, right from that podium, Mr. Homan said, and I quote, \"Most law enforcement officials in cities work with us but many don't in the largest cities. And that's where criminal aliens and criminal gangs flourish.\" Mayor Landrieu this morning said he's wrong about that; that kind of rhetoric is not helpful. And he added that police officers keep the streets safe irrespective of immigration status, and do so all the time. Your response to Mayor Landrieu and his charge against someone who is mentioned frequently to be the next Secretary of Homeland Security?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think Tom has served our country well. He's been active in law enforcement. And I would certainly trust his opinion very -- a lot of confidence in him and his ability, having been in a multitude of different positions within law enforcement and been able to see it in a lot of different places, not just one location, like the mayor. So I would certainly defer to Tom on this issue.\nQ: So then you would -- you trust him more than you would Mayor Landrieu on that issue?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that's pretty safe to say, John.\nJim.\nQ: Yes. Jeff Flake, in a Politico Magazine article, said the President was -- he suggested the President was a carnival barker and had eroded conservatism. Is the President still thinking of helping to fund the $10 million challenge against Senator Flake? And does he have any response to Senator Flake's comments?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure about any potential funding of a campaign. But I think that Senator Flake would serve his constituents much better if he was less focused on writing a book and attacking the President, and passing legislation.\nAlex.\nQ: Two American soldiers were killed today in Afghanistan. That's nine on the year. Does the President know about this? And does he feel any sense of urgency to implement a new plan in the conflict there?\nMS. SANDERS: I can't comment on that at this time, but I'll certainly keep you posted.\nTrey.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Did President Trump feel pressured into sign the Russia sanctions bill?\nMS. SANDERS: No. As I've said, the President supports putting pressure on these three countries in particular, and so he supports the principle of it and wanted to take action in that course.\nSteve.\nQ: I just wanted to follow up. You were asked yesterday by Jared Rizzi whether the President would weigh in on this question of cost-sharing payments. Can you put this to bed? Will the administration continue making these cost-sharing payments or not?\nMS. SANDERS: The CSR payments are belling out at this point -- a failed law that the President wants to repeal and replace. Since last year's campaign, the President has been clear that Obamacare is a failed law. He's working with his staff and his Cabinet to consider the issues raised by the CSR payments. And without Congress fulfilling its promise to American voters in repealing and replacing Obamacare, insurers will continue to flee this failing system. We need real reform that actually lowers cost and provides more choice for Americans. And we'll keep you posted when we have a final announcement on that.\nThanks so much, guys.\nEND 3:40 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 11:39 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included the remarks of Sens. Cotton and Perdue.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128093", "text": "Thank you very much. It's great to be here today to unveil legislation that would represent the most significant reform to our immigration system in a half a century. I want to thank Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue for their tremendous work in putting together this historic and very vital proposal.\nAs a candidate, I campaigned on creating a merit-based immigration system that protects U.S. workers and taxpayers, and that is why we are here today. Merit-based.\nThe RAISE Act—R-A-I-S-E—the RAISE Act will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. It will do this by changing the way the United States issues green cards to nationals from other countries. Green cards provide permanent residency, work authorization, and fast track to citizenship.\nFor decades, the United States was operated and has operated a very low-skilled immigration system, issuing record numbers of green cards to low-wage immigrants. This policy has placed substantial pressure on American workers, taxpayers, and community resources. Among those hit the hardest in recent years have been immigrants and, very importantly, minority workers competing for jobs against brand new arrivals. And it has not been fair to our people, to our citizens, to our workers.\nThe RAISE Act ends chain migration and replaces our low-skilled system with a new points-based system for receiving a green card. This competitive application process will favor applicants who can speak English, financially support themselves and their families, and demonstrate skills that will contribute to our economy.\nThe RAISE Act prevents new migrants and new immigrants from collecting welfare and protects U.S. workers from being displaced. And that's a very big thing. They're not going to come in and just immediately go and collect welfare. That doesn't happen under the RAISE Act. They can't do that. Crucially, the green card reforms in the RAISE Act will give American workers a pay raise by reducing unskilled immigration.\nThis legislation will not only restore our competitive edge in the 21st century, but it will restore the sacred bonds of trust between America and its citizens. This legislation demonstrates our compassion for struggling American families who deserve an immigration system that puts their needs first and that puts America first.\nFinally, the reforms in the RAISE Act will help ensure that newcomers to our wonderful country will be assimilated, will succeed, and will achieve the American Dream.\nI'd like now to invite Senator Cotton and Senator Perdue to say a few words. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n[At this point, Sens. Thomas B. Cotton and David A. Perdue, Jr., made brief remarks. The President then concluded as follows.]\nThank you, David. I just want to state that, as you probably have noticed, the stock market hit an alltime record high today, over 22,000. We've picked up, substantially now, more than $4 trillion in net worth in terms of our country, our stocks, our companies. We have a growth rate—a GDP—which has been much higher than, as you know, anybody anticipated, except maybe us. But then, it's going to go up. It's going to go higher too. We're doing a job.\nAnd you're going to see, jobs are pouring back into the country. The factories and plants are coming back into the country. We're going to start making product in America again. And that's happening all over. As I mentioned yesterday, Foxconn is going to spend $10 billion in Wisconsin and other places. And I think the $10 billion is going to end up being $30 billion. They make the iPhones for Apple and others, and it is a truly incredible company.\nSo we have a lot of things happening that are really great. But again, today the stock market hit the highest level that it has ever been, and our country is doing very well.\nI just want to thank you all. Tom and David are going to be outside. They're going to speak to you at length about what we're going to do with respect to this aspect of immigration. I think it's going to be very, very important, the biggest in 50 years—biggest change in 50 years.\nThank you all very much.", "timestamp": "2017-08-02", "title": "Remarks on Immigration Reform Legislation"}

I favor tough measures to punish and deter bad behavior by the rogue regimes in Tehran and Pyongyang. I also support making clear that America will not tolerate interference in our democratic process and that we will side with our allies and friends against Russian subversion and destabilization. That is why, since taking office, I have enacted tough new sanctions on Iran and North Korea and shored up existing sanctions on Russia.\nSince this bill was first introduced, I have expressed my concerns to Congress about the many ways it improperly encroaches on Executive power, disadvantages American companies, and hurts the interests of our European allies.\nMy administration has attempted to work with Congress to make this bill better. We have made progress and improved the language to give the Treasury Department greater flexibility in granting routine licenses to American businesses, people, and companies. The improved language also reflects feedback from our European allies, who have been steadfast partners on Russia sanctions, regarding the energy sanctions provided for in the legislation. The new language also ensures our agencies can delay sanctions on the intelligence and defense sectors, because those sanctions could negatively affect American companies and those of our allies.\nStill, the bill remains seriously flawed, particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch's authority to negotiate. Congress could not even negotiate a health care bill after 7 years of talking. By limiting the executive's flexibility, this bill makes it harder for the United States to strike good deals for the American people and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together. The Framers of our Constitution put foreign affairs in the hands of the President. This bill will prove the wisdom of that choice.\nYet, despite its problems, I am signing this bill for the sake of national unity. It represents the will of the American people to see Russia take steps to improve relations with the United States. We hope there will be cooperation between our two countries on major global issues so that these sanctions will no longer be necessary. Further, the bill sends a clear message to Iran and North Korea that the American people will not tolerate their dangerous and destabilizing behavior. America will continue to work closely with our friends and allies to check those countries' malignant activities.\nI built a truly great company worth many billions of dollars. That is a big part of the reason I was elected.

For instance, although I share the policy views of sections 253 and 257, those provisions purport to displace the President's exclusive constitutional authority to recognize foreign governments, including their territorial bounds, in conflict with the Supreme Court's recent decision in Zivotofsky v. Kerry.\nAdditionally, section 216 seeks to grant the Congress the ability to change the law outside the constitutionally required process. The bill prescribes a review period that precludes the President from taking certain actions. Certain provisions in section 216, however, conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in INS v. Chadha, because they purport to allow the Congress to extend the review period through procedures that do not satisfy the requirements for changing the law under Article I, section 7 of the Constitution. I nevertheless expect to honor the bill's extended waiting periods to ensure that the Congress will have a full opportunity to avail itself of the bill's review procedures.\nFurther, certain provisions, such as sections 254 and 257, purport to direct my subordinates in the executive branch to undertake certain diplomatic initiatives, in contravention of the President's exclusive constitutional authority to determine the time, scope, and objectives of international negotiations. And other provisions, such as sections 104, 107, 222, 224, 227, 228, and 234, would require me to deny certain individuals entry into the United States, without an exception for the President's responsibility to receive ambassadors under Article II, section 3 of the Constitution. My Administration will give careful and respectful consideration to the preferences expressed by the Congress in these various provisions and will implement them in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations.\nFinally, my Administration particularly expects the Congress to refrain from using this flawed bill to hinder our important work with European allies to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, and from using it to hinder our efforts to address any unintended consequences it may have for American businesses, our friends, or our allies.\nDONALD J.

WALTERS: So I know you guys had so much fun yesterday with Stephen. Sorry to disappoint but today is not going to be nearly as lively as yesterday was.\nYesterday, we talked about the American Dream and how the President's immigration policies will help keep it alive for generations to come. Today I want to briefly talk about two other critical parts of his agenda: economic growth and keeping the promises we made to the American heroes.\nJust yesterday, the Dow soared to an all-time high of over 22,000 points. American businesses and consumers have great reason to be optimistic under President Trump. From an aggressive push for smarter regulation to renegotiating unfair trade deals, everything comes back to jobs for the President.\nThat's why we've added over 850,000 jobs since he took office. That's why consumer confidence is at an all-time high.\nAnd that's why major companies are announcing billions of dollars of investments here at home instead of overseas. And the President is bringing this same forward-looking vision to the care of the men and women who have risked their lives to protect our freedom.\nThis morning, as many of you saw, the President and VA Secretary Shulkin unveiled a suite of new telehealth options that will expand access to department medical care for tens of thousands of rural homebound veterans.\nLast year, 700,000 veterans got telehealth services through the VA. With the help of the innovations like Veterans Appointment Request, which allows veterans to schedule VA appointments on their smartphones, and a VA [Video] Connect, which allows VA providers to better connect with their patients, we hope to see that number continue to rise.\nFinally, this might be one of the last times we gather like this before the West Wing staff are temporarily relocated. I wanted to give you a little information update on the GSA renovations. Beginning tomorrow, Friday, all staff will be relocated to the EEOB to accommodate necessary renovations to the West Wing. These renovation plans had been approved by the previous administration, following the completion of the phase 1, but were never actually initiated.\nI know most of you have seen the ceiling issue we have in lower press, but to give you an idea of some of the other vital projects that need to be taken care of -- for example: The HVAC systems are 27 years old, but due to the 24/7, 365-day use a year, the estimated age of the system based off of usage is 81 years old. The South Portico steps on the South Lawn will also be repaired. They haven't been restored in 64 years.\nIn addition to these larger structural repairs, we will be renovating the Navy Mess kitchen, the West Wing lower lobby, and the IT system, and generic cosmetic upgrades.\nSo all of us in lower press will miss seeing you guys every day, but we're definitely looking forward to the much-needed renovations in the HVAC system, as well as throughout the rest of the West Wing.\nAnd with that, I will take your questions.\nQ: Where will the President be working during this time when everyone is evacuated from the West Wing?\nMS. WALTERS: The President tomorrow will be taking off for Bedminster for a working vacation. As I mentioned, with the HVAC system being replaced, that means that the West Wing will be without air conditioning for the next two weeks, which is why the staff and the President are moving out, because I don't think any of you would like to be in the West Wing in an August D.C. summer day when it's over 100 degrees with no air conditioning.\nQ: The President is going to West Virginia today. This is a campaign rally. But his opioid commission recommended declaring an emergency on the opioid crisis. Will he be making any announcements about that? Is he considering that recommendation?\nMS. WALTERS: I don't want to get ahead of what the President's announcement will be tonight. This week, the opioid commission did submit their interim report. As you know, this is an issue that is very important to the President -- something he discussed on the campaign trail and has continued throughout his administration to advocate for, as it's plaguing many of the states across our country.\nQ: I have a coal-mining question. As you know, the White House hasn't nominated a chief for the Mine Safety and Health Administration yet. Is there a timeline for that? Do you have plans in place for when to --\nMS. WALTERS: We don't have any personnel announcement at this time. When we do, you will all be notified.\nQ: Are there any concerns about pushing greater coal production and possibly easing regulations, and whether that could lead to an increase in the number of coal miners injured or killed?\nMS. WALTERS: The regulations that the President is doing are to help create jobs. He's not lowering any safety regulations. Safety is still a top priority, but as the President said, we need to create jobs, we need to bring jobs back to our shores, and send them to the people of West Virginia where coal mining is so prevalent.\nThese are important jobs that grow and boost their economy, and so nothing he is doing is cutting back on the safety -- safety is a top priority, but our main focus is on creating and growing jobs in these communities that rely on the coaling industry as a main source of income.\nQ: Did you -- apparent transcripts of the President's conversations with world leaders in January leaked today, including comments about the President to President Peña Nieto where he apparently said that building the wall on the southern border with Mexico was not a policy priority but only a political one. And then separately he had a conversation with Malcolm Turnbull -- it got heated at points, there seemed to be a bit of information -- sort of confusion between the President and Prime Minister Turnbull. Do you have any response to those revelations? And since the White House had denied some of those revelations when they were reported back three months ago, now here's the transcript proving that that conversation did in fact happen as reported back then.\nMS. WALTERS: I'm not going to comment on leaked calls. Obviously, as you said before, this is a national security matter when phone call transcripts are being leaked out. It prevents the President from being able to do what he does best and negotiate with foreign leaders.\nWhat I can tell you regarding the border wall is that the President spoke about this on the campaign, continues to echo it now, that having a secure border is prevalent to the safety of our country, and that that is something that he had promised his supporters and has continued to focus on is making sure that we have a secure border.\nQ: I'm going to follow up on that. The President's comments about the state of New Hampshire have been condemned now by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle from the Granite State. Does the President intend to apologize to the people of New Hampshire for his comments?\nMS. WALTERS: The President was referring to -- you know, he was talking about the opioid epidemic up there which has affected a lot of lives in New Hampshire. I can tell you that's an important focus of his. As we talked about earlier, the commission he formed -- you know, that is a focus and something that no person should deal with. You shouldn't be a mother or a father, or sister, or brother -- have to bury a loved one who has -- their life has been cost due to substance abuse.\nQ: He referred to it as a \"drug-infested den.\" People are feeling insulted by the way he characterized their state.\nMS. WALTERS: Again, this was a conversation that was leaked out. I'm not going to get into commenting on that conversation. I can just echo the fact that combatting the drug abuse and substance and opioid epidemic is important to the President.\nQ: So no apology?\nMS. WALTERS: I'm not going to comment any further.\nQ: Does he plan to act on the recommendations of the commission? You said that they put out a report, but what is he doing about it?\nMS. WALTERS: They put out the interim report earlier this week. Let me check back with you on what the next steps are regarding that report.\nQ: How did those conversations get out -- those transcripts get out? What stage are things at in terms of looking at how that happened?\nMS. WALTERS: Again, Roberta was asking how did the transcripts end up getting leaked to yourselves, and I'm not going to get into leaked conversations.\nWhat I can tell you is that it's damaging to our national security, and it's something that we take very seriously. You've heard this administration talk over and over again about the fact that we need to end these leaks, and that it's not beneficial to anyone to be having documents leaked out.\nQ: So is that being investigated then?\nMS. WALTERS: I'll look into that for you.\nQ: Do you have any update on that big announcement that the President was talking about? Can you give us some idea of what he was talking about?\nMS. WALTERS: If I did that, it wouldn't be the surprise he was talking about earlier. So unfortunately, you're going to have to wait. But we are landing shortly as you can hear the gears go down. So you'll know soon enough.\nWith that, I'll take one more question.\nQ: Do you have any comment on legislation that's afoot to sort of protect special counsel Mueller from being terminated?\nMS. WALTERS: Let me look into that. What I can tell you is I will refer to Ty Cobb, but I can get back to you on that.\nQ: Why is the President taking vacation if he said that Congress should stay in town and work in healthcare, and the President criticized President Obama for taking multiple vacations? So can you talk about why the President decided to take this vacation now?\nMS. WALTERS: The President is going to continue to work. We all need to be relocated out of the West Wing due to these renovations that should have taken place before. And we're at a position that we're now at a dire need, and they either need to be repaired or replaced. And it's not something that can go on while we're still occupying the West Wing. So the President will continue to work over the next two weeks.\nBut I'm going to let everyone sit down since we are landing and it's getting awfully turbulent. Thanks, guys.\nEND 6:00 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "The President spoke at 11:40 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. Secretary Shulkin referred to Denise Stevens, licensed nurse practitioner, Grants Pass Community Based Outpatient Clinic in Grants Pass, OR; Tracy G. Dekelboum, Chief of Telehealth Services, VA Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center and Clinics; and Physician to the President and Chief White House Physician Ronny L. Jackson.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=127990", "text": "The President. Good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking Secretary David Shulkin for the incredible progress that he's making at the VA, tremendous strides. Thank you very much, David. We appreciate it. The veterans appreciate it, I can tell you that.\nToday I'm pleased to announce another historic breakthrough that will expand VA services to many more patients and veterans. We will do this through telehealth services. It's what it's called: telehealth services.\nWe're expanding the ability of veterans to connect with their VA health care team from anywhere using mobile application on the veteran's own phone or the veteran's own computer. This will significantly expand access to care for our veterans, especially for those who need help in the area of mental health, which is a bigger and bigger request, and also in suicide prevention. It will make a tremendous difference for the veterans in rural locations in particular.\nWe're launching the mobile app that will allow VA patients to schedule and change their appointments at VA facilities using their smartphones. So this is something they were never able to do. Technology has given us this advantage, but unfortunately, we have not taken advantage of that until now.\nWe're working tirelessly to keep our promises to our great veterans. Very important in my campaign and on the campaign trail, the veterans mean so much to me and this administration. In the past 6 months, I have signed historic VA accountability legislation. I have signed legislation to extend and improve the Veterans Choice Program. We're starting to really get that to a point where choice is just becoming something that they are extremely happy about, and they've wanted it for many, many years.\nWe're working to enable seamless care between the Departments of Defense and Veteran Affairs. We have launched a groundbreaking new website that allows veterans to compare wait times and quality of care at VA facilities and other hospitals. So we're actually able to compete our facilities with other hospitals and other VA facilities. So we'll really strike a little competitive advantage and, I think, get people moving even better.\nAnd we have dramatically increased the number of approvals for veterans to see the doctors. So they are going to have many more doctors of their choice.\nThese accomplishments are only the beginning. We will not rest until all of America's great veterans can receive the care they so richly deserve. Tremendous progress has been made in a short period of time. We've only been here 6 months, but tremendous progress has been made.\nAnd I want to ask Dr. Shulkin, perhaps, to give us a little preview of what's to come. Thank you.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs David J. Shulkin. Well, Mr. President, thank you so much. What we're announcing today is a big deal for veterans. It's really going to expand access for veterans in a way we haven't done before. And as you may know, VA already has the largest telehealth program in the country. Last year, we had 700,000 veterans who got telehealth services through the VA, and we actually can do this for 50 different specialties. In fact, Mr. President, if you take a look at all those specialties on this chart, we can provide telehealth services from teledermatology to tele-intensive care to teledentistry. And this is the type of thing that is available now to our veterans.\nBut what we're announcing today dramatically expands our current capabilities. Mr. President, by working with the Office of American Innovation and the Department of Justice, we're going to be issuing a regulation that allows our VA providers to provide telehealth services from anywhere in the country to veterans anywhere in the country, whether it's in their homes or any location. We call it \"anywhere to anywhere\" VA health care. That's a big deal.\nNow, just think about this. That means we're going to be able to use VA providers in cities where there are a lot of doctors and be able to use those doctors to help our veterans in rural areas where there aren't many health care professionals. And you talked about mental health and suicide prevention; this is one of those areas that we can really use that expertise. And today's announcement is going to allow us to do that.\nWhat we're going to be rolling out nationally with a rollout across the country is what's called VA Video Connect. VA Video Connect allows VA providers to use mobile devices to connect with veterans on their mobile devices or their home computers. That's a big deal. Currently, we use VA Video Connect with over 300 VA providers at 67 of our hospitals or clinics across the country. But that's beginning to roll out nationally.\nAnd there's one more thing, Mr. President. We're going to be announcing a new technology called the Veterans Appointment Request. And what that is, is it's allowing the veteran, on their smartphone, to be able to schedule their appointments directly with VA providers or to change their appointments or cancel their appointments with VA providers. Now, today, this is available in all 18 of our regions across the country. And we've already booked more than 4,000 appointments from veterans directly from their smartphones so that they can schedule their own appointments.\nBut now we're announcing the national rollout of this. And if veterans want to see and get the Veterans Appointment Request, you can see on our website—mobile.va.gov/appstore—the VA app store has this available for download.\nSo, Mr. President, what we're really doing is, we're removing regulations that have prevented us from doing this. We're removing geography as a barrier so that we can speed up access to veterans and really honor our commitment to them.\nNow, let me show you how this works, Mr. President. If we come over here, we use technology in a way that's pretty incredible.\n[At this point, Secretary Shulkin led the President to a computer screen on which U.S. Coast Guard veteran Albie Amescua and three medical practitioners appeared via live video feed from the Department of Veterans Affairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic in Grants Pass, OR.]\nIn fact, Mr. President, I'm one of those doctors. I practice right here in Washington to my clinic in Grant Pass, Oregon. And I want to say hello to our veteran today. Mr. Amescua, how are you?\nGrants Pass, OR, resident Albie Amescua. Yes, sir. Good morning. Secretary Shulkin. Mr. Amescua is a veteran. He served in the Coast Guard for 26 years. He was a helicopter rescue swimmer and served the country. And here we are in Oregon. And this is our great team: Peggy and Denise and Terry. And, Peggy, would you mind—I understand there might be some area of concern on Mr. Amescua's skin. Can we take a look at that, please?\nPeggy Berg, registered nurse, Grants Pass Community Based Outpatient Clinic. Yes, sir. Dr. Shulkin, this is the area that is of concern.\n[A magnified image of Mr. Amescua's skin appeared on the screen.]\nSecretary Shulkin. Okay. And so as we focus in on that, you can see, Mr. President, I can take a look at that area and if I have any concern about it, we can send this to a specialist or we can take a look at it. But thank you.\nMr. Amescua, we'll be right back with you soon. I just want to show the President a few other things, but we'll be right back with you.\nMr. President, if you walk over here, this is actually the new doctor's bag, the doctor's bag of the future. And you may actually recognize this because this is the doctor's bag that travels with you when you go on Air Force One. And so we have Dr. Ronny Jackson, your doctor here that usually takes care of you, Dr. Jackson. And we now are able to bring this doctor's bag into the home of our veterans. Our nurse practitioners, our technicians are able to use this type of technology now, the same technology available to the President of the United States. And that's the way it should be, because our veterans deserve that type of technology.\nThe President. Great.\nSecretary Shulkin. Now, I'm going to show you just one or two other things. Dr. Neil Evans over here, one of our doctors, is going to show you VA Video Connect that I talked about. So here we are in Grant Pass, Oregon. Hi, Mr. Amescua, how are you? Can you raise your hand?\nMr. Amescua. Good morning, sir.\nSecretary Shulkin. Good. So here we are in Grant Pass, Oregon on our mobile device, and this is how we can use VA Video Connect. But watch this, Mr. President. If we need to bring in a specialist from anywhere in the country into Grants Pass, Oregon, we can. So Dr. Brook Watts. Do you want to say hello, Dr. Watts?\n[Dr. Brook Watts, an internist at Louis Stokes VA Medical Center, appeared on a mobile device held by Dr. Neil Evans, Chief Officer for the Office of Connected Care at the Veterans Health Administration.]\nDr. Watts. Good Morning, Dr. Shulkin. Good morning, Mr. President. And good morning, Mr. Amescua. Thank you so much for your service.\nThe President. Good morning.\nSecretary Shulkin. Dr. Watts is a specialist—an internal medicine specialist—in Cleveland, Oregon, and she is now connected in with Mr. Amescua in Grants Pass, Oregon. So we can get the expertise from anywhere in the country immediately. The VA is able to do this right now. So thank you. Thank you very much.\nAnd so, Mr. President, this is how we're expanding access. This is how we're bringing the very best technology available in the country. And really thanks to your help in cutting through the regulation, the Office of American Innovation, we're able to expand access dramatically today and to roll this out.\nAnd as you said, with our accountability bill, our replacing our electronic medical record, the progress we're making in 6 months, we've been able to do tremendous things. But it's just the beginning of what we're going to do for our veterans.\nSo thank you very much.\nThe President. Well, thank you very much. Well, thank you, Doctor. And I just want to thank him, and your skin—I hope you skin is going to be in perfect shape. [Laughter] You look pretty good to me. What do I know? [Laughter]\nSecretary Shulkin. Mr. Amescua, why don't you say something if you want to say hello to the President.\nMr. Amescua. Good morning, Mr. President, how are you?\nThe President. Very good. You look very healthy to me, I will tell you that. [Laughter] Please make sure his skin is perfect. [Laughter] Okay?\nThank you very much. Great technology. Great to meet you. Thank you.\nWe're going to West Virginia tonight, by the way. We're going to have a very big announcement, which will be very exciting, I think, for the media and everyone else. But we have a very big announcement tonight. I believe I'll be making it in West Virginia, so that will very exciting.\nThank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-08-03", "title": "Remarks on the Department of Veterans Affairs Telehealth Services Program"}

I am thrilled to be back in the very, very beautiful State of West Virginia, and I am proud to stand before you and celebrate the hard-working people who are the absolute backbone of America. Thank you. I love the people of this State, I love your grit, your spirit, and I love our coal miners, and they're coming back strong.\nI made you a promise during the campaign—you all remember; many of you were here. I actually think we have more people here tonight, with thousands outside, than we had during the campaign, if you can believe it. And as you've seen, I've kept that promise. As President, we are putting our coal miners back to work. We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal. We've stopped the EPA intrusion. American coal exports are already up. Think of this, think of this: American exports of coal are already up more than 60 percent this year. Did you ever hear of anything like that?\nThe change you voted for is happening every single day. Everyone in this great arena is united by shared values. We believe in God. We believe in family. We believe in country. We support the Constitution of the United States of America. We cherish and defend the Second Amendment. We believe schools should teach students to love our country, to have pride in our history, and to respect our great American flag.\nWe stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. Thank you. We believe strongly that a nation must defend and protect its borders. And above all else, we believe that we must take care of our own citizens and put America first.\nDay after day, we are keeping the promises that we made during the campaign, and that includes our promises to our great veterans. Thank you, veterans. Today we announced new telehealth services to help our veterans get the care they need, where and when they need it. Far advanced, and it is so popular. This State has many retired military members, and we thank them, and we thank their families and spouses for the patriotic service. They have been incredible. We, in America, honor our great heroes.\nThis week in the East Room of the White House, I awarded the Medal of Honor to a true American hero, Specialist 5 James C. McCloughan. Many of you watched as I gave Jim the medal. He courageously saved the lives of his fellow soldiers during a fierce 2-day battle in Vietnam. His story is now enshrined forever in the roll call of American patriots.\nEarlier this morning a former marine named Woody Williams led everyone here in the Pledge of Allegiance. Thank you, Woody.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. Woody received a Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman for his actions in Iwo Jima. Woody is the last surviving marine who received a Medal of Honor in World War II. Woody, tonight we honor you, we salute you, and we thank you for what you've done for all of us. Thank you, Woody.\nNow we must protect the birthright of freedom that patriots like Jim and Woody have earned for us with their blood, their sweat, their tears, their hard work, and their bravery. All across the country, Americans of every kind are coming together with one simple goal: make America great again.\nThe stock market reached yet another alltime—in history—alltime high today, boosting the retirement savings, hopefully, of everybody in this room. Have you all been helped? I think so. Unemployment is at a 16-year low. But don't forget—and I will never forget—the millions and millions of people out there that want jobs that don't register on the unemployment rolls because they gave up looking for jobs. So I accept the number, but honestly, we all know there are millions of people out there that we love—they're forgotten men and women—and they're looking for jobs, and they're going to have them, because I have factories coming back into this country. You've seen that. They're coming back. We have auto plants expanding and coming back. They're coming into Michigan. They're really coming into Michigan. And they're coming into Ohio and Pennsylvania.\nAudience members. Trump! Trump! Trump!\nThe President. Economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent nationwide. You have to understand what that means. Nobody thought that number was going to happen. And it's 3-percent growth in West Virginia. I wonder how that happened, 3-percent growth. West Virginia, you're leading the average. When was the last time you heard that, West Virginia? You're leading the country's average.\nRemember I told you, don't sell your homes, don't sell your homes. You're doing great. I'm so proud of you. You know, we won this State by 42 points. Can you believe that? Forty-two points. And I asked your Republican Party leader, how would we be doing today versus November 8, election day? He said, \"Mr. President, honestly, you're doing better.\" I said, better? That's great. Forty-two points.\nSince our election—not mine—since our election, we've added more than 1 million new jobs. And the good news keeps pouring in. In fact, we have a very important announcement to make tonight. Does anybody know what that announcement is? Huh? Does anybody know what that announcement is? We have a very, very large announcement. Do you understand? Large.\nSo I would like to invite my good friend, and your Governor, Jim Justice, up to the stage to share this news with all of you. Jim, come on up. Come on up, Jim. Look at this guy. Jim is going to say a few words. And these words have not been spoken by a major political figure—meaning Governor or Senator—in our country for a long time. Thank you.\nAudience members. Trump! Trump! Trump!\nGovernor James C. Justice II of West Virginia. First of all, what an incredible honor, and thank you for coming, and thank our great President for being here.\nI've got to tell you a couple stories real quick. I've been to the Oval Office twice in the last 2 or 3 weeks. I've been there to present an idea on coal and an idea on manufacturing. I've had the great opportunity to be with our President.\nAudience members. Boo!\nGov. Justice. Now, let me tell you just this: I have to be really serious with you just a moment. I have to tell you that the last session of our Legislature, I tried with all my soul. Now, I can tell you, if you'll just give me just a moment. This man and myself are not politicians. We ran to get something done. We ran and gave up part of our lives. We ran because we want nothing. We ran as our Founding Fathers did years and years ago: to serve.\nNow, I will promise you to my soul that no one loves West Virginia more than I. And in the last session, I would tell you that there was some greatness passed with our roads and so on, but there was way too much pain. Now, listen to me, and listen really good. We hurt a lot of people. We hurt our vets and our teachers and our disabled and our weak, and we walked away from the old. Now, I can promise you just this: I came to only get something done.\nLet me just say this to you as bluntly as I can say it: West Virginia, at the altar, when we had it done, like it or not like it, but the Democrats walked away from me. Now, today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking—today I will tell you as West Virginians—I can't help you anymore being a Democrat Governor. So tomorrow I will be changing my registration to Republican. As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play. I would also tell you this—and pay, please, close attention to this—my mom and dad were staunch lovers of Ronald Reagan, staunch Republicans. My mom and dad are, no question in my mind, in Heaven right now, and they're both saying the same thing—but my mom is saying it more profoundly—and that is, she's saying, \"Jimmy, it's about damn time you came to your senses.\"\nNow, let me go one step further and say just this: What in the world is wrong with us as peoples? Have we not heard enough about the Russians? I mean, to our God in heaven above, think about it, the stock market is at 22,000, and this country has hope. And we're on our way. Now, this man is a really dear friend of mine. But you know what else is unbelievable? This man now has a Chief of Staff that all of us can pronounce his first name. And you know what that name is today? It's \"sir.\" Think about that.\nNow, I'll end by saying, we're a long ways from being perfect. There's mistakes made, and change is tough, but I can tell you this: This man is a reflection of his kids, his children. Eric Trump has been under my vehicle in the back of the woods changing a tire. [Laughter] I've hunted with Don Jr. And Ivanka and Jared, even though Jared is a great son-in-law, are so good it's off the chart.\nNow, I'll end by saying very quickly: This man is a good man. He's got a backbone. He's got real ideas. He cares about America. He cares about us in West Virginia. And most importantly of all, you know what? He has made us as common, everyday Americans feel good and be proud of who we are. My friend, our great President, Donald J. Trump.\nAudience members. Trump! Trump! Trump!\nThe President. I want to thank your great Governor. Having big Jim as a Republican is such an honor, I will tell you. Such an honor. He's a fantastic man, a fantastic guy. And thank you, Jim, very much. All over the Nation they're watching, and they really appreciate that.\nAnd we have another friend with us tonight who voted for us on health care. And honestly, how the Republicans and the Democrats let us down on that is hard to believe. Repeal and replace. Hard to believe.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Hard to believe. Senators. But a Senator that voted for it, Shelley Moore Capito, who is here with us tonight. Thank you, Shelley. Jim came to the Oval Office a couple of weeks ago, and we talked about how we are all working together to open up the coal mines in this State, and also, very importantly, to create jobs in furniture manufacturing and other forms of manufacturing. Very important to Jim.\nBut Governor Justice did something else very important tonight. He showed the country that our agenda rises above left or right. It's an agenda for all of the people, especially for the tens of millions of forgotten Americans. They're not so forgotten anymore, I will tell you. You proved that. You proved it. They're not forgotten anymore. Countless citizens—Democrat, Republican, Independent—have been neglected and ignored by Washington, but we will make sure they are never ignored again.\nWe know there are powerful forces in Washington who want to stop us, but we won't let them. We are fighting for every American who's been overlooked, pushed aside, or told to put their dreams on hold. But we will win, and we're winning now.\nThe failed voices in Washington who oppose our movement are the exact same people who gave us one terrible trade deal after another, who gave us one foreign policy disaster after another, and who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, and our jobs. They gave them away.\nWe don't need advice from the Washington swamp. We need to drain the swamp.\nAudience members. Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!\nThe President. Washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves. But you know this; you know it better than most: I didn't come to Washington for me, I came to Washington for all of you. That I can tell you. Your dreams are my dreams, your hopes are my hopes, and your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day.\nThe question for Democrats—all Democrats, including those in Congress—is whether they are on the side of the voters or are they on the side of the special interests. The reason why Democrats only talk about the totally made-up Russia story is because they have no message, no agenda, and no vision.\nThey don't talk about the alltime high stock market. They don't talk about reforms to the VA or about manufacturing jobs we're bringing back to America by the hundreds of thousands. They don't talk about the Keystone Pipeline that I immediately approved or the Dakota Access Pipeline.\nThe Russia story is a total fabrication. It's just an excuse for the greatest loss in the history of American politics. That's all it is. It just makes them feel better when they have nothing else to talk about. What the prosecutors should be looking at are Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted e-mails.\nAudience members. Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\nThe President. And they should be looking at the paid Russian speeches and the owned Russian companies. Or let them look at the uranium she sold that is now in the hands of very angry Russians.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign. There never were. We didn't win because of Russia. We won because of you, that I can tell you. We won because we totally outworked the other side. We won because millions of patriotic Americans voted to take back their country. Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania? Are there any Russians here tonight? Any Russians?\nThey can't beat us at the voting booths, so they're trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want. They're trying to cheat you out of the leadership you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us and, most importantly, demeaning to our country and demeaning to our Constitution.\nI just hope the final determination is a truly honest one, which is what the millions of people who gave us our big win in November deserve and what all Americans who want a better future want and deserve. Democrat lawmakers will have to decide. They can continue their obsession with the Russian hoax, or they can serve the interests of the American people. Try winning at the voter booth. Try winning at the voter booth. Not going to be easy, but that's the way you're supposed to do it.\nOur agenda is the pro-worker agenda. We want to control our borders and lift our people from welfare to work. We want to support our police and make our communities safe. We want to reduce taxes and increase wages for all of our people. We want to get the special interests out of politics for good. And we want to bring back our plants and our factories and our manufacturing, and that's what happening right now, and you see it, and so does every other State in our Union.\nThat is why, in the proud tradition of America's great leaders—from Washington to Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt—we are protecting American workers, and we are protecting American industry for the first time in many, many decades.\nNo longer will we allow other countries to close our factories, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth. We are building our future with American hands, American labor, and American iron, aluminum, steel, and what else? Coal. We will buy American, and we will hire American.\nTo protect our jobs and our industry, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership. And to protect our workers and our coal miners, I also withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris climate accord.\nBut not only are we bringing back our jobs, we are bringing back our safety. We have seen the bloodshed and devastation inflicted by terrorists in America, in Europe, and all across the world. I said it during the campaign, and I will say it again right here tonight: We will keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. We only want to admit people into our country who love our people and who share our values.\nWe're also keeping our country safe from criminal gangs and violent crime. We are taking the fight to the drug smugglers, human traffickers, and the vile criminal cartels like MS-13 who are being thrown out of our country so quickly you can't even count.\nJust last week, I visited Long Island, where MS-13 has brought terrible violence to a once-peaceful and beautiful neighborhood, right where I grew up. We are liberating American communities from these vicious, violent gangs. One by one, we are finding the drug dealers, the gang members, the predators, thieves, criminals, and killers, and we are throwing them out of our country. And once they are gone, we will not let them back in. We are stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and you have a big problem in West Virginia, and we are going to solve that problem. We are cracking down strongly on sanctuary cities that shield criminal aliens. And in order to stop the drugs, gangs, and traffickers, we are building a wall on the southern border.\nAudience members. Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!\nThe President. I also proudly announced legislation this week with Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue to reform our immigration system to protect American workers and American taxpayers. It's called the RAISE Act—R-A-I-S-E—the RAISE Act.\nFor many years, America has issued most of its green cards to lower skilled immigrants and people that had no hope of getting a job, undermining blue-collar workers and wages, and costing taxpayers billions and billions of dollars a year. The RAISE Act switches to a merit-based system. You come in largely based on merit. Doesn't that sound nice? Wouldn't that be nice? It's about time.\nOur proposal prevents new immigrants from going on welfare for at least 5 years. So you don't come in and go on welfare. Our plan favors applicants who can speak English, who can support themselves financially, and who demonstrate valuable skills that will strengthen our economy and strengthen our country.\nWe believe decisions about who immigrates to our country should be based on the best interests of America and on the best interests of the American people, you. We are working every single day to heed and honor the will of those millions and millions of voters that came out and voted for us. Not for me, they voted for us. That is why I will repeat again tonight that Congress must do its job, keep its promise, live up to its word, and repeal and replace Obamacare. You have to do it.\nNothing in life is easy, but Congress must not give in. They must not give up. But instead, Congress must get to work and deliver Americans the great health care that they deserve, the great repeal and replace that they've been talking about for 7 years. Incredible. One vote. Incredible. But we'll get it. We'll get it, folks. They can't give up. Call your Congressmen, call your Senators, call everybody. Get them to have the guts to vote to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a disaster.\nTo be a prosperous nation it is also critical that we lower the crushing tax burden on our workers and on our businesses. The United States has the highest tax rate on business anywhere in the world, and we want to bring it down to one of the lowest, because we want more growth, more jobs, and higher pay, and that's what's going to happen. And importantly, we also want to let Americans keep more of their own money, not take it from them. It's time to pass a tax cut for middle class families. Finally—and you'll see very soon, but you're hearing about it—my administration is committed to rebuilding the depleted infrastructure of the United States.\nThink of it: We've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, and the Middle East is a hundred times worse than it was 16 years ago when we started. Can you believe this? What a shame. That is why we are pushing a $1 trillion new infrastructure investment bill. We're going to fix our roads. We're going to fix our bridges. We're going to fix our highways and our schools and our airports. We will create amazing monuments that inspire awe and wonder in our people. It used to be that way. It's not that way any longer. We have airports that look like third world countries. It's not going to be that way anymore.\nAmerican workers will build this great future, and American energy and American clean coal will power this future. We are the nation that put a man on the Moon, that dug out the Panama Canal, and that won two World Wars. We can do anything, we can build anything, and we can dream anything.\nWe share one home and one glorious destiny. And whether we are Black or Brown or White, we all bleed the same red blood, we all salute that same great American flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. As long as we remember these truths, as long as we remember who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never fail. America will triumph, freedom will prevail, our values will endure, our citizens will prosper, and our Nation will thrive as never before.\nWith patriotism in our souls, and with love for West Virginia in our hearts, we say these words again tonight: We will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.\nThank you, West Virginia. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-08-03", "title": "Remarks at a \"Make America Great Again\" Rally in Huntington, West Virginia"}

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128002", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome. And thank you to my friend Frank Donatelli for that overly generous introduction.\nFrank knows me well enough to know the introduction I prefer is just a little bit shorter. I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican -- in that order. (Applause.)\nAnd I's a great honor to be here tonight to address the rising generation of conservative leaders, the men and women of Young America's Foundation, here at the 39th National Conservative Student Conference. Give yourselves a round of applause. You're going to be making a difference in America for a long time. (Applause.)\nSo welcome back to Washington, D.C. Before I get started, I bring greetings this evening from a friend of mine, a man who's fighting every day for common-sense, conservative values -- from the very heart of the White House in the Oval Office, I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America -- President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nThanks to the support of so many young conservatives like all of you here today all across this country, last November President Trump won a historic victory. More counties than any President since Ronald Reagan -- 30 of 50 states, states no Republican had carried in a generation. The truth is with your support, President Donald Trump turned the blue wall red. (Applause.)\nAnd I came here tonight just to pay a debt of gratitude to all of you who helped elect a President who is fighting every day, fighting every day for the values and the ideals that unite us, and fighting every day to keep the promises that he made to the American people.\nAnd for my part, it's a privilege to be back at the Young America's Foundation. I've worked hand-in-hand with YAF going back more than 15 years -- not from when that picture was taken. (Laughter.) But from when I first arrived in Congress in 2001. In 2005, my family had the great privilege to visit the Reagan Ranch, where YAF has wonderfully preserved the wisdom and legacy of my second favorite President of the United States, President Ronald Reagan. (Applause.)\nI have to tell you as I ran into Ron and Frank backstage, thinking of all the years that we've stood together and all the encouragement they've been to me as a conservative, I just can't tell you how genuinely humbling it is for me to think that I'm standing before you today because of their encouragement, and support and because of folks like you all over this country, and because of the confidence and generosity of our new President that I stand before you today as the 48th Vice President of the United States of America. So on behalf of my family, thank you for the opportunity to serve. (Applause.)\nIt's remarkable to think about the Young America's Foundation's history and contributions not just to my small life but to the conservative movement itself and to this entire country.\nSince its founding in 1960, YAF has been a bulwark of American greatness. You fight for the truths of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. You fight for those timeless principles of \"individual freedom, a strong national defense, free enterprise, and traditional moral values\". And let there be no doubt because of the work of all of you all across this country, conservative values are winning on campuses and winning the hearts and minds of America one student at a time. (Applause.)\nToday, YAF has more than 300 chapters that are active on over 2,000 campuses all across the United States, reaching a stunning 400,000 students every year.\nYou run so many noteworthy projects and programs, but I'd especially like to thank you particularly for your heroic work promoting and standing for freedom of expression and the free exchange of ideas on the campuses across this country. (Applause.)\nAs I said in an address I gave at the University of Notre Dame just a few months ago, we live in a time when free speech and civility are waning on campuses across America, but YAF is committed to change that. And you're making a great difference.\nYou've speaking out against speech codes, safe spaces, political correctness. You fight to defend conservative speakers and students who want nothing more than to exercise their First Amendment right to the freedom of speech.\nAnd so tonight, I just want to say thank you. Thank you to the young men and women of Young America's Foundation for your strong stand for our freedoms, and thank you for all that you do, day-in and day-out to bring the conservative message to the public square. (Applause.)\nAnd I can promise you as you labor, I see it every day, the Young America's Foundation finally has a friend back in the Oval Office in the White House. (Applause.)\nPresident Donald Trump has been fighting every day for the conservative vision, the conservative values that you and I hold dear.\nPresident Trump has given voice I believe to the aspirations and frustrations of the American people like no leader since President Ronald Reagan.\nAnd our President has gone right to work putting men and women into a Cabinet and into this administration that have been advancing that agenda with consistency and with courage.\nI got to tell you I think President Donald Trump has assembled the strongest conservative Cabinet in my lifetime -- bar none. (Applause.) Think about it. How about Ambassador Nikki Haley to the United Nations? (Applause.) How about Dr. Ben Carson at Housing and Urban Development? (Applause.) In fact, I know you're going to hear from Dr. Carson tonight, and he's just an incredible member of this Cabinet -- right along with others like Secretary of Defense Jim \"Mad Dog\" Mattis. (Applause.)\nYou go around that table and people like Betsy DeVos and others, truly it speaks volumes about this President's commitment to surrounding himself with extraordinary men and women as a part of this administration's team, and I couldn't be more proud to be a small part of it.\nSo as I stand before you today, I'm deeply humbled to be able to report to you that not just in assembling this team, but since day one of this administration, this President has been putting conservative principles into practice to strengthen America at home and abroad so that your generation can live in a country that is prosperous, safe, and free and is built on the highest ideals of the American experience. (Applause.)\nJust look at what our President has done to get the American economy moving again already. President Trump I'm pleased to report has actually signed more laws cutting through federal red tape than any President in American history. (Applause.) This President has been unleashing American energy after years of frustration by a liberal administration like when he authorized the construction of the Keystone and Dakota pipelines. (Applause.) And begun to roll back the Clean Power Plan. The truth is under President Donald Trump, the war on coal is over. (Applause.)\nAnd this President has been putting America first, like when he announced that the United States of America officially today notified the United Nations that we are withdrawing from the Paris climate accord. (Applause.)\nIn a word, President Trump been keeping his promise to make America prosperous again. Just this morning, the news came in -- did you hear about it? Over 1 million new jobs have been created across this country by businesses large and small since President Donald Trump took office. More Americans working than ever before, and unemployment hasn't been this low in 16 years. And as the President tweeted this morning, we \"have only just begun\"! (Applause.)\nBut as important as our prosperity is, this President knows that security is the foundation of our prosperity. And serving with him every day, I can assure you, President Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people.\nOur President has travelled across the wider world, reaffirming our historic alliances, challenging all who cherish freedom to step up and confront the forces that threaten our way of life. President Trump I'm pleased to report -- once again, we have a President who stands without apology on the world stage as leader of the free world. (Applause.)\nAnd I have to tell you more personal to me, as the proud father of a United States Marine, I couldn't be more grateful to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, their families, and our veterans. (Applause.)\nThe United States of America simply has the finest armed forces in the history of the world. The men and women who wear the uniform of this country are the best of your generation, and I'm inspired whenever I'm among them. Today, at Dover Air Force Base two heroes of this generation came home. Sergeant Jonathon Hunter and Specialist Christopher Harris of the 82nd Airborne. These two heroes fell defending our freedom in Afghanistan this week. We honor their service and their sacrifice. Their names will be enshrined in the hearts of a grateful nation, and their families and their loved ones will remain our prayers. For no greater love has a man than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends. These two men were heroes. We honor them tonight by standing with all those who at this very hour stand a far distant post on the ramparts of freedom. God bless them all. (Applause.)\nAnd we honor them through our tributes, but we also honor them through our actions. And I'll make you a promise: President Donald Trump is going to be the best friend the Armed Forces of the United States will have ever had in the White House. (Applause.)\nYou think about it, our President has already signed the largest increase in military spending in nearly 10 years. And he's called on the Congress to pass one of the biggest investments in our defense spending since the days of the Cold War.\nAnd under President Donald Trump, I'll make you a promise: We're going to rebuild our military, we're going to restore the arsenal of democracy, and we are once again going to give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and training they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. (Applause.)\nWith the leadership of this Commander-in-Chief, I'm proud to report our armed forces are taking the fight to our enemy on our terms, on their soil. And with President Donald Trump and our brave warriors in the field in Iraq and in Syrian, we will not rest, we will not relent until we hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source, so it can no longer threaten our homeland or threaten our allies around the world. (Applause.)\nAnd when it comes to security at home, our President has been busy as well -- securing our borders, enforcing our laws, removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from our streets, gang members, drug dealers, and violent criminal gangs like MS-13. And I'm pleased to report under President Donald Trump's leadership and the efforts of our Homeland Security, illegal immigrant crossings on our southern border are down more than 60 percent since the first day of 2017. (Applause.)\nSo President Trump is keeping his promise to make America safe again, and I couldn't be more grateful to serve with him.\nBut frankly, let me say from my heart how meaningful it is to me to serve with a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of life. (Applause.)\nIn one of his very first acts in office, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy to keep taxpayer funding out of organizations that perform and promote abortions abroad, and our President has expanded that policy to cover nearly $9 billion in foreign aid. (Applause.)\nAnd President Trump has empowered states to withhold federal funding from abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, and I'm humbled to say that at the President's direction, I was able to cast the tie-breaking vote in Senate to allow states to defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.)\nSo this President has been standing for the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution. And he's been making sure that his appointments to courts of this land will adhere to the Constitution as it's written, to strictly construe the Constitution. The men and women that we're putting forward to fill our federal benches are going to be people that uphold our highest traditions, like the newest member of Supreme Court of the United States -- Justice Neil Gorsuch. (Applause.)\nSo it's about jobs and prosperity. It's about security at home and abroad. It's our fundamental liberties, and it's strengthening America each and every day. President Trump has done all that and more, and it's been only a little more than six months.\nBut as the President likes to say, at this White House, that's just what we call a good start. (Applause.)\nThe truth is we got a lot more work to do. My fellow conservatives, let me assure you: Job one for this administration going forward is we're going to fight every day to keep the promise we made, and we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.)\nLast week, it was clear that the Senate wasn't quite ready to keep that promise to the American people, when they fell one vote short of moving forward on a bill to repeal and replace this disastrous policy.\nThe truth is every day Obamacare survives is another day the American people struggle. When Obamacare passed, we heard a lot of promises. You remember? We heard if you like your doctor, you can keep it -- not true. We heard if you like your health insurance, can you keep it -- not true. We heard that the cost of health insurance was going to go down. That one sure wasn't true. In fact, we were promised that families would save up to $2,500 in health insurance premiums if this thing became law about seven years ago. And the truth is the average Obamacare plan today costs nearly $3,000 more than a plan did in 2013.\nAnd while premiums are soaring, choices are plummeting. Next year, at least 40 percent of American counties, including nine whole states, will have only one choice of a health insurance provider, meaning they'll essentially have no choice at all.\nEven worse, many counties will have no health insurance providers whatsoever in 2018 all across this country. And it's not just about the statistics. It's about real people. It's about small business owners, family farmers all across this country that are struggling to make ends meet.\nBehind every number is a name, behind every name is a story. And I've heard these stories as I've traveled across America, and so has the President. Small businesses that talk about the heartache of struggling to keep their whole workforce in place, people that have worked for them for years and years. But with skyrocketing costs of health insurance, they got to choose between keeping the business going and keeping people on the payroll that they've known for years and years.\nI've talked to working families -- literally a woman in Wisconsin told me that she had to take a pass on paying her health insurance premium for three months just so she'd have enough money to buy Christmas presents for her grandkids.\nWe all know the truth, America knows the truth: Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go. (Applause.)\nNow, the President and I were disappointed when the Senate came up short in finishing what the House of Representatives had started. In fact, the President said, every single one of those Democrats in the Senate and just a couple -- handful of Republicans in his words \"let the American people down\". And that's the truth of it.\nBut my fellow conservatives, let me be clear: This ain't over, this ain't by a long shot. (Applause.)\nAnd President Trump -- are absolutely committed to keep our promise to the American people. We were not elected to save Obamacare; we were elected to repeal and replace it. And you can know with confidence that President Donald Trump and I are going to fight every day until we end the Obamacare nightmare once and for all. (Applause.)\nAnd when that day comes -- and rest assured, it will come -- we will begin to restore a healthcare system based on those timeless American principles of personal responsibility, free-market competition, and state-based reform. That's the conservative way to meet the needs of this country in the 21st century when it comes to healthcare, and that is the American way to improve 21st century healthcare for this generation and the next. (Applause.)\nAnd while we're working with this Congress to act on healthcare, I'll make you another promise: President Donald Trump and I are going to roll our sleeves up, sit down with lawmakers, and we're going to pass the largest tax cut since the days of Ronald Reagan. (Applause.) We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms.\nAnd President Trump is going cut business taxes in America so American companies can compete with companies around the world to create good-paying jobs right here in gold old USA. (Applause.)\nSo it's about healthcare. It's about tax cuts. And under this President's leadership, and with the support of this Congress, we're going to keep rolling forward. We'll make those historic investments in national defense to make America stronger and safer than ever before.\nWe'll keep reining in those unelected bureaucrats so they can't cripple our economy from the comfort of those taxpayer-funded metal desks.\nWe'll enact real education reform to give families more choices and make it possible for every child to be able to go to the school of their choice and have access to the world-class education every child deserves. It's a lot of work to do.\nBut I know I'm looking at a lot of young people that are anxious to get to it. So to this rising generation of conservative leaders, I'll tell you -- you picked a great time to show up. (Applause.) Because this the moment, now is the time.\nTo finish what we've started, though, the President and I are counting on all of you. We're counting on this rising generation. We need your voices. We need your values. We need your energy and your vision as never before.\nAs this rising generation of American leaders, you know that your future, the future of this country depends on what we do in the days ahead. No one has more stake in it than you.\nIt was President Reagan who memorably said, \"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction,\" and this rings just as true today as it did a half century ago when he said it.\nSo I came here to night really to encourage you to keep standing up. Keep speaking out. Let your voices heard. With your peers and your colleagues, go out there and keep advocating without apology and with cheerfulness the common-sense conservative message that this country longs to hear.\nAnd from this day forward, the President and I are going to have to count on every ounce of your energy. Your enthusiasm, your courage, your conviction, and your passion. And I know we'll have it.\nBut there's one more thing I might ask of you if you're so inclined. This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation -- widening and unknowable threats around the world, too much division here at home, an economy that's now beginning to get on its feet after years of struggling under the weight of big government. And I would just say as you leave here from this great conference energized, hearing all these speakers that you heard this week, you go back to your homes and go back to your schools renewed in your determination to make a difference for conservative values, I'd encourage you if you're inclined to bow the head and bend the knee, it would be a good time to do that, too.\nThe truth is it's a good time to pray for America because America matters far beyond our shores.\nAnd when I tell you to pray for America, I'm not so much talking about an agenda or a party, but really just pray for this country. Abraham Lincoln I thought had it pretty right. He was asked in his time if he thought God was on his side, and he said, I'd rather concern myself more with whether we're on God's side than whether God is our side.\nSo just pray for this country. Pray for all who serve her in every capacity because I truly do believe those ancient words of millennia ago are as true today as they've ever been, words that Americans have clung to in much more challenging times than these, that if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, he'll hear from Heaven, and he'll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: So in a word, men and women of the Young America's Foundation, have faith. Have faith in the principles that you hold in your hearts that brought you to this place today. Have faith in each other, and in your fellow conservatives, the ability to make a difference as conservatives have ever since this movement was born. Have faith in this President, who I promise you and the whole team is fighting for you every. And above all else, have a boundless faith in the American people, and in Him who placed this miracle of democracy on this wilderness shores, that He will still do as He's always done, He will bless America.\nAnd so I say to this rising generation, with your support, with the leadership that we have in President Donald Trump and in our majorities in the House and Senate and all across this land, and with all of your shining faces, I'm confident, together, we will make America safe again. Together, we will make America prosperous again. And together, to borrow a phrase, we will Make America Great Again.\nThank you very much. God bless the Young America's Foundation and God bless the United States of America.

This week, the Dow Jones industrial average reached an alltime high. Never ever has it been so high. In May, the unemployment rate hit a 16-year low, and last quarter, real GDP growth increased to 2.6 percent. Prosperity is coming back to our shores because we are putting American workers and families first.\nThe American dream has always been about doing what we love and doing it for the people we love. Whether serving in the Armed Forces, manufacturing goods, or starting a small business, our citizens pursue their aspirations and improve their lives of millions in countless, countless ways.\nYet, for too long, the dreams of many Americans have been put out of reach by Washington. Washington funded one global project after another while allowing other countries to drain our jobs and drain the wealth of the United States of America. Then, Washington taxed and regulated our own workers and industries, taking away their ability to earn a living.\nBut those days are over. My administration is working tirelessly on behalf of the American people. We have removed regulations and targeted unfair trade practices that are hurting Americans all over the world. We're ending the war on coal and unleashing American energy. We are introducing a tax plan to grow our economy and create more jobs. Factories and plants are coming back into Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and many other States. They are coming back instead of leaving like they have been for decades. And just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based green card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy. As an example, you cannot get welfare for 5 years when you come into our country. You can't just come in—like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in—immediately start picking up welfare. For 5 years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.\nAs I said in my address to Congress, the time for dreaming big, bold, and daring things for our country has begun. When Americans are free to pursue their dreams, there is no limit to what we can achieve. This is truly an exciting time in our country. Every day, we are accomplishing great things for our people.\nThank you, God bless you, God bless the United States. We're really moving along. We're bringing back our jobs. We're making America great again. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-08-04", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=127989", "text": "Marriott Bridgewater\n4:40 P.M. EDT\nSECRETARY PRICE: Good afternoon. We just have come from an extremely productive meeting with the President and the First Lady gathered to talk about the opioid crisis. The President and the First Lady are absolutely fully engaged on a tragedy that is crossing the country.\nThe President understands the magnitude of this challenge, how devastating it is, how it's devastated individuals and families and communities large and small. He understands the effect that it has had on our nation, especially on families and on children.\nThe numbers are absolutely daunting -- 52,000 overdose deaths in 2015; 33,000 of those approximately related to opioids. The numbers in 2016 are no better, and the numbers in 2017 are even worse than 2016.\nSo we briefed the President on our strategy through Health and Human Services Department, a strategy that includes making certain that we have the resources and the information necessary for prevention and treatment and recovery; providing best practices for states and those that are engaged in that process; making certain that we have overdose reversing medication -- naloxone and Narcan -- as present as needed and possible anywhere across the country; making certain that we're doing the data -- identifying the data, the public health aspect of it -- of this: Why is it that 52,000 Americans succumbed to an overdose death in 2015 and those numbers continue to increase? Fourth is the research aspect of this. What is the NIH doing? What can they do? And of exciting things to provide for, hopefully, pain medication that is not addictive or is not euphoric.\nOne of the exciting things that they're actually working on is a vaccine for addiction, which is an incredibly exciting prospect.\nAnd then, finally, how do we treat pain in this nation? As a formerly practicing physician -- orthopedic surgeon -- I know that physicians and other providers have oftentimes sensed that there is an incentive to provide narcotic medication. And we need to do all that we can to make certain that, yes, people are provided appropriate narcotic medication when necessary, but no more than necessary.\nWe wanted to make certain that the President understood that it was his entire Cabinet and the federal government that were involved in this process. This is an interdepartmental, interagency process that's moving forward.\nWe've met previously with the Department of State, Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, ONDCP, and others to make certain that we're working together on a comprehensive strategy that we're in the midst of right now and that we will be presenting to the President in the near future.\nAt the end of all of that, the President made certain that we understood that he was absolutely committed to making certain that we turn this scourge in the right direction, turn this tide in the right direction; make certain that we see the number of overdose deaths and the number of individuals addicted to medication decreased.\nAnd he has made certain that we understand and appreciate that this is an absolute priority of his administration, as it has been from day one.\nOne of the things that we've done to try to bring a voice to it and bring faces to it is to go around the country in multiple states and to visit communities and try to find those best practices -- what's working out there? What hasn't worked? Talk with those families that have been devastated by the addiction crisis; talk with folks who've been addicts and have recovered. What is it that worked? And it's so uplifting and inspiring to hear the stories of many of those individuals.\nOne of the President's senior counselors, Kellyanne Conway, has accompanied me on many of those trips, and she was at our meeting today, and I know that she wants to say a few words, as well.\nKellyanne.\nMS. CONWAY: Thank you, Secretary Price. And it's very nice to have the acting Director of ONDCP Richard Baum with us today, as well.\nThe Secretary and I have traveled to a number of different states, and we have heard the harrowing and very sad stories, but we also have increasingly met those who have successfully gone through treatment and recovery.\nWe're very heartened to learn many people who are beating opioid epidemic, and we recognize this is a polydrug problem in our nation, that we are a nation that consumes legal and illegal drugs at a very high and alarming rate.\nThe problem is very complicated, and currently we're on the losing side of this war. With the President's leadership and the First Lady's involvement across a spectrum of different cabinets and agencies and different departments within the West Wing, we are confident that we can help those in need across this country.\nWe know that this involves public health, the medical community, healthcare delivery system, law enforcement, education, local and statewide elected officials, devastated families, and those in treatment and recovery. We have presidential imprimatur leadership on this issue, but we full-on know that most of the great work is being done at the state and local levels. Those who are closest to those in need know best how to help them.\nWe didn't get here overnight, and we know that we can't solve the crisis overnight either. That said, I'd like to bring attention to some other areas with respect to the opioid and drug epidemic that sometimes go uncovered.\nWith a 52.7 percent increase in outpatient veterans treated for substance abuse disorders from 1995 to 2013, it's an increasing concern that addiction is plaguing our veteran community, as well. And we're working with Secretary Shulkin on that.\nThe next generation of the crisis is being seen in the number of newborns that are born addicted to opioids and other drugs. In fact, in this country, now NIH estimates that every 25 minutes a newborn is born addicted to opioids.\nWe are working hard to also stop the import of fentanyl into this country and to work with those governors and health commissioners and others within the states who are interested in reducing the number of pills and days in a prescription and also in working with the curriculum so that our medical professionals are more educated and more conversant with and versed in prescribing methodologies, as well.\nPresident Trump and the administration are working tirelessly toward this, and I would just say that having traveled this country and studied this issue very closely, no state has been spared, and no demographic group has gone untouched. This is not a problem of young or old, of black or white, of rural, urban, or suburban. It really has affected all of our communities in varying degrees.\nIt is also a nonpartisan issue in search of bipartisan support and bipartisan solutions, and we do hope that those in a position to help with the decision-making and advocacy and solutions, and those charged with covering this issue, as well, will agree that it is nonpartisan in search of bipartisan solutions.\nThank you very much.\nSECRETARY PRICE: Happy to take a question or two. Yes.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, a couple of questions. Several attorneys general, including some Republicans, have said manufacturers of opioids should be sued and are culpable, or should be legally culpable for parts of this crisis. Do you agree with that? What's the administration's orientation to those laws?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, there are a couple suits that are out there right now that have already begun. I think that this gives voice and punctuates the damage and the harm that people have felt because of this crisis. There isn't a position that the administration has on these suits at this point. But it has clearly gotten the attention of the pharmaceutical companies. Some have analogized it to the tobacco issue and the master settlement that occurred, I don't know, 20 years, with the issue of tobacco. Whether there is something that's analogous to that, I don't know. But it's --\nQ: Do you see it in that light, Mr. Secretary?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, what I see is that there is -- that we continue to move in the wrong direction on the number of individuals that are not only addicted, but the number of individuals that are losing their lives to addiction. And so the President is absolutely committed to solving that problem, and we are going to turn over every single rock and make certain that we're identifying every single thing that could move us in a better direction.\nQ: Is it a national emergency?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, the President certainly believes that we will treat it as an emergency -- and it is an emergency. When you have the capacity of Yankee Stadium or Dodger Stadium dying every single year in this nation, that's a crisis that has to be given incredible attention, and the President is giving it that attention.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, thank you. I was curious -- those of us old enough to remember the crack problem 20-plus years ago, how is this different? And how is the approach to deal with the opioid problem going to be any different? And are we just going through a cycle of a new crisis every 20 years and the public forgets? I mean, what's different here?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, it's different for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the magnitude and the numbers of individuals succumbing to addiction and losing their lives. And this is relatively recent; in the past 10 to 15 years, these numbers have spiked up. So the difference is that the crack cocaine issue, which was a terrible, terrible issue, but it didn't have the potency of the medication that exists right now. Right now, carfentanyl and fentanyl exist in a way that kill individuals with very small doses. The cost of illicit drugs, the cost of heroin, for example, is significantly lower than it has been. So the access to these drugs is that much greater.\nSo it may be cyclic in terms of generational engagement or involvement, but, as Kellyanne said, this knows no age distribution. It's affecting folks young and old across all demographics in our society. So we believe that it is different if only because of the potency of the medication and the numbers of individuals who are succumbing to it.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Secretary Price, thank you. I do have a question for Kellyanne, but first to you. Why has the President not officially declared the opioid crisis a national emergency? And does he plan to?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, most national emergencies that have been declared in the area of public health emergency have been focused on a specific area, a time-limited problem -- either an infectious disease or a specific threat to public health. The two most recent that come to mind are the Zika outbreak and Hurricane Sandy. So we believe that, as this point, that the resources that we need, or the focus that we need to bring to bear to the opioid crisis at this point can be addressed without the declaration of an emergency, although all things are on the table for the President.\nQ: So it's not imminent that he would do that, but it's on the table.\nSECRETARY PRICE: All things are on the table.\nQ: Okay. And then, Ms. Kellyanne Conway, if you'd like to weigh in on that. And then also, if I can ask you about the President's comments on North Korea. He said that North Korea, if they continue their threats, will be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen.\" Can you explain specifically what he meant by \"fire and fury\"? Is that military action?\nMS. CONWAY: No, I can't. I think the President's comments were very strong and obvious. I know all of you covered them live. And I would defer to other members of Dr. Price's cabinet to comment further.\nQ: And anything you want to add to the emergency status question?\nMS. CONWAY: No, because I'll leave that to the health professionals. But I will tell you that the President and the First Lady are taking very seriously what is an absolute epidemic, and they see it that way also. We are at a very peak level. And one thing I should have mentioned earlier that is a very important component here is destigmatizing the use -- the misuse of substances. We find time and again people are just too fearful to come forward and admit that they have a problem, admit it to the people closest -- their family members, their friends, their colleagues.\nAnd also, something that we discussed with the President and the First Lady at length are the different accounts that we've heard in states, and you can see the stories for yourselves:\n\"We're so sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Jones. We tried to save your son. In fact, we resuscitated him three or four times over the last six or eight months, but this time he was too far gone.\" And they say, who, what, when? They don't even know that their son or their loved one has had a substance misuse disorder -- a substance abuse disorder. And sometimes the privacy laws don't allow parents of a 19-year-old, in fact, to be notified. So this is something of which we're very aware also.\nQ: The President's commission on the opioid crisis recommended that the President urgently, immediately call this a national emergency because that frees up resources; that lifts some of these barriers that allows more Medicaid recipients to go into treatment. Why do you feel like that isn't something that needs to happen right now? I mean, was the commission wrong on this?\nSECRETARY PRICE: No, there's an interim report from the commission and it's being reviewed at all different levels of the government. But everything that you just mentioned can be done, and many of it -- much of it is being done without the declaration of a national emergency -- either a Stafford Act emergency or a public health emergency. So --\nQ: So they've expanded to let more Medicaid recipients --\nSECRETARY PRICE: Everything that you talked about can be done. Now, we're talking about what should be done, and working through the department and through the other agencies that I mentioned, to come forward with that coherent strategy, that comprehensive strategy and recommendation for the President, and we'll do so in short order.\nQ: Yes, just to follow up on something Kellyanne Conway said. So are you looking at changing privacy laws or HIPAA around drug addiction, specifically? I guess either of you can answer it.\nSECRETARY PRICE: Yeah, this is really an important issue because one of the things that we've found when going around the country is that it's the local communities, it's the local, loving community -- the families, the organizations within communities -- that are so pivotal to providing success for individuals getting through the treatment and on to recovery.\nAnd so it's devastating for anybody to learn of a family who is not able to be notified that one of their loved ones has had a problem with addiction because of privacy laws. So we're looking through the regulatory process to determine what can be done, if anything, to make it so that those requirements are not -- those privacy requirements are not as onerous in the case of an overdose. And it certainly is something that Congress could address, and we'll talking with them and have had conversations with many of them about that.\nQ: Speaking of Congress, is the healthcare bill dead?\nSECRETARY PRICE: The healthcare challenge across this nation is not dead, and so what we believe needs to occur is that the Congress needs to address the issue in a way that allows individuals to gain the kind of access to coverage and care that they need.\nThank you all so much. Thank you.\nQ: Do you still want to cut Medicaid drastically? Because the report talks a lot about Medicaid use.\nSECRETARY PRICE: Nobody is interested in cutting Medicaid. The fact of the matter is that the President's budget and the proposals that were before Congress were an effort to try to secure and make a Medicaid system work for patients. That's the goal that we have.\nWe have one-third of the physicians in this nation who ought to be seeing Medicaid patients who aren't seeing Medicaid patients. That's a system that may work for the federal government, it may work for insurance companies, it may even work for Medicaid programs, but it doesn't work for patients.\nThe President's goal, the President's desire, our focus, and our desire is to make certain that we have a healthcare system that works for patients.\nThank you all.\nEND 4:57 P.M.

Thank you very much, Secretary Price, for your work to address the crisis of opioid, heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamines. It is a tremendous problem in our country, and we're going to get it taken care of as well as it can be taken care of, which, hopefully, will be better than any other country which also has these same problems or similar problems.\nNobody is safe from this epidemic that threatens young and old, rich and poor, urban and rural communities. Everybody is threatened. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, and opioid overdose deaths have nearly quadrupled since 1999. It is a problem the likes of which we have not seen.\nMeanwhile, Federal drug prosecutions have gone down in recent years. We're going to be bringing them up and bringing them up rapidly. At the end of 2016, there were 23 percent fewer than in 2011. So they looked at this scourge, and they let it go by, and we're not letting it go by. The average sentence length for a convicted Federal drug offender decreased 20 percent from 2009 to 2016.\nDuring my campaign, I promised to fight this battle because, as President of the United States, my greatest responsibility is to protect the American people and to ensure their safety. Especially in some parts of our country, it is horrible what's going on with opioid and other drugs. But the opioid is something that nobody has seen anything like it.\nToday I am pleased to receive a briefing from our team on ways we can help our communities combat this absolutely terrible epidemic and keep youth from going down this deadly path. The best way to prevent drug addiction and overdose is to prevent people from abusing drugs in the first place. If they don't start, they won't have a problem. If they do start, it's awfully tough to get off. So if we can keep them from going on, and maybe by talking to youth and telling them, \"No good, really bad for you in every way.\" But if they don't start, it will never be a problem.\nWe're also working with law enforcement officers to protect innocent citizens from drug dealers that poison our communities. Strong law enforcement is absolutely vital to having a drug-free society. I have had the opportunity to hear from many on the front lines of the opioid epidemic, and I'm confident that by working with our health care and law enforcement experts, we will fight this deadly epidemic, and the United States will win.\nWe're also very, very tough on the southern border, where much of this comes in. And we're talking to China, where certain forms of manmade drug comes in, and it is bad. And we're speaking to other countries, and we're getting cooperation, but we're being very, very strong on our southern border and, I would say, the likes of which this country certainly has never seen that kind of strength.\nSo we're going to do our job. We're going to get it going. We have a tremendous team of experts and people that want to beat this horrible situation that's happened in our country, and we will. We will win. We have no alternative. We have to win for our youth. We have to win for our young people. And frankly, we have to win for a lot of other people, not necessarily young, that are totally addicted and have serious, serious problems. So we thank you all for being here. And we're going to get on with our meeting. Thank you very much. Thank you all. Thank you.\nNorth Korea\nQ. Any comment on the reports about North Korea's nuclear capabilities?\nThe President.

Mattis; Chairman of the Korean Worker's Party Kim Jong Un of North Korea; and U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Nikki R. Haley. A reporter referred to Sean Hannity, anchor, Fox News' \"Hannity\" program.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128090", "text": "The President. Hello, everybody. We're having some meetings. I know you're going to be watching a couple of them. We have a lot of people here today, a lot of subjects under discussion, including Venezuela; including, of course, North Korea; and other things. And I think we're making tremendous headway.\nWe'll be spending quite a bit of time here, and then we—during the weekend, as you know—toward the end, we're going to Manhattan where I have a lot of meetings scheduled in Manhattan.\nAny questions?\nNorth Korea\nQ. Mr. President, the North Koreans said yesterday that your statement on Tuesday was \"nonsense\"—that's the word that they used. Do you have any response to that?\nThe President. Well, I don't think they mean that, and I think they—it's the first time they've heard it like they heard it. And frankly, the people that were questioning that statement, \"Was it too tough?\"—maybe it wasn't tough enough. They've been doing this to our country for a long time, for many years. And it's about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries.\nSo, if anything, maybe that statement wasn't tough enough, and we're backed by a hundred percent by our military. We're backed by everybody, and we're backed by many other leaders. And I noticed that many Senators and others today came out very much in favor of what I said. But, if anything, that statement may not be tough enough.\nQ. What would be tougher than \"fire and fury\"?\nThe President. Well, you'll see. You'll see.\nQ. Mr. President, is one of the options being considered a preemptive strike or first strike——\nThe President. We don't talk about that. I never do. I'm not like the other administration that would say we're going into Mosul in 4 months. I don't talk about it.\nQ. Mr. President——\nThe President. We'll see what happens. But I can tell you that what they've been doing and what they've been getting away with is a tragedy, and it can't be allowed.\nDiplomatic Efforts With North Korea\nQ. Mr. President, would you ever consider negotiations under different circumstances?\nThe President. Sure. We'll always consider negotiations, but they've been negotiating now for 25 years. Look at Clinton. He folded on the negotiations. He was weak and ineffective. You look what happened with Bush; you look what happened with Obama. Obama, he didn't even want to talk about it. But I talk. It's about time. Somebody has to do it. Somebody has to do it. Senate Majority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell/Health Care Reform Legislation/The President's Legislative Agenda\nQ. Mr. President, can you talk about your relationship with Senator McConnell?\nThe President. I just want him to get repeal and replace done. I've been hearing repeal and replace now for 7 years, but I've only been doing this for 2 years. And I've really only been doing this for 6 months. But I've been running, so now it's almost 2 years. And I—all I hear is repeal and replace, and then I get there, and I said: \"Where is the bill? I want to sign it.\" First day, and they don't have it.\nAnd they passed repeal and replace, but they never had a President, frankly, or a Senate that was going to do it. But they never have had a President, so it didn't matter. So I say very simply: Where is repeal and replace? Now I want tax reform and tax cuts. We're going to reduce taxes for the people. We pay more tax than anybody in the world, and we're going to reduce taxes.\nSo I say tax cuts, tax reform, and I want a very big infrastructure bill, where we're working on that very hard already, and we can do that. And we may even get bipartisan on infrastructure, but we want to have it.\nBut I said, \"Mitch, get to work, and let's get it done.\" They should have had this last one done. They lost by one vote. For a thing like that to happen is a disgrace, and frankly, it shouldn't have happened. That I can tell you.\nSenate Majority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell\nQ. Should Senator McConnell consider stepping down as Majority Leader? There's some conservative analysts, including Sean Hannity, who say it's time for him to retire.\nThe President. Well, I'll tell you what: If he doesn't get repeal and replace done, if he doesn't get taxes done—meaning cuts and reform—and if he doesn't get a very easy one to get done, infrastructure—if he doesn't get them done, then you can ask me that question.\nQ. So what is that, a yes or a no?\nThe President. You can ask me the—that means ask me that question. Let's hope he gets it done.\nOpioid Crisis\nQ. Mr. President, is the opioid crisis an emergency? And if so, why haven't you declared it one?\nThe President. The opioid crisis is an emergency, and I'm saying officially right now: It is an emergency. It's a national emergency. We're going to spend a lot of time, a lot effort, and a lot of money on the opioid crisis.\nQ. But do you need emergency powers to address it?\nThe President. We're going to draw it up, and we're going to make it a national emergency. It is a serious problem, the likes of which we have never had. You know, when I was growing up they had the LSD, and they had certain generations of drugs. There's never been anything like what's happened to this country over the last 4 or 5 years. And I have to say this, in all fairness, this is a worldwide problem not just a United States problem. This is happening worldwide. But this is a national emergency, and we are drawing documents now to so attest.\nNorth Korea\nQ. Mr. President, there's been some mixed messages coming out of your administration on North Korea. Secretary Tillerson seemed to advocate for diplomacy. Secretary Mattis seemed to advocate for more——\nThe President. There are no mixed messages. There are no mixed messages. I heard—I mean, to be honest, General Mattis may have taken it a step beyond what I said. There are no mixed messages. And Rex was just stating the views—look, here's the view. I said it yesterday. I don't have to say it again. And I'll tell you this: It may be tougher than I said it, not less. It may very well be tougher than I said it. Okay?\nHow about one more?\nNorth Korea/China/Russia\nQ. Can you offer any assurance to the American people who are understandably anxious about the situation with North Korea? They see images of these missiles coming up in the air, the threats to Guam, they see your statement about \"fire and fury.\" Should they be comfortable that you have this under control?\nThe President. The people of this country should be very comfortable. And I will tell you this: If North Korea does anything in terms of even thinking about attack of anybody that we love or we represent or our allies or us, they can be very, very nervous—I'll tell you what—and they should be very nervous. Because things will happen to them like they never thought possible. Okay?\nHe's been pushing the world around for a long time. And I have great respect for what China and what Russia did and those 15—we got a 15-to-nothing vote. I have great respect for China and Russia, what they did on sanctions. I believe that will have an effect. I don't think it will have the kind of effect—even though I was the one—we were the ones that got it. And Nikki Haley did a great job. We all did a great job. But I have great respect for what they did; I have great respect for the 15 to nothing, but probably, it will not be as effective as a lot of people think it can be, unfortunately.\nChina/North Korea\nQ. Can China do more?\nThe President. I think China can do a lot more, yes. China can. And I think China will do a lot more. Look, we have trade with China. We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel. It's not going to continue like that. But if China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade. A lot differently toward trade.\nSo we will do, I think—the people of our country are safe; our allies are safe. And I will tell you this: North Korea better get their act together, or they're going to be in trouble like few nations ever have been in trouble in this world. Okay?\nThank you very much. We're going down to the other side, and we will—we're going to take a few more questions. Okay? Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-08-10", "title": "Remarks Prior to a Security Briefing and an Exchange With Reporters in Bedminster, New Jersey"}

We actually had a much larger group than this. This is the finals. But we discussed many things. And one of them obviously was North Korea. We discussed Venezuela. We discussed Afghanistan and the Middle East, generally. We had some very good meetings, some very good ideas, very good thoughts, and a lot of decisions were made. This was a very important day, actually. Made a lot of decisions.\nWith that, if you have any questions. Yes?\nAfghanistan\nQ. Did you make any decision on Afghanistan, whether to add additional troops?\nThe President. Yes, we're getting close. We're getting very close. It's a very big decision for me. I took over a mess, and we're going to make it a lot less messy. But that has been a place—17 years—our longest war, as I read in one of your columns. And frankly, it's going to be a decision that's going to be made very soon.\nNational Security Adviser H.R. McMaster\nQ. And do you have full confidence in your National Security Adviser?\nThe President. Yes, I do. General McMaster?\nQ. Yes.\nThe President. Absolutely. . He's our friend. He's my friend. And he's a very talented man. I like him, and I respect him.\nThe President's Twitter Announcement Prohibiting Transgender Individuals From Serving in the U.S. Armed Forces\nQ. Sir, why did you decide to announce the transgender ban reversal a couple of weeks ago? Are you betraying a community that you pledged to support during the campaign?\nThe President. No, no. Look, I have great respect for the community. I think I have great support—or I've had great support from that community. I got a lot of votes. But the transgender—the military is working on it now. They're doing the work. It's been a very difficult situation. And I think I'm doing a lot of people a favor by coming out and just saying it. As you know, it's been a very complicated issue for the military. It's been a very confusing issue for the military. And I think I'm doing the military a great favor.\nRussia's Expulsion of U.S. Diplomatic Personnel\nQ. Mr. President, do you have any response to the Russian President expelling 755 workers from our Embassies?\nThe President. No. I want to thank him, because we're trying to cut down on payroll. And as far as I'm concerned, I'm very thankful that he let go of a large number of people, because now we have a smaller payroll. There's no real reason for them to go back. So he—I greatly appreciate the fact that they've been able to cut our payroll for the United States.\nQ. Is that your official response?\nThe President. We'll save a lot of money.\nFormer Trump Presidential Campaign Chairman Paul J. Manafort, Jr.\nQ. Mr. President, was it appropriate for the FBI to raid the home of Paul Manafort predawn, in the early morning—[inaudible]?\nThe President. I thought it was a very, very strong signal or whatever. I know Mr. Manafort. I haven't spoken to him in a long time, but I know him. He was with the campaign, as you know, for a very short period of time, relatively short period of time. But I've always known him to be a good man.\nQ. He was the chairman.\nThe President. I thought it was a very, you know—they do that very seldom. So I was surprised to see it. I was very, very surprised to see it. We haven't really been involved.\nQ. Have you spoken to the FBI Director about it?\nThe President. Excuse me?\nQ. Have you spoken to the FBI Director about it or the Attorney General?\nThe President. No, I have not. I have not. But to do that early in the morning, whether or not it was appropriate, you'd have to ask them. I've always found Paul Manafort to be a very decent man. And he's like a lot of other people, probably makes consultant fees from all over the place. Who knows? I don't know. But I thought that was a very—that was pretty tough stuff——\nQ. Mr. President, speaking of——\nThe President. To wake him up, perhaps his family was there, I think that's pretty tough stuff.\nAttorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III/White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly/Border Security/The President's Accomplishments/Deregulation\nQ. Mr. President, speaking of the Attorney General, have you—how would you categorize your relationship currently with Attorney General Sessions? Have you guys spoken about some of the differences you've had in the past?\nThe President. It's fine. It is what it is. It's fine. He's working hard on the border. I'm very proud of what we've done on the border. I'm very proud of General Kelly, what he's done on the border. One of the reasons he's my Chief of Staff right now is because he did such an outstanding job at the border. We're down 78 percent. Nobody thought that would be—I mean, in the old days, with other administrations, if you were down 1 percent, it was considered a big thing. We're down 78 percent at the border, and nobody thought that was possible. So I'm very proud of General Kelly. He's now Chief of Staff.\nAt the same time, I'm very proud of what we've done over the last 6 months, between Supreme Court, between tremendous amounts of legislation that's been passed. We had 42 to 48 bills passed. I'm not talking about just Executive orders, I'm talking about bills passed. We had massive Executive orders. We got rid of record-setting amounts of regulations, and a lot of it is statutory, where it's a 90-day period, then you have to wait. Then, it's another 90-day period, you have to wait 30 days. Much more is coming out.\nAnd I believe in regulation. You have to have to some regulation. But we're going to have a small percentage of regulation compared to what we have. And I think that's why you see business enthusiasm is the highest it's been in 18 years; why unemployment is the lowest it's been in 18 years. Again, the unemployment rate just came out; it's the lowest it's been in 18 years. And with that being said, we have companies moving into the United States, whether it's Foxconn. You saw the two large auto companies moving back; probably, they'll go to Michigan, but they're negotiating with various States.\nWe have had—we have done a lot in a short period of time. So I'm very proud of it. I think that General Kelly is going to be a fantastic Chief of Staff, however.\nU.S. Military Presence in Asia/North Korea/Korean Worker's Party Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea\nQ. Mr. President, are you going to increase the U.S. military presence in Asia?\nThe President. We are going to look at what's happening in Asia. We're looking at it right now. We're constantly looking at it. I don't like to signal what I'm going to be doing, but we are certainly looking at it. And obviously, we're spending a lot of time looking at, in particular, North Korea. And we are preparing for many different, alternative events at North Korea—if—he has disrespected our country greatly. He has said things that are horrific. And with me, he's not getting away with it. He got away with it for a long time, between him and his family. He's not getting away with it. It's a whole new ballgame.\nAnd he's not going to be saying those things, and he's certainly not going to be doing those things. I read about, \"We're in Guam by August 15.\" Let's see what he does with Guam. He does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody has seen before, what will happen in North Korea.\nKorean Worker's Party Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea\nQ. And when you say that, what do you mean?\nThe President. You'll see. You'll see. And he'll see. He will see.\nQ. Is that a dare?\nThe President. It's not a dare, it's a statement. It has nothing to do with dare. That's a statement. He's not going to go around threatening Guam, and he's not going to threaten the United States. And he's not going to threaten Japan, and he's not going to threaten South Korea. No, that's not a dare, as you say. That is a statement of fact.\nDenuclearization/U.S. Nuclear Arsenal\nQ. Mr. President, can you talk about the nuclear posture and what your priorities are there?\nThe President. Yes. Nuclear to me—number one: I would like to denuke the world. I know that President Obama said global warming is the biggest threat. I totally disagree. I say that it's a simple one: Nuclear is our greatest threat worldwide. Not even a question, not even close. So I'd like to denuke the world. I would like Russia and the United States and China and Pakistan and many other countries that have nuclear weapons, get rid of them. But until such time as they do, we will be the most powerful nuclear nation on Earth by far. The first order I gave to my generals, as you know—you know, Mike—my first order was: I want this, our nuclear arsenal, to be the biggest and the finest in the world. And we spent a lot of money, a lot of time, and a lot of effort. And it's in tip-top shape and getting better and getting stronger. And until such time as this scourge disappears, we will be so much better and so much stronger than anybody else. And nobody, including North Korea, is going to be threatening us with anything.\nQ. Sir, what specifically have you changed in the nuclear arsenal? And the reason I ask is that a lot of experts yesterday, in response to your tweet, said that modernizing the arsenal takes many years; it can't be done in 6 months. It's a long process that's only just begun——\nThe President. We've done a lot of modernization, but we've done a lot of renovation. And we have it now in very, very good shape. And it will be in much better shape over the next 6 months to a year.\nQ. Mr. President——\nThe President. It's a very important thing. Actually, it was the first—military is very important to me. As you know, I did extremely well with the military vote, Mike and I.\nBut we are—my first order was, we have to do the military, but before we do the military per se, we're going to do the nuclear. And we are in very strong shape. We are going to be increasing our budget by many billions of dollars because of North Korea and other reasons having to do with the antimissile. So we are going to be increasing our budget by many billions of dollars. We'll probably be able to report that over the next week.\nAs you know, we reduced it by 5 percent, but I've decided I don't want that. We're going to be increasing the antimissiles by a substantial amount of billions of dollars.\nIran\nQ. Mr. President, can you share with us your latest thoughts on Iran, speaking of nuclear deals, and the—whether you feel like they are in compliance or will be in compliance?\nThe President. I don't think Iran is in compliance. We wrote them a very tough letter to the—as you know, to the Congress. I personally don't think they're in compliance. But we have time, and we're going to see. We also put down a lot of defaults or potential default situations. I don't think they're living up to the spirit of the agreement. President Obama in his wisdom gave them $150 billion. He gave them $1.8 billion in cash, which is—that's a hard one to figure. But that was his decision. I think it's a horrible agreement. But they are not in compliance with the agreement, and they are certainly not in the spirit of the agreement in compliance.\nAnd I think you'll see some very strong things taking place if they don't get themselves in compliance. But I do not believe they are in compliance right now.\nLeaking of Classified Information\nQ. Mr. President, what's the latest on the leak investigation that the Attorney General announced late last week? And is there any separate investigation that you're looking at——\nThe President. Yes, sure. We're looking. We're always looking. You have two leaks. You have the leaks coming out of intelligence and various departments having to do with Syria, having to do with all sorts of different places, having to do, frankly, with North Korea. And those are very serious. And then, you have the leaks where people want to love me, and they're all fighting for love. [Laughter] Those are not very important, but certainly, we don't like them. Those are little, inner-White House leaks. They're not very important. But actually, I'm somewhat honored by them.\nBut the important leaks to me—and they're leaks that the Attorney General is looking at very strongly—are the leaks coming out of intelligence. And we have to stop them for the security and the national security of our country.\nDepartment of Justice Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III/Russian Interference in 2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Mr. President, are you passing notes to the Special Counsel, Bob Mueller? Can you talk a little bit about what those——\nThe President. No, not notes. We're working with them. I mean, we have a situation which is very unusual. Everybody said there's no collusion. You look at the counsels that come in. We have a Senate hearing, we have Judiciary, we have Intelligence, and we have a House hearing. And everybody walks out, even the enemies, and they said, no, well there is no collusion, there's no collusion.\nSo they're investigating something that never happened. There was no collusion between us and Russia. In fact, the opposite. Russia spent a lot of money on fighting me. And if you think about it, I want a strong military. You see our budget is up by—it will be hundreds of billions of dollars soon, our military budget. Russia doesn't like that. Hillary was going to cut the budget substantially, the military budget. Russia is—very important for Russia—oil. Oil and gas. We are now an exporter—because of an incredible 6 months that I have—an exporter of oil and gas. That's bad for Russia.\nI always said, I don't think Russia wants me, because I want a strong military and I want low energy prices. Energy is a disaster—low energy prices is a disaster for Russia. Additionally, it seems that Russia spent a lot of money on that false report, and that was Russian money, and I think it was Democrat money too. You could say that was collusion. Plus, the Democrats colluded on the Ukraine. So they colluded. And then, when you get down to it, why isn't the FBI looking at the DNC server? You have a server that they refuse—the Democrats refuse to give to the FBI. Now, I don't know how the FBI can investigate something if the DNC, the Democrats, refuse to give the server.\nSo we have an investigation of something that never took place. And all I say is, work with them, because this is an event that never took place.\nNow, as far as somebody else, where—did they file the right papers or did they forget to file a paper? You know, I guarantee if you went around to look at everybody that made a speech or whatever these people did, that's up to them. Did they do something wrong because they didn't file the right document or whatever? Perhaps. You'll have to look at them. But I guarantee you this: Probably, a lot of people in Washington did the same thing.\nBipartisanship/Infrastructure\nQ. Mr. President, given your harsh criticism of Democrats just now, how are you going to bring them in on things like infrastructure or health care reform?\nThe President. Well, we'll have to see. I'm not sure that we will bring them in. I mean, maybe we'll bring them in, maybe not. I think the infrastructure bill will be bipartisan. In fact, frankly, it may have more support from the Democrats. I want a very strong infrastructure bill. We've, as of this moment, spent over $6 trillion in the Middle East. As far as I'm concerned, when I say \"spent,\" we've wasted $6 trillion in the Middle East, and yet we can't fix our roads and our bridges and our schools and our airports. And I think that's a very sad situation. So I'm very strong on infrastructure, and a lot of Republicans are, but I know a lot of Democrats are also. I think that will work out. I think it's going to work out very well.\nDepartment of Justice Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III/Russian Interference in 2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Mr. President, you have sought or thought about or considered leading the dismissal of the Special Counsel. Is there anything that Bob Mueller could do that you would—send you in that direction?\nThe President. I haven't given it any thought. I mean, I've been reading about it from you people. You say, oh, I'm going to dismiss him. No, I'm not dismissing anybody. I mean, I want them to get on with the task, but I also want the Senate and the House to come out with their findings.\nNow, judging from the people leaving the meetings—leaks—but they leave the meetings all the time, and they say, no, we haven't found any collusion. There is no collusion. You know why? Because I don't speak to Russians.\nLook, I won because I suppose I was a much better candidate than her. I won because I went to Wisconsin, I went to Michigan, I won Pennsylvania. I fought a smart battle. That's why I win. I didn't win because of Russia. Russia had nothing to do with me winning. The thing that—we had a great team, and I guess I did a good job. And you know what, honestly, they spent much more money than I did, by a lot. You know that. They spent a lot more money, and honestly, they did not do a very good job of campaigning.\nSenate Majority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell\nQ. And one more question about Senator—Senate Leader McConnell. We talked about him—you talked about him outside a little bit earlier, but have you reached out to him since your phone call yesterday?\nThe President. No.\nSecretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao/Senate Majority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell/Governor James C. Justice II of West Virginia/Domestic Manufacturing\nQ. And have you given any consideration to asking his wife, your Transportation Secretary, to help bridge whatever divide you guys——\nThe President. Elaine is doing a very good job. We're very proud of Elaine as Secretary of Transportation, as you know—as you said, Mitch's wife. She is doing a very, very good job. I'm very disappointed in Mitch. But if he gets these bills passed, I'll be very happy with him. And I'll be the first to admit it. But honestly, repeal and replace of Obamacare should have taken place, and it should have been on my desk virtually the first week that I was there or the first day that I was there. I've been hearing about it for 7 years.\nSo repeal and replace should have taken place. The tax bill, tax cuts, tax reform, hopefully, they get that done. I hope they get it done. And the other thing would be the infrastructure bill. In addition to that—you know, we've passed a lot of things. We've passed accountability with the VA. We've passed a lot. We're doing a lot of great work at the VA. And we're doing a lot of great work all over. You look at what's happening with the coal industry where they're putting on—I mean, I looked at West Virginia the other day—I was in West Virginia making a speech, and they are doing great as a State. The great Governor of West Virginia, Jim—who you saw—he just became a Republican. He left. This is the first time in many, many years that a thing like that's happened. He just left the Democratic Party, and he became a Republican, which was a great moment. Hasn't happened in many years.\nSo we're very, very happy with what's happened. We think it's been an incredible 6 months. We've done a lot of record-setting business. It's incredible. You look at what's going on with the economy. And you know, to me, very important, you look at the enthusiasm of businesses. You look at companies moving back in. You just saw on Friday the two big car companies that are coming in. You saw last week, Foxconn. They make the Apple iPhones, they make all of the desktops. They make—they're the biggest in the world. They're coming into Wisconsin with an unbelievable plant like we've never seen before.\nAnd I actually said to Tim Cook of Apple—I said, you know, Tim, I won't consider myself successful as President unless I see you start building those big, beautiful plants that you have all over China, you start building them in the United States. And he's going to do that.\nU.S. Intelligence Community/Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher A. Wray/2003 Invasion of Iraq\nQ. Mr. President, you were critical of the intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq war. Should we question the intelligence now we're hearing about North Korea?\nThe President. Well, it's different intelligence. I have Mike Pompeo. I have great confidence in him. That doesn't mean I had confidence in his predecessor. Okay? Which I didn't, actually, although——\nQ. You called the intelligence—[inaudible].\nThe President. Although he did say good things about me. He did say he had no information or no anything on collusion. So I shouldn't maybe say that, but I will say it. But I have tremendous confidence in Mike Pompeo. Dan Coats, fantastic. I mean, we have people. I think your new head of the FBI is going to be—I think I've done a great service for this country. I think that Christopher will do a fantastic job as the head of the FBI.\nSo look, I have—nobody has greater respect for intelligence than Donald Trump, but you have to have the right leaders. I think we have great leaders right now. And you can look at the intelligence over the years. It was intelligence that got people to make one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country: going into Iraq. Because they said there were no weapons. You know, you look at it—it ended up being there were no weapons of mass destruction. They said—I mean, listening to them, weapons of mass destruction were all over the place, but they were not there. That was intelligence.\nI have great respect for intelligence as led by the people that I have in charge now. We have great people, and I think it's going to lead us to tremendous victories. And that's what we need, so——\nU.S. Intelligence Community/North Korea\nQ. What is that intelligence telling you about North Korea and the nuclear—— The President. It's telling me a lot of things, but what—you'll probably find out about it before anybody else, right? [Laughter]\nQ. Well, tell us now.\nThe President. With your leaks. We've got to stop the leaks. The leaks are very dangerous for our country. But no, I have great respect for the intelligence community. And I think with the leadership we have right now, hopefully, it will be a very, very successful 8 years for this country. And then, after that, we'll continue onward.\nBut you have a lot of things we have to straighten out. You have the Middle East; you have North Korea. We have a lot of places of tremendous conflict and tremendous danger for this country.\nI will say, getting the 15-to-nothing vote at the United Nations from the Security Council the other day, that's something that very few Presidents would have been able to get. And I have great respect for the fact that China and Russia went along with it. That was a tremendous day for the United States. I think it will have a strong impact on North Korea. I don't know that it will be the end-all, but I think it will be a very, very—I think it will have a big impact on North Korea and what they're doing.\nThank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thanks.", "timestamp": "2017-08-10", "title": "Remarks Following a Security Briefing and an Exchange With Reporters in Bedminster, New Jersey"}

You have known me too long to believe them. (Laughter.) But I couldn't be more proud of the job Governor Eric Holcomb and First Lady Janet Halcomb are doing for the state of Indiana. (Applause.)\nAnd to my friend, Jim Atterholt, my chief of staff here at the State House, thank you for your efforts in putting together this incredible reunion. And thank you for your integrity, and thank you for your ongoing service to the people of Indiana. Jim, you are a cherished friend, and you are loadstar of what service to the people of Indiana really means. Thank you. (Applause.)\nOn behalf of my family, my extended family, my mom, and all the people of the Pence team who have come near and far to be with us today, it is great to be back home again. (Applause.)\nI want to thank so many distinguished public officials who are here. Senator Todd Young, thank you for joining us today, for your great leadership in Washington. Congressman Luke Messer; Congressman Todd Rokita; Lieutenant Governor Crouch and former Lieutenant Governor Ellspermann; Speaker Brian Bosman, my great partner in this general assembly; Senator David Long, President Pro Tem of the Senate; Auditor Klutz; Attorney General Hill; Superintendent McCormick; and I see all these great members of the best state legislature in America. Would you give all these public officials a great, great round of applause? (Applause.)\nAnd I'm so touched to be here by so many long-term members of our team, most of which we have taken to Washington with us. (Laughter.) People like Jennifer Pavlik and Matt Lloyd, Lani Czarniecki, and others. I'm grateful to you all. I'm grateful for your ongoing service to the country. And to my dear friend, Bill Smith, my former chief of staff who is with us here today; Mark Ahearn, Micah Vincent, and others. It's deeply moving to share this moment with you.\nAnd to my extended family -- and to know the Pence family is to know a big family -- my brother Greg, who is with us today with his wonderful wife Denise; my brother Ed and his wife Kim; Annie and her daughter Gracie; my father-in-law Bernie; my mother's husband, Basil; and to my incredible mom, Nancy Pence-Fritsch, who inspires me every day and is so responsible for this day. (Applause.) And, of course, I'll mention her more in just a moment, but to be joined here today by at least one out of three of our great kids, our youngest daughter Audrey Pence who is with us today. And to my incredible wife of 32 years, the Second Lady of the United States of America, Karen Pence. Thanks for getting us here. (Applause.)\nI stand before you today deeply humbled -- deeply humbled to be able to continue to serve this state as the 48th Vice President of the United States. And I owe it all -- I owe it all to the confidence of the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. And he wanted me to tell the great people of Indiana that he said hello and wanted to thank you for this great honor -- for his running mate. (Applause.)\nBut I owe this moment to my family -- my immediate family and my extended family. Mostly, I owe this moment to the good people of Indiana. Words really cannot describe the honor it has been to serve the people of this state. You know, I grew up the grandson of an Irish immigrant who came to this country when he was about my son's age, in his 20s. And he raised that precocious redhead at the end of the stage. And she and my late father lived the American Dream.\nI grew up in a little house in Columbus, Indiana on 31st street -- a little cornfield in the backyard that's still there to this day. And we were all raised to believe that anybody can be anybody in this country; that if you work hard, pray harder, if you look after your family, you grab your dreams, the sky is the limit. But it's to my family, to their legacy, and it's to the people of Indiana that I came today to say thank you -- to say thank you for the opportunities that you've given me to serve; the support that you continue to give me and my family through your encouraging words and most especially your prayers.\nAnd let me say that wherever we go in our lives and our service for the next seven-and-a-half years as Vice President of the United States or beyond -- (applause) -- I want the people of Indiana to know that you're always in our hearts, and the depth of our gratitude is inexpressible for the privileges and opportunities you've given us to serve.\nNow, for a word about this portrait. I just wanted you to know a few things about it. And maybe, Governor Holcomb, you can have the tour guides mention this when they're passing through. First off, let me just say I do have more than one tie. (Laughter and applause.) But I'll explain in just a few moments why I wore it again today.\nFirst, let me just express a debt of gratitude to those that have gone before. It's deeply humbling for me to think that this image will be added to a historic collection here at the State House. I've had the privilege to know many of my predecessors, and I consider them all my betters, Republican or Democrat notwithstanding.\nToday, I want to honor Governor Whitcomb, Governor Bowen, Governor Orr, Governor Bayh, Governor O'Bannon, Governor Kernan, and Governor Daniels. It is my great honor to join them in this pantheon of public service in the state of Indiana. We honor their service today. (Applause.) Eric, I often thought, as I came to work in the morning, of that verse in the Old Book that says you're surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses. So I hope you feel the same when you're coming into the office. (Laughter.)\nSecondly, I want to thank this extraordinary artist, Mark Dillman, and to no less extent, his wife, Lynn, who was his full partner in this effort. We interviewed a fair number of great artists, and then I talked to a guy who was a Southsider -- from the Southside of Indianapolis -- and we just immediately bonded. Mark told me he'd been following my career long before it was successful. (Laughter.)\nAnd, Mark, I have to tell you, I'm inspired by your gifts and I want to thank you publicly for your efforts in putting together this extraordinary portrait. Would you thank Mark for me? (Applause.) Mark told me he wanted it to be his best one ever. And given what you had to work with, I think it is. (Laughter.)\nThe portrait is really just about paying tribute to all those that are not the subject of the portrait. First, the flags. The flags are my tribute to the great Americans and the great Hoosiers I've had the privilege to serve. When I took my oath of office just out on the West steps on a cold day in January, I took my oath of office on a verse that's a prayer. And that prayer is, \"Give [me] a discerning heart to distinguish between right and wrong; for who is able to govern this great people of yours?\" And I always thought that was a particularly apt verse for the people of Indiana. It is my great honor to serve the great people of Indiana. And the flag in this portrait and the American flag are my tribute to them.\nSecondly, just to the side of me, you might see a short stack of books. And that's really a tribute to my folks. One gone and one still the apple of my eye. Mark was able to recreate a short stack of law books that I inherited from my dad. And there's a great story about my dad actually went to one semester of law school, but he had to drop out because he met this redhead and he figured he better get on with his life and go make a living. But those law books now are in the Vice President's House in Washington, D.C., but they're the tribute to my parents -- because we all stand on the shoulders of those who went before, and everything I am is owing to the sacrifices, the successes, and the efforts of my dad, Ed Pence, and my wonderful mother, Nancy Pence-Fritsch. (Applause.)\nAnd the kids, you can see them in the picture. That was behind my credenza when I was governor, when I was a congressman, and now it's in the West Wing of the White House. And it's one of those pictures your kids just don't like anymore because they're all so little and cute. (Laughter.) But I'll tell you, I just got one of them here, our wonderful daughter Audrey. But from that very first campaign when they were five, six, and seven, and we headed out to county fairs and started shaking hands, to this very day, these three and now our new wonderful daughter-in-law have held up my arms and kept their dad grounded and humble every step of the way. So, Audrey, Charlotte, Michael, thank you. (Applause.) I love you. (Applause.)\nAnd second-to-last, there's multiple tributes to the last person I will mention. The tie that I wear was designed by the First Lady of Indiana, and I thought it was the right tie to wear in this portrait. My wife Karen is an accomplished artist that during her years as First Lady of Indiana, she was an extraordinary champion not only for the arts but for children. She helped found the art therapy program at Riley Children's Hospital, and now she's made it an international cause as Second Lady of the United States. Her artwork around my neck is not the only tribute to my wife. She's featured in the photograph, of course, with the children.\nBut I'll tell you one other little secret. When Mark and Lynn came to Washington to take some pictures for this portrait, Mark had me leaning against something and arms folded, and I was completely uncomfortable. And Karen came down -- I think she must have sensed that things weren't going well. So she came downstairs and said, \"How's it going?\" And she stood behind Lynn as she was taking a picture, and she snapped a picture of me looking at my wife. It was just one. And when all the pictures came back, the consensus choice of everyone was the smile on Mike's face when he was looking at Karen. Thank you for putting that smile on my face. (Applause.) Thank you for bringing us here. (Applause.) Thank you for being the love of my life.\nAnd lastly, I want to give glory to God for the opportunities in my small life. It's incredibly humbling to me and hard to describe what it was like to step on to the floor of the Congress; what it was like the day I took my oath of office as the 50th governor; or what it was like to stand on that platform in January as the latest Hoosier Vice President. It is evidence -- interestingly, I think -- of exactly the verse that Pastor Vroegop prayed, a verse that I mentioned at that national convention, Governor Holcomb, that I often think, who am I, and who is my family that you brought me this far?\nAnd the little book to the right-hand side of me there is a copy of a well-worn Bible that sat on my desk as governor all throughout my years. It's the one I took my oath of office on, and I just wanted to make sure that, years from now, schoolkids might be passing through the governor's office, they might glance, and they might see in one portrait that we honored the people that we served and the flags that represent the state and the nation. That we honored our parents, without whom we would not be here. That we honored a family, without which we never would have spent a day in public service. And that we honored God and the foundation that he poured in our life and the sustaining grace that continues to support us this day.\nAnd so I thank you all for being here. Thank you for hearing my musings about this in this too emotional of a moment. In just a few hours, we'll head back to Washington, D.C. to continue to stand by a President who is making America great again every single day. (Applause.)\nBut as I leave, it just blesses our hearts to think that this portrait will be hanging where our hearts will always be, where the moon shines bright upon the Wabash. And until we come back home again, I pray that God will continue to bless the great state of Indiana and all who go by the name Hoosier.\nGod bless you all for being here, and God bless the United States of America.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=127982", "text": "Bridgewater Marriott\n5:07 P.M. EDT\nMS. DITTO: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos gave the President an update on the Trump administration's workforce development policies and apprenticeship initiative. The secretaries will each give remarks about their discussion with the President and will then take a few questions. Please keep your questions related to today's discussion on workforce development and apprenticeships.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Secretary Acosta.\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Thank you, and good afternoon. So let me just say, it's a pleasure to be here to update President Trump on the optimistic outlook of the American workforce.\nToday, we specifically discussed our process implementing the executive order on apprenticeships. The President's top priority in labor is jobs, more jobs, and even more jobs. And the Department of Labor is implementing the President's vision to ensure that Americans have the skills that they need to fill good, safe jobs.\nThere are 6.2 million job openings here nationwide. This is the highest number on record, yet 7 million Americans are looking for jobs. Americans want to work. American companies want to hire. We need to close the skills gap between those skills that are demanded by the workforce and those skills that are offered by the American people.\nThis is why the President signed this executive order to expand apprenticeships to all sectors of our economy. The concept of demand-driven education has been enthusiastically received by private industry, educational institutions, and state and local officials across the country. The CEOs of more than 100 major companies signed a joint letter in support of this executive order. And I should say, I've spoken with dozens of CEOs, college and university presidents, union leaders, and industry groups.\nTo a person, they are excited about apprenticeships. They're excited about this work, and are already starting to develop apprenticeship programs. We're currently evaluating hundreds of submissions that we have received in response to a call for nominations on the Apprenticeship Expansion Task Force. We expect the work of this task force to begin in September. They'll advise the administration on effective apprenticeship strategies for all industries.\nThe Department of Labor is partnering with industry groups, companies, nonprofit organizations, unions, joint labor management organizations, and so many others to help design these apprenticeship programs. Industry-recognized apprenticeships will teach workers skills that are transferable and portable within industries, resulting in even more job opportunities.\nFinally, I want to thank the President for his leadership on this effort, and I also want to thank Ivanka Trump and the Office of American Innovation for their tireless effort on this initiative.\nWorkforce education begins at our educational institutions. Students attend schools to become lifelong learners, but they also attend school to acquire the skills that lead to good, safe jobs with family-sustaining wages. Workforce education is a joint effort between the Department of Labor and the Department of Education.\nAnd so I want to thank Secretary DeVos for her partnership and her efforts. We're working hand-in-hand in this initiative, and she and I have attended so many events where she has spoken and I've spoken, because this really is an effort between the Department of Labor and the Department of Education. And so she's going to say a few words today.\nSECRETARY DEVOS: Thank you, Secretary Acosta. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd just like to say that we had a really productive discussion with the President this afternoon. This is a subject about which he is highly interested and about which many, many Americans care.\nFollowing the executive order in June, it was very clear the President really wants to see action in this area. And Secretary Acosta has just framed up some of the things that are underway right now. But I think it's important to remember that economics and our economies have changed dramatically in the last 50 years. Education needs to keep up. We need to update not only what we are teaching but also how we are teaching. We need to embrace innovation in our approaches to education.\nSchools are going to be beginning here very soon, and some actually have already, but the reality is that there are fewer traditional college students -- four-year college students. Many adults are going back to school to learn skills; many going back to change professions. I've met a number of these in my visits to schools in recent months. I think about the dance major who has now become a welder and loves her profession. I think about the court clerk who was bored with a desk job and went back and studied in the area of mechatronics and is now happily employed in advanced manufacturing in the aerospace industry.\nAs Secretary Acosta mentioned, there are more than 6 million jobs that are going unfilled currently. It's a mismatch on both skills, as well as geography. We really need to equip students with what they need to pursue these 21st century opportunities.\nAnd this is not limited to higher education, either. More can be done at the K-12 level. Students need to be able to understand and know the multiple pathways they have to a productive adult life, starting as early as middle school. And they need to have access to a variety of ways to learn these interesting subjects.\nSo I'll conclude with just saying that the administration's work in this area is going to help students first and foremost, but it's going to help communities, it's going to help our economy, and it ultimately will help our country.\nWith that, I think we are ready to take a couple of questions.\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Yes.\nQ: At some point, these priorities may need legislative approval, and I'm wondering if President Trump's comments about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will make that easier or more difficult in the future.\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Well, I'll say that this is an area that I think has broad-based support. If you look at -- there's so many ideas on the Hill around apprenticeship efforts. And it's an area that I think -- all legislators recognize that the American workforce deserves the best training and the best education available. We have 6.2 million open jobs. We have 7 million individuals who want to work. And I think there's broad recognition that we need to provide those individuals that want to work with access to the skills that is demanded by the modern workforce.\nSECRETARY DEVOS: And I would just add to that that I'm sure you're aware that the Perkins reauthorization passed the House with an overwhelming majority. In fact, it was as close to unanimous as you could come. And so I agree with Secretary Acosta that there's broad support for opportunities -- to expand opportunities for access to higher education and learning opportunities.\nQ: Thank you. Part of the President's initial executive order called for a review of how federal agencies could improve their training for apprenticeship programs. Can you talk a little about what a key finding or a few of the key findings were?\nAnd can you talk a little bit about -- I mean, obviously there's a lot of bipartisan support for apprenticeship programs. Are you feeling that play out? Are you reaching out to or have you had a number of Democratic lawmakers reach out to you to join with you in this effort?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Well, you're correct, there's support across the nation for apprenticeship programs. I have traveled to so many cities in the last month, and, to a person, I have heard support, I've heard excitement about apprenticeship programs.\nAs you mentioned, the executive order asked that each agency review its own programs to see how they can better support apprenticeship programs. And so, for example, the Department of Defense is going to be looking to see how they can better pipeline individuals that are leaving military service into apprenticeship programs. As we're working with several agencies and that review is underway.\nIn the front.\nQ: We've heard a lot today about the commitment to apprenticeship programs, but the President's budget actually calls for some pretty deep cuts to funding for states that would go for technical training, career training -- things like that. How do you square those two things up?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Actually, the President's budget maintains equal funding for apprenticeship programs and does not reduce it. But let me say, one of the points that I worry about sometimes in Washington is that we judge the success of a program by how much it spends. And we should judge the success of the program by how effective it is.\nAnd so if you look at apprenticeships, for example, in the building trades -- the building trades spend almost a billion a year of private sector money on apprenticeship programs. That's a success. The fact that they spend a billion a year of private sector money should be a complement and not a problem. And so, part of these apprenticeship programs --- and the key here -- is that we expect industry to be in charge, that industry should take the lead and should be paying for much of this training.\nAnd so, first, let me again reiterate, the President's budget does not reduce the spending on apprenticeship programs; it maintains level funding. But secondly, let's not judge a program by how much it spends, but by how effective it is.\nQ: And I was talking about funding in the education budget specifically.\nSECRETARY DEVOS: And actually, the CTE funding is relatively level compared to the year before, but the reality is that we're looking at ways that -- we're looking at programs that have been duplicative between agencies, and we are really searching for the way forward to support those that are effective and to do away with the things that are ineffective.\nAnd Secretary Acosta is absolutely right, the private sector has really stepped up in a major way and we need to partner with them in a much more intentional way to ensure that there are more and more opportunities that are meeting the needs of the jobs that exist.\nQ: The President has touted many times since he's taken office how great the jobs numbers are, his successes in creating jobs. Before he took office -- many, many times -- he called the unemployment numbers fiction and said those numbers were fake. How do you square those two things? What is his position now? Does he have confidence in the unemployment numbers, or has he changed his position to suit his politics?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Well, as you pointed out, there is a renewed spirit of optimism that has led to incredibly strong economic growth. Just since January, unemployment has fallen 0.5 percent to its lowest level in 16 years. U6 -- you referenced different measures -- U6, which is the broadest measure of unemployment, has fallen even further. It's fallen 0.8 percent. The stock market has hit high after high after high. Inflation figures just came out today, and they remain rather low -- 1.7 percent as of today, as opposed to 1.6 percent last month.\nAnd so you have confidence and optimism that is, again, among job creators, reaching levels that we haven't seen in many, many years. And I guess I should just say, if you look at the jobs numbers just since January, more than 1,070,000 jobs have been created.\nNow, as you point out, there are several measures of unemployment. Actually, the Bureau of Labor Statistics puts out at least six measures of unemployment -- U1 through U6 -- each focused on a different measure and each getting progressively broader. I would simply reiterate that the standard measure that we usually talk about that's at 4.3 percent has fallen 0.5. But the broader measure, which you reference, which the President has referenced at times, has fallen even further by 0.8 percent, which, in six months, is rather a stunning decrease.\nQ: I'm sorry, just to be clear, does the President have confidence in the numbers that come out of the Department of Labor? And why did he previously call them fake?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: And so I'm here to tell you what the numbers that come out of the Department of Labor are. I would leave it to him to comment further. But let me say this: I think the President has talked about the job figures, and he has pointed out how incredibly strong they are. We have a renewed spirit of optimism that has led to economic growth, and let's just look at the numbers that have come out of Bureau of Labor Statistics month after month after month. Unemployment is down 0.5 percent, the U3 number to 4.3. It's a 16-year low. The U6 number is down 0.8 percent.\nAnd so this data -- and it is data -- shows incredible economic growth and we should focus on the growth that we see in this economy.\nSECRETARY DEVOS: Let me just add to what Secretary Acosta said in that we can acknowledge, at the same time, that there are too many Americans that have decided to leave the labor market and are not looking for a job, and we want to ensure opportunities for them to realize everything that they can actually be and have paths and avenues to good work, and to have opportunities that have heretofore not been afforded them.\nA lot of the messaging that's been sent the last couple of decades has been that, if you do not attend a 4-year college or university, you are less-than. And this is a very different approach that we have in this administration -- to reach out and to say: All of you are needed and all of you are important parts of our society and parts of our country.\nAnd this apprenticeship program, this apprenticeship focus, and the focus on multiple pathways to higher education is a really, really important effort to better engage a greater swath of our population.\nQ: You're both here at a time when the President is also dealing with issues related to foreign policy. That came up in the meeting that you had today. As two members of his Cabinet, did he share with you any of the larger concerns that he's dealing with now, or read you in at all on the U.S. position related to what's happening with North Korea right now?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: So, I would say from my perspective, the President was focused on the American workforce, on how to create jobs. And he wants to see, as I said earlier, jobs, more jobs, and even more jobs. This is something he cares very passionate about. He comes from the construction industry and is very familiar with the success of the building trades in creating apprenticeships, and he wants to see this expanded across all industries.\nSECRETARY DEVOS: Yeah, he's focused on opportunities -- opportunities for all Americans.\nQ: So as members of the Cabinet, though, he doesn't discuss these larger issues that I realize are not your direct area of responsibility? But as members of the team --\nSECRETARY DEVOS: Not in the context of our meeting today.\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Thank you very much.\nQ: Thanks for coming.\nSECRETARY DEVOS: Thank you.\nEND 5:23 P.M.

But I bring greetings today from the man who made that service possible, whose confidence and the confidence of the American people landed me in this position. I bring greetings this morning from a great admirer of the people of Indiana and a great champion of America's inner cities, the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nI'm here today as a fellow Hoosier and on behalf of our President simply to say thank you. Thank you to all of you from the bottom of our hearts for investing in the Ten Point Coalition with your time and your talent and your treasure -- now for more than two decades -- and for believing in this community and in the extraordinary potential of this community to set an example for the nation.\nNow, the Old Book tells us that if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. And I'm just here today as a fellow Hoosier to pay a debt of gratitude to all of you -- all of you involved in this organization, members of the board, volunteers, and contributors who made such an extraordinary difference in the lives of our fellow Hoosiers. And the Ten Point Coalition is not only going to be inspiring cities across Indiana. I promise you, it will continue to inspire cities and communities across the United States of America. (Applause.)\nAnd let me add my congratulations to the three recipients that we just met of the Neighborhood Crime Prevention Award. Was the term \"OG\" I thought I heard, Reverend Harrison? (Laughter.) I call them heroes. Heroes who have had the courage to put feet on their faith to help their neighbors. Can we give one more round of applause to Darryl Jones, Donny Reynolds, and Wallace Nash, these are inspiring men who are pouring themselves into the lives of young people. (Applause.)\nAnd finally, let me thank one of my heroes -- a humble man himself whose visionary leadership and inspiring faith you can see in those statistics and you know in your hearts has made Indianapolis and Indiana a safer place -- the founder and president of the Indianapolis Ten Point Coalition, my friend, Reverend Charles Harrison. (Applause.) Reverend, thank you so much for your witness and for your leadership. You can get on your feet for him if you want one more time. (Applause.) I know Reverend Harrison well. We became friends some time ago, and I know the only part of this event that he doesn't like is that. (Laughter.) Thank you so much for your witness, for your faith, and your example.\nIt's remarkable to think about everything the Ten Point Coalition has accomplished since its founding in this city about 20 years ago. You brought Indianapolis together in common cause -- law enforcement, faith leaders, local businesses, government officials, all in evidence today, families, and local residents -- all for one common purpose, and that is to tackle the violent crime and the lack of opportunities for young people in our cities. And all of you involved in the board, all of you involved as volunteers in the Ten Point Coalition have been literally shining the light of God's love and hope into some of the most challenging places in our city. You've literally been the hands and feet of our Lord, and I thank you for that.\nIt was only 13 months ago that Karen and I had the privilege to put on those bright neon yellow vests ourselves, and we walked with Reverend Harrison and an evening group in what they call the faith patrol through some neighborhoods on the Near Northside. It was an experience Karen and I will always remember. It was a very, very special time.\nWe came just a few weeks before our lives would be turned upside down and we'd be swept into a national campaign. But it was still among one of the most meaningful moments of the year 2016 for my wife and I. As we walked those streets, we heard stories. We heard stories from families of sorrow and resolve; we heard of stories of redemption and second chances. We saw firsthand, really, the power of love and faith to heal the wounds of division and distrust that set us apart from our neighbors and friends. And most of all, Karen and I saw a program that literally, every day, works miracles in the evening hours of the streets of Indianapolis. That's the Ten Point Coalition. (Applause.)\nAnd there's no doubt the Ten Point Coalition is succeeding in saving lives in Indianapolis. You just heard the statistics, but they're worth repeating. Last year alone, the Coalition helped reduce homicides by 85 percent in three communities that they serve -- Butler-Tarkington, Crown-Hill, and the Northwest Area. It's an extraordinary accomplishment, and it deserves another round of applause for these heroes who have been out taking personal risk to change lives. (Applause.)\nIn recognition of their success, I'm pleased to report the Federal Bureau of Investigation awarded the Coalition, its directors, the Community Leadership Award, and it was so well deserved. And just two days ago, I was so glad to learn that our attorney general, Curtis Hill, has announced a new grant program to that will help to expand the Ten Point Coalition to cities all across Indiana. Mr. Attorney General, thank you for your vision and your leadership in bringing solutions that work to the other 91 counties of our state. (Applause.)\nThe Ten Point Coalition truly is an inspiration to us all. Your leaders and volunteers really embody those timeless values of commitment to faith and neighbor and family and community, of charity and duty to country and selfless service that's really what Indiana is known for all around America. So I just want to thank each one you for the life-saving, life-changing work that you've been involved in every day.\nAnd make no mistake about it, I can tell you -- and I talked about it this morning -- the Ten Point Coalition and all of you who feel called to confront the challenge of urban youth violence, you have an ally, an advocate, and a champion in President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nOur administration, under the President's direction, has already demonstrated our commitment to renewing opportunity and restoring public safety to our cities using those same engagement ideals of the Ten Point Coalition. In one of his first acts as President after taking the oath of office, the President issued an executive order to create the first-ever Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety, with the goal of fostering collaboration between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and to improve the safety of our police officers and the safety of the citizens that they serve.\nAnd just two months ago, I was pleased to join Attorney General Jeff Sessions to launch the National Public Safety Partnership between the Department of Justice and just 12 cities across the United States of America. And I was proud that one of those cities that stood out and earned that support was the city of Indianapolis. And, Mayor Joe Hogsett, I offer you my congratulations. (Applause.)\nThis new initiative will provide additional resources to empower cities to identify the best tools and the best strategies to take on gangs, to take on the drug dealers, and take back their cities from the scourge of violent crime.\nAnd I want to not only commend the mayor, but also your chief of police, Bryan Roach. This is a great team and we are committed at the federal level to working with Indianapolis to continue the progress that you've made under your leadership. So, thank you. ((Applause.)\nAnd while we speak of those in law enforcement, let me take a moment just to express my deepest sympathies -- deepest sympathies to the family of Deputy Police Chief Jim Waters, who passed away just a few short weeks ago. The Good Book tells us that the Lord is close to the broken-hearted, and I know I speak for all of us gathered here, and all across our city and our state, when I say that your deputy chief will be missed. We will cherish and honor his service always, and we express our condolences to his family.\nIn fact, before I go one step further, you know, there's an awful lot of members of the law enforcement community who are with us here today -- state and federal officials and people that stand every day on the thin blue line, protecting our families. Would all mind getting on your feet and just showing these law enforcement officers how much we truly appreciate the sacrifices and risks they take each and every day to keep us safe? (Applause.)\nLet me also say that President Trump, as he demonstrated yesterday, is committed to addressing a crisis that has hit close to home here in Indiana and in states, really, all across the heartland -- the scourge of opioid addiction. I want to thank Governor Holcomb for his aggressive efforts in this regard.\nAnd just yesterday, I was pleased to join the President at Bedminster, as he directed our entire administration to use all appropriate emergency and other authorities to respond to the crisis of an opiate epidemic. President Donald Trump yesterday declared a national health emergency to confront opiate addiction and abuse in America, and we're going to partner with our states to bring hope and healing to families. (Applause.)\nAnd President Trump has been working to keep his promise to make America safe again. But our President also knows that we can't just arrest our way back to public safety. We've got to create opportunities for people. And in that sense, the Ten Point Coalition has been ahead of its time, understanding that it's not just about having faith patrols on the streets and working with local law enforcement; it's about making sure that our young people have better choices.\nThat's why our administration has been fighting every day to get this economy moving again. We've already taken decisive action to rein in the heavy hand of government so that job creators can expand their workforces and the American people can find and seize opportunities they need to climb the ladder of success. You heard Fanchon describe some of the progress in the economy, and you can feel it all across America, I can tell you.\nWhether it's regulation, energy, trade, or taxes -- you name it -- this President is taking action, and our communities can feel the difference every single day. Businesses, large and small, have literally created more than one million new jobs since the first of this year. More Americans are working now than ever before. Unemployment hasn't been this low in 16 years, and African American unemployment is at a 17-year low. (Applause.)\nAnd we're not just fighting to put America back to work. President Trump is also committed to fighting to restore the dignity of all work -- an issue that I worked on during my years as governor, and Governor Holcomb has been expanding greatly on in the tenure of his administration. Our administration will continue to work with Indiana and states around the country to ensure that every American, young and old, has the opportunity to develop the skills they need to succeed in the careers of their choosing.\nThe President actually signed an executive order to expand apprenticeships and vocational training in the skilled trades. And I'm so glad to see Sue Ellspermann, my former lieutenant governor and the great president of Ivy Tech here, making a great, great difference in community college education here in the Hoosier State. (Applause.)\nBut, you know, the Ten Point Coalition has understood the importance of vocational training since its very inception -- bringing together communities and families and employers. In fact, when we walk the streets with the Ten Point Coalition, Reverend Harrison asked me if I had a little more time that night, and I said, of course, I did. When the faith patrol finished, we ended up at Reiss Welding, just up near 38th Street. It's a great company right here in Indianapolis. Reiss Welding has actually been partnering with the coalition to hire ex-offenders in the community and give them the training and the skills they need to get back on their feet.\nThat night, I talked with more than a few of them. It was kind of hard to get us out of the place. I was so inspired by the owners that were putting their faith in not only the Ten Point Coalition, but in these men with transformed lives who have chosen a better path and they've determined to give them an opportunity to live out that path.\nI heard from those same men about how grateful they were to have been given a second chance. It was a God-send for each and every one of them. So why don't we just take a moment to thank Reiss Welding, who are represented here today, I know, and all the businesses who partner with Ten Point Coalition to open doors of opportunity for our young people all across this city. It's making a difference. Let's give them a round of applause. (Applause.)\nYou know, it's remarkable to think that an amazing 90 percent of apprentices get jobs after they finish a program. Their average salary is an impressive $60,000 a year. These jobs are a solid foundation for a good life and a brighter future. And as President Trump has said, we're going to, in his words, help all Americans find a rewarding career, earn a great living, and be able support themselves and their families with better access to vocational education and training.\nAnd our administration is also committed to enacting bold reforms in our welfare system. We're seeking every day to move people from welfare to work, from dependency to opportunity.\nAs the Ten Point Coalition knows, too many of our federal programs seem to undermine the very institutions in our society that create a foundation for prosperity and opportunity.\nThe result is a heartbreaking cycle of poverty and despair. I believe, and the President believes, if we're serious about helping the most vulnerable among us, it's not enough just to provide shelter from the cold; we also have a responsibility to help them find a pathway out of poverty and into greater opportunity for themselves and their families. (Applause.) And under the President's leadership, our administration is going to be working with the Congress to reform our welfare programs to achieve that goal -- to move people from welfare to work.\nLater this fall, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Dr. Ben Carson, who was just in Indiana a few days ago, will unveil a new initiative of private and public partnerships that will empower the neediest among us to develop the skills and confidence they need to compete for today's jobs, climb the ladder of success, and fulfill their God-given potential. We believe this initiative, and in the midst of all the others, will help transform public housing into springboards for upward mobility. And we look forward to working with the city of Indianapolis and with the state of Indiana to make that a reality in the Hoosier state.\nThe truth is we can't solve poverty from Washington, DC. Our administration believes in bottom-up approach that will empower local problem-solvers like all of you, and like all the officials that are gathered here, to do what you do best.\nSo as we continue to develop these reforms, I urge you to stay engaged, to bring those great ideas forward to the city of Indianapolis, to the state of Indiana, and know that our administration will continue to work very carefully to study the progress that Indiana is making and to be able to export Indiana's success all across this country.\nSo let me just say, as I wrap up today, I want to -- I came here today to express my appreciation. All of the actions and initiatives that I've mentioned are tremendously important for our administration and the millions of people that will benefit from them. But, truly, to restore an America where anyone can succeed, no matter where they are and where they live, we have to ultimately remember that we start with our kids, with the education that they receive.\nThe President has said eloquently that, in his words, that \"education is the civil rights issue of our time.\" And he's made it clear that our administration will not rest until we open the doorway to a world-class education for every child in every city in America. (Applause.)\nThe Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, who I met with earlier this week, is hard at work reforming federal education policies to give states like Indiana even more flexibility, to be able to enact real reforms that gives students and parents even more choices.\nWe believe that every student deserves access to a world-class education, regardless of their income or their area code. And we'll continue to support efforts all across the country and to expand educational choices like you've developed here in Indiana for more and more children. I promise you that.\nMy friends, I can assure you we have a President, and this a White House, that is deeply committed to the vision and the values that bring us here today. We're fighting every day to extend opportunity to those who don't have it, to restore peace to the communities that have experienced too little of it of late, and to bring hope and an opportunity for a future to those who so desperately need it.\nThe policies that I've discussed today will continue to make a difference in the lives of countless Americans. But as the Ten Point Coalition knows at its core, the most important work we'll ever do will take place not in the marbled halls of Washington, D.C. or in the State House or in city hall here in Indianapolis. The truth is, the real work is going to be done by people like all of you. It's going to be done in the hearts and minds of our neighbors who take it upon themselves to take ownership to not only revive our economy, but to revive the commitment of each of us, one another to our neighbor. That's the pathway to public safety. That's the pathway to prosperity.\nAnd so today, as I close, I would just challenge all of you who support and are involved in the Ten Point Coalition to keep it up, keep doing what you're doing each and every day. As the Good Book says, \"Do not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap a harvest of blessing, if we do not give up.\"\nSo, men and women and volunteers of the Ten Point Coalition, do not grow weary, do not give up. Have faith in God. Have faith in this community and in the great people of the state of Indiana. And the work that you do here at the Indianapolis Ten Point Coalition will continue to change this community, change communities all over the state of Indiana, and it will inspire the nation.\nSo thank you for your work. God bless the Ten Point Coalition, the great state of Indiana, and God bless the United States of America.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128307", "text": "Via Teleconference\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The Vice President is traveling to South and Central America, as my colleague said, to visit Colombia, Argentina, Chile, and Panama. These are four key partners and friends of the United States and each in their own way are emblematic of a positive direction that we've seen in Latin America -- open markets, strong democracies.\nThe Vice President will meet with President Santos in Colombia, visit with President Macri in Argentina, Bachelet in Chile, and Varela in Panama. And many of these, he's either joined the President here in the White House or hosted in the West Wing, and also had phone calls. So looking forward to reengaging with those four key leaders.\nWe're going to further our close economic and security ties. We'll express to all four the support for important economic reform efforts across the region, and, again, share concerns with the disturbing collapse of democracy in Venezuela that I'm sure will be raised in all the stops.\nHoning down a little bit in each country -- in Colombia, our visit to Cartagena will highlight our strong bilateral ties with Colombia. That includes our support for the country's efforts to address some serious challenges of implementing its peace accords. They are reducing historic levels of drug cultivation which was at an all-time high. And we'll also highlight our significant trade and investment relationships. You'll see that theme through all four stops. Underpinning our bilateral trade promotion agreement that's been in place since 2012.\nThe Vice President is also going to underscore the helpful role Colombia is playing to increase pressure on the Maduro regime. He's going to call on Colombia to continue to take actions against the Maduro regime and assist with other regional actors to do the same.\nThen, as my colleague said, we'll transit to Argentina. In Argentina, the Vice President is going to highlight President Macri's bold reform agenda, the reemergence of Argentina into a position of global leadership. They'll be hosting -- Argentina will be hosting the WTO ministerial later this year. And I'm certain you'll hear from President Macri -- they're hosting the G20 in 2018, which is huge for them and for us, as well.\nThe Vice President will also deliver, as my colleague said, a major policy address in Buenos Aires. We'll outline a vision of productive engagement with likeminded partners across the region. And we'll talk about our shared commitments to security, to prosperity, and to democracy.\nWe'll then fly down to Chile. We'll recognize Chile as a leader and a model for open and integrated economy, their solid, stable democracy. We'll highlight our successes of our trade relationship, the free trade agreements, and a robust security partnership. And as my colleague mentioned, we'll also highlight the 50th anniversary of the Association of U.S. Chambers in Latin America and the 100th anniversary of the American Chamber there in Chile -- a very historical time for that organization. He'll address that in his speech with U.S. business community leaders. He'll note the positive legacy that our U.S. businesses have in the region, and recommit everyone to fighting corruption and building transparency in the region.\nAnd then our last stop in Panama, the Vice President is going to continue to talk about our bilateral commercial and security relationships. We'll highlight the role of our new successful free trade agreement with Panama. As my colleague said, he will tour at the historic Miraflores Lock and then the new expanded Cocoli Lock. And we'll talk about the historic connection and, really, the past, but more so looking at the future and the future that we're going to build with them in the region.\nAnd as my colleague mentioned, I would imagine in each of these stops we'll talk about Venezuela. All of these countries have demonstrated their clear support for democracy, rejecting the dictatorship of Maduro's regime. A note that the Declaration of Lima -- I believe that was, gosh, a couple days ago now, on the 8th -- 12 countries from the region expressed unanimous support for democracy in Venezuela, and we'll reaffirm that with each of our stops.\nSo I'll keep it at that so we can go to some questions. Thanks, everybody.\nQ: Hey. So on Venezuela, obviously, yeah, I imagine that's going to be a big theme. Is there anything, I guess, new that you think can be added to the conversation beyond sort of reaffirming support? Any additional sanctions that could be discussed? Yeah, I guess if you could just give a little more color, sort of like what new or what more might be added on that issue.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, so the important piece with these four countries is it's a multilateral approach, a regional approach. We've been firm in both word and deed against the Maduro regime, and it's important to get others in the region. And these four countries have, but we want to continue to put the pressure on the Maduro regime. We'll talk to economic options, diplomatic options -- every tool that's available. It's not only the United States putting forth pressure on Maduro, but that he's getting it from all sides of the region as well.\nQ: And one last thing. Any trade deals you expect? I don't know if there was anything, you know, like trade announcements that might be made along the way.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, we anticipate there will be a couple announcements made along the way. We've been working hard with partners and both with Commerce and USTR, and the Vice President will be making a couple announcements while we're there in region.\nQ: Okay, great. Thank you.\nQ: Are you anticipating any additional sanctions against Venezuela to be announced during the time that we're there?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: You know, we've got a full range of options available. And obviously, the National Security Council and interagency worked hard to lay out options for the President. I would never want to project our moves for the administration, but we're working through a range of options to give to the President.\nQ: In terms of trade, is there going to be any talk about the -- there's like the TPP-minus-one that's sort of developing with some of these countries. Is that going to be a topic of discussion?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Trade will be a topic of discussion in all of the stops. We've had good engagements with the leaders, again, during their visits here, and we'll build upon the previous conversations and working with their teams. But absolutely would anticipate bilateral trade discussions with each of these countries.\nQ: Can you actually just tell us a little bit about whether the Vice President has ever been to any of these countries before? And just talk a little bit more about the relationship -- if he has any beyond just the meetings while the leaders were visiting the White House -- whether he has any past relationships with these leaders.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can only speak during the time with the administration; he hasn't traveled to the region. I'd have to get back and check on what he did in his time as governor and, I would anticipate, during his time with the Foreign Affairs Committee. But again, I'd have to go back and verify. But during his time as Vice President, he has not been to the region.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, we'll take that as a follow-up on that one. He has met with some of these leaders as they've come to the White House, so that's probably the most recent interaction.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Absolutely, yep. He has hosted -- he has visits on his own and with the President.\nQ: And just a question if this is happening during this brinksmanship, if you will, over North Korea. And I'm curious if you anticipate the Vice President to address the situation in the Korean Peninsula at all, or if that will be a subject of any of the talks.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: You know, the Vice President talks to the President every day. This is obviously at the forefront with our administration and national security. So I would imagine it will be raised. It is a global problem that requires a global solution. With the range of ICBM, it's not just North America that has these concerns. So, if raised, we're ready to address, and it's not leaving the radar screen just because we're leaving the time zone.\nQ: You talked about a major policy announcement in Argentina. Now you have a country like Colombia and Chile that have a positive trade balance. The U.S. has a positive trade balance with them. That would be an issue. What about immigration? How will you bring immigration about this trip? And how will you be able to avoid Venezuela overshadowing the rest of the message of this very long visit of the Vice President to Latin America?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, I'll address the latter half first. It's relevant to us and it's relevant to the four countries that we're visiting. So I don't see it as a distractor; I see it as an important discussion point as we talk about the multilateral approach. I guess the parallelism I would make is, during our trip to Asia, North Korea did a test when we were in country there, and it obviously didn't distract from the relationship with the host countries. It's, again, a global problem that requires a global solution. And so I would imagine that will get raised.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I would just chime in on that. I actually think that what the situation in Venezuela demonstrates is the divide between the future of South America and the past of South America. And that will be a theme that will be highlighted throughout the trip, is that Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Panama -- they represent the future -- the future of freedom, opportunity, prosperity, trade, growth, whereas Venezuela is going into the past of dictatorship, oppression. And these other countries that we are highlighting, we're highlighting them because of the relationship and the steps to move forward that they have made. So I think that will be a theme you'll see throughout the trip. So the events that are happening will play into that as well.\nSo do you want to take the other part of the question?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah. can you just refresh?\nQ: Yeah, immigration.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yep. We've had the discussions here. We had the discussions with -- we've hosted President Macri, President Santos, Varela. He hasn't had the opportunity to meet Bachelet, but we'll address it. Again, it's important to this administration. We're going to talk about how the importance of a good, solid economy and trade keeps economic migrants from fleeing if they can have jobs. And we're going to talk about any corruption and, again, how we can keep the folks back in their homes. Most of the folks -- most of the immigration issues have not generated from these four particular countries, but they have, again, the regional influence, as we discussed when the Vice President hosted down in Miami at the Northern Triangle Conference, on some of the immediate areas.\nSo it will be discussed more in a \"how can they support the region\" and less of immigration proper -- because with these particular countries, they're not leaders in that.\nQ: In a follow-up, any concern on Argentina? You have their primary elections this weekend. They don't define much but they define a lot. And the Vice President will arrive right after. Will this have an impact? And will there be kind of a message of his support for Macri?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, no -- the timing -- we realize that we're coming in the day after, but he had a good meeting with President Macri here at the White House when the President hosted President Macri. And we look forward to building upon that relationship.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Anybody else?\nQ: In previous administrations we've seen Presidents ask their Vice President to take on Latin America -- not quite as a special dossier. But we've seen Vice Presidents in the past develop very close relationships not just with their (inaudible), but also with heads of state, heads of government. Has President Trump asked the Vice President to make sure that Latin America gets enough attention? Because it's a time on with what's going on in the world.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, I mean, the President has asked the Vice President, and that's why he is going on this trip. It's important to this administration and that's why we were given the direction from the President to head down.\nQ: But more specifically, you saw -- I don't want to mention previous Vice Presidents by name to kind of upset everyone, but it's kind of been like an area of specialty for some of these previous Vice Presidents. To take on Latin America is something -- it's their kind of dossier. Is there a sense that that's part of Vice President Pence's role, to pay special attention to Latin America?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: (Inaudible) special attention to the globe. That's what I've seen as the national security advisor in just a few short months. The President has asked him to go to Europe, to Asia; we just got back from Eastern Europe, the Baltics, and the Balkans, and now to Latin America. It's important to the President and this administration that we get the message out globally, and the Vice President is looking forward to being part of that.\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: One of the things we'll also talk about is the fact that the United States exports more to the Western Hemisphere than all of Asia combined, and the Vice President will get into that in a little more specificity in some of his remarks. But that will be something we'll highlight.\nOne other thing I should clarify when I was talking a little bit about the theme: Just to note, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Panama are representing the future of Latin America. I might have said South America, but obviously we're including Central America in that, as well. So, I apologize -- the future of Latin America.", "timestamp": "2017-08-11", "title": "Background Press Call by Senior Administration Officials on the Vice President's Trip to Latin America"}

Alexander Acosta; Secretary of Education Elisabeth P. DeVos; and Chairman of the Korean Worker's Party Kim Jong Un of North Korea.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=127981", "text": "The President. Thank you Secretary Acosta and Secretary DeVos for joining us today. And thank you all, because we are—we have been working very hard on being sure that Americans have the training they need for the jobs in the future. I also want to thank Ivanka, my daughter, for her leadership on workforce training and her efforts. She's been working very, very hard to create new economic opportunities for women across America and, actually, for women across the world. She's been working with the Chancellor of Germany on helping women all over the world.\nIn the past 7 months, we've made enormous gains in getting Americans back to work. The stock market is at record highs. Unemployment is at a 16-year low. And manufacturers have never expressed more optimism about the future. The optimism has been truly incredible.\nRecently, Foxconn announced that it's going to invest $10 billion to build a new factory in Wisconsin. We want to make sure that every job that comes back to our shores is filled with American workers. We have a lot of companies moving back to our country. You're probably seeing that. Two major automobile companies just announced they're moving back to the United States, and they're going to build major plants. They're looking for the site. They're putting it out to 7 or 8 different States, and they're going to be very happy building in the United States. It's going to work out very well for them.\nThat's why, in June, we began a historic initiative to expand apprenticeship and workforce training programs in all industries. We're expanding pathways to success. So important. And apprenticeships are one of the many avenues that lead to the great jobs, completely debt free. And who knows more about the word \"apprentice\" than Donald Trump? [Laughter]\nIn fact, under the apprenticeship, you earn while you learn. So important and so great. And you love getting up in the morning and going to work, and a lot of great things involved here.\nWe're also here today to discuss additional steps we will be taking to expand apprenticeship programs, especially for women and minorities in STEM fields where women have been truly underrepresentative—really, I guess you could say, underrepresented for many, many decades.\nTechnology has become a part of nearly every industry, from manufacturing to retail. And we want all of our citizens, every single citizen—including women and minorities—to have access to high-paying tech jobs and other STEM-related jobs. American workers are the best there is anywhere in the world, and we're finding work for them. They built the skyscrapers of our cities, the roads and bridges across our land—and we'll be building plenty of new roads and bridges, by the way—the technology that has revolutionized the globe, and so much more, as you're well aware.\nTheir skills, talent, and grit have always put America on top. And we're going to remain on top, but at a much higher level than we are right now. And speaking of now, it is our job to make sure that they have the training, immediately, to lead us into the future. We have great, great hope. We have a great, great future in this country. There's never been more optimism. And again, unemployment at a 16-year low.\nSo we're honored to have all of you. Mr. Secretary, thank you very much. Betsy, thank you very much. We appreciate it. And, Ivanka, congratulations on working so hard.\nAssistant to the President Ivanka M. Trump. Thank you.\nThe President. We really do appreciate it. Thank you.\nAny questions?\nNorth Korea\nQ. Mr. President, what did you mean by \"military solutions\" are \"locked and loaded\" as it relates to North Korea?\nThe President. Well, I think it's pretty obvious. We are looking at that very carefully, and I hope that they are going to fully understand the gravity of what I said. And what I said is what I mean. So, hopefully, they'll understand, Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News], exactly what I said and the meaning of those words. Those words are very, very easy to understand.\nQ. Any progress on the diplomatic backchannel?\nThe President. Well, we don't want to talk about progress; we don't want to talk about backchannels. We want to talk about a country that has misbehaved for many, many years—decades, actually—through numerous administrations. And they didn't want to take on the issue, and I have no choice but to take it on, and I'm taking it on. And we'll either be very, very successful quickly, or we're going to be very, very successful in a different way, quickly.\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany\nQ. Angela Merkel says she sees no military solution to a fight with North Korea. Why is she wrong?\nThe President. Well, I think maybe she's speaking for Germany. Let her speak for Germany. She's a friend of mine; she's a very good person, a very good woman. She's a friend of Ivanka. Perhaps she's referring to Germany. She's certainly not referring to the United States, that I can tell you.\nNorth Korea\nQ. Mr. President, you've said you want to send a strong message to North Korea. What do you say to your critics who say that your rhetoric is actually raising the tension?\nThe President. Well, you know, my critics are only saying that because it's me. If somebody else uttered the exact same words that I uttered, they'd say, \"What a great statement, what a wonderful statement.\" They're only doing it—but I will tell you, we have tens of millions of people in this country that are so happy with what I'm saying, because they're saying, finally we have a President that's sticking up for our Nation and, frankly, sticking up for our friends and our allies.\nAnd this man will not get away with what he's doing, believe me. And if he utters one threat, in the form of an overt threat—which, by the way, he has been uttering for years, and his family has been uttering for years—or if he does anything with respect to Guam or anyplace else that's an American Territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it, and he will regret it fast. Okay? Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-08-11", "title": "Remarks Prior to a Meeting on Workforce Development and Apprenticeship Programs and an Exchange With Reporters in Bedminster, New Jersey"}

Calvo of Guam.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128035", "text": "The President. Thank you, everybody. We had a very good meeting. We talked about North Korea, as you can imagine. We're very much in agreement, I think we are very unified, and we have been right from the beginning: This is something that has to stop. We all feel that very strongly.\nI will be speaking to President Xi tonight, from China. And we've been working very closely with China and with other countries. That phone call will take place tonight.\nSo if you have any questions, go ahead.\nSouth Korea/North Korea/Japan\nQ. Mr. President, what have you been able to do to reassure South Korea given the recent tensions?\nThe President. Well, I think as far as reassurance, they probably feel as reassured as they can feel. Certainly, they feel more reassured with me than they do with other Presidents from the past, because nobody has really done the job that they're supposed to be doing. And that's why we're at this horrible situation right now. And it is a very bad situation. It's a very dangerous situation. And it will not continue, that I can tell you.\nSo I think South Korea is very happy. And you don't mention Japan, but I think Japan is very happy with the job we're doing. I think they're very impressed with the job that we're doing, and let's see how it turns out.\nRussia's Expulsion of U.S. Diplomatic Personnel\nQ. Mr. President, were you being sarcastic when you thanked Vladimir Putin for expelling 755 diplomats from Russia?\nThe President. In order to reduce our payroll, absolutely. I think you know that. I think you knew that.\nQ. So—[inaudible]?\nThe President. We'll see. In fact, I was just speaking to the Secretary, and we're talking about coming up with an answer. When, Rex? Tell me.\nSecretary Tillerson. By September 1.\nThe President. By September 1 we'll have a response. But we have reduced payroll very substantially.\nYes.\nNorth Korea Q. Mr. President, a lot of Americans are on edge with this rhetoric going back and forth between the United States and North Korea. What can you tell them? What do you tell them——\nThe President. You know what I can say? Hopefully, it will all work out. Okay? Nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump. That I can tell you. Hopefully, it will all work out. But this has been going on for many years. It would have been a lot easier to solve this years ago before they were in the position that they're in. But we will see what happens. We think that lots of good things could happen, and we could also have a bad solution. But we think lots of good things can happen.\nQ. What would be a bad solution, sir?\nThe President. I think you know the answer to that.\nNorth Korea\nQ. But tell us more, Mr. President, please, when you say bad solutions, are you talking about war? Is the U.S. going to go to war?\nThe President. I think you know the answer to that.\nIran\nQ. Is Iran abiding by the nuclear agreement, in your view?\nThe President. Well, we have some pretty strong opinions, but I would say that they are certainly not abiding by the spirit of the agreement. And I'd go a further—really, a further step, but I would say that the spirit of the agreement, Iran is not abiding by. Absolutely.\nAfghanistan/Venezuela\nQ. Staying in that region, do you have the right generals in place right now for the fight in Afghanistan?\nThe President. Well, we're going to make a determination, Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News], in a very short period of time as to Afghanistan. I've been looking at it. It's our longest war in history, 17 years. That's unacceptable. We will be making decisions, as you know, very well. And we're looking at that very closely. We talked about it a little bit today. We talked about Venezuela today also, by the way. Venezuela is a mess; it's a very dangerous mess and a very sad situation. But we talked about Venezuela also.\nWhite House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly/The President's Accomplishments\nQ. We're a couple weeks into General John Kelly's time as your Chief of Staff. What have you done differently? What has he done to change the way you act or perhaps in the way that your White House acts?\nThe President. Well, I think General Kelly has done a fantastic job. He's a respected person, respected by everybody. Things have come together very nicely.\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. And I have to say, I think probably—and I've gone through this a lot—but I think very, very few Presidents have done what we've done in a 6-month period: whether its optimism in business, whether it's the stock market, whether it's picking up $4 trillion in value with companies and equity, whether it's all of the many things—including a Supreme Court Justice, regulations being cut massively. We have, I think, it's 48 bills being passed in the Legislature—I'm talking about Legislature, not just Executive orders.\nI think few have done anywhere near what we've done, and we'll work now on tax reform cuts. We'll never stop working on, as you know, health care. That's also working. And we're working on other things, including infrastructure. We're going to have a very big infrastructure bill. So I think nobody has done—very rarely could I that anybody has done—I'm not sure that anybody has done what we've done in a 6-month period.\nBut I think that General Kelly has brought a tremendous—he's brought something very special to the office of Chief—I call him \"Chief.\" He's a respected man. He's a four-star from the Marines, and he carries himself like a four-star from the Marines. And he's my friend, which is very important.\nSenate Majority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell/Health Care Reform Legislation\nQ. Mr. President, a number of Republican Senators have rushed to the defense of Senate Majority Leader McConnell in the last day or so. What do you make of that? And have you reached out to——\nThe President. I don't make anything of it. We should have had health care approved. He should have known that he had a couple of votes that turned on him, and that should have been very easy to handle, whether it's through the fact that you take away a committee chairmanship or do whatever you have to do.\nBut what happened, in my opinion, last week is unacceptable. People have been talking about repeal and replace for 7 years, long before I ever decided to be doing what I'm doing. Seven years, they've been talking repeal and replace, and it didn't happen. And it not only didn't happen, it was a surprise, and it was a horrible surprise. And it was very unfair to the Republican Party and very unfair to the people of this country. So I was not impressed.\nNow, can he do good? I think so. I think we can do very well on taxes, cuts, reform. I think we're going to do well on infrastructure. And things will happen with respect to health care, and I think things will happen maybe outside of necessarily needing Congress, because there are things that I can do as President that will have a huge impact on health care. So you watch. Stay tuned.\nGuam/North Korea\nQ. Have you spoken to the Governor of Guam? And what did you tell him?\nThe President. No, I have not. But I feel that they will be very safe. Believe me, they will be very safe. And if anything happens to Guam, there's going to big, big trouble in North Korea.\nU.S. Military Strategy\nQ. Have you ordered any change in our military readiness?\nThe President. I don't want to say. Now, that I just don't—I don't talk about that. You know that. I'm not one that says we're attacking Mosul in 4 months.\nQ. Mr. President——\nThe President. Okay? We do it or we don't do it.\nYes. The President's Travel to New York City\nQ. You're interrupting your trip here to return to Washington on Monday. Can you tell us why you're doing that?\nThe President. Well, this isn't really for me, a trip. You know, I stay out of Manhattan because it's so disruptive to go to Manhattan. Now, I will be going on Sunday night. I have meetings on Monday and Tuesday, going to Manhattan. But I stay out because it's so disruptive.\nYou know, all of my life—I mean, my adult life, because I grew up in Queens, not in Manhattan. But during the time that I lived in Manhattan, whenever a President came in, it was very disruptive, and I think I'm probably more disruptive than any of them. So when they have to close Fifth Avenue, when they have to close 56th Street and many other streets. So I'm here for that reason. We're doing a tremendous amount of work. We're having, you know, large numbers of meetings, and I'm on the phone a lot. But I'm here for that reason. I just don't—I would love to go to my home in Trump Tower, but it's very, very disruptive to do it.\nThe President's Schedule\nQ. So you have the trip to Washington on Monday——\nThe President. Yes, we have a conference scheduled, we have a very important meeting scheduled, and we're going to have a pretty big press conference on Monday.\nNorth Korea\nQ. Secretary Tillerson has spoken, emphasizing diplomacy. You've spoken, increasingly emphasizing the potential for military options. Are you two on the same page?\nThe President. Totally. I can tell you, totally on the same page. And, Secretary, maybe you'd like to make a statement.\nSecretary Tillerson. Well, I think it takes a combined message there if we're going to get effective movement out of the regime in North Korea. I think the President has made it clear he prefers a diplomatic solution. I think he responded to that, in effect, just a moment ago. And so I think what the President is doing is trying to support our efforts by ensuring North Korea understands what the stakes are.\nQ. Speaking of the State Department right now, these recent acoustic attacks we've learned about regarding diplomats—American diplomats—in Cuba. Who is responsible for the acoustic attacks? Is it Cuba? Is it Russia? Who is to blame for that?\nSecretary Tillerson. We have not been able to determine who is to blame. We do hold the Cuban authorities responsible for the safety and security of all of our people, just as every host country has a responsibility for the safety and security of diplomats in their country. So we hold the Cuban authorities responsible for finding out who is it carrying out these health attacks on not just our diplomats, but as you've seen now, there are other cases with other diplomats as well.\nQ. What do you make of this awful situation of them they're losing their hearing, these American diplomats?\nSecretary Tillerson. It's awful. You just described it exactly correctly, which is why we're bringing people out. Venezuela\nQ. Can you tell us what you're considering for Venezuela? What options are on the table right now to deal with this mess?\nThe President. We have many options for Venezuela. And by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option. We have many options for Venezuela. This is our neighbor. This is—you know, we're all over the world, and we have troops all over the world in places that are very, very far away. Venezuela is not very far away, and the people are suffering, and they're dying. We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary.\nQ. That would be U.S.-led, Mr. President?\nThe President. Say.\nQ. That would be a U.S.-led military operation?\nThe President. We don't talk about it. But a military operation, a military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\nKorean Worker's Party Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea\nQ. We heard the North Korean state TV saying, \"We consider the U.S. no more than a lump which we can beat to a jelly anytime.\"\nThe President. Well, let me hear others say it. Because when you say that, I don't know what you're referring to and who is making the statement.\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. But let me hear Kim Jong Un say it, okay? He's not saying it. He hasn't been saying much for the last 3 days. You let me hear him say it.\nNorth Korea\nQ. Mr. President, do you support regime change in North Korea or in Venezuela? Do you think those regimes——\nThe President. I don't want to comment because I think they're very different places, so I don't want to comment. But I support peace, I support safety, and I support having to get very tough if we have to, to protect the American people and also to protect our allies.\nVice President Michael R. Pence\nQ. Do you think your Vice President will be a candidate for President in 2020?\nThe President. I don't think so. No. Not—no, I don't think so at all. He's a good guy. He's just—as you know, he's left for Colombia and various other places. He's been terrific. He's been a great ally of mine and a great friend of mine.\nNorth Korea\nQ. Are you considering further economic sanctions against North Korea?\nThe President. Yes, we are. Yes, we are. Very strong ones.\nQ. And which ones?\nThe President. They're already very strong. We are considering additional sanctions at a very, very high level. And probably, you could say, as strong as they get. Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-08-11", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations Nikki R.

S. 114, approved August 12, was assigned Public Law No. 115-46.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128032", "text": "The President. Well, thank you very much. As you know, this was a small press conference, but a very important one, and it was scheduled to talk about the great things that we're doing with the Secretary on the Veterans Administration. And we will talk about that, very much so, in a little while, but I thought I should put out a comment as to what's going on in Charlottesville.\nSo, again, I want to thank everybody for being here. In particular, I want to thank our incredible veterans. And thank you, fellas. Let me shake your hand.\n[At this point, the President shook hands with veterans in attendance.]\nGreat people. They're great people.\nSituation in Charlottesville, VA\nBut we're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence, on many sides. On many sides. It's been going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. This has been going on for a long, long time.\nIt has no place in America. What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives. No citizen should ever fear for their safety and security in our society, and no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play or be with their parents and have a good time.\nI just got off the phone with the Governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, and we agreed that the hate and the division must stop and must stop right now. We have to come together as Americans with love for our Nation and true affection—really, and I say this so strongly—true affection for each other.\nOur country is doing very well in so many ways. We have record—just absolute record—employment. We have unemployment, the lowest it's been in almost 17 years. We have companies pouring into our country. Foxconn and car companies and so many others, they're coming back to our country. We're renegotiating trade deals to make them great for our country and great for the American worker. We have so many incredible things happening in our country. So when I watch Charlottesville, to me it's very, very sad.\nI want to salute the great work of the State and local police in Virginia—incredible people; law enforcement, incredible people—and also the National Guard. They've really been working smart and working hard. They've been doing a terrific job. Federal authorities are also providing tremendous support to the Governor. He thanked me for that. And we are here to provide whatever other assistance is needed. We are ready, willing, and able.\nAbove all else, we must remember this truth: No matter our color, creed, religion, or political party, we are all Americans first. We love our country. We love our God. We love our flag. We're proud of our country. We're proud of who we are. So we want to get the situation straightened out in Charlottesville, and we want to study it. And we want to see what we're doing wrong as a country, where things like this can happen.\nMy administration is restoring the sacred bonds of loyalty between this Nation and its citizens, but our citizens must also restore the bonds of trust and loyalty between one another. We must love each other, respect each other, and cherish our history and our future together. So important. We have to respect each other. Ideally, we have to love each other.\nVeterans Health Care\nAnd now to the Veterans Administration, where I'm so proud of David Shulkin and the job you've done, what you've done in such a short period of time. I think you folks would attest to it. If anybody disagrees, you can leave the room right now. [Laughter]\nBut David really has. He's a star, what he's been able to do. So, David, I'd like to thank you very much for your leadership and for the profound improvements to the VA services that you've made in such a short period of time.\nToday is another milestone in our work to transform the VA, where we're doing record-setting business, including something called the Accountability Act, where David and his executives can now hold people accountable for doing a poor job and say, \"You're fired.\" You do a poor job for our veterans, you're fired. That's been in the making for 40 years; they weren't able to get it approved. One of our legislative successes. Frankly, one of our many legislative successes. We got it approved. And I know, David, it's making life a lot better, and people are working a lot harder because of it.\nIn a few moments, I will sign the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017. This bill will ensure that veterans continue to have the ability to see the doctor of their choice—so important—and don't have to wait or travel long distances for care. And during the campaign, I kept talking about it. People—these great, incredible veterans, our finest—they're waiting in line for 7 days, 9 days, 14 days, for ailments that could be fixed quickly, and they end up dying of things that could be taken care of very, very routinely. And I said, that's never going to happen when I'm President.\nAnd I said, even at the time, before having tremendous research given to me, and after the research was given, it was still back to the same, basic common sense. Why can't they go out and see a doctor? If they have to wait 7 days or 14 days on line, why can't they see a doctor, and we'll pay for the cost of the doctor? And that's going to be a lot less expensive, but, more importantly, you're going to have immediate medical care for our veterans, and that's what we're doing. And they're very, very thankful. And it started already, quite a little while ago, considering we're a very young administration. And I think you see from the veterans, they're very, very proud of it and very happy.\nVery importantly, this bill also authorizes new community-based outpatient clinics and improves the VA's ability to hire quality job candidates. We're getting candidates that are of the highest quality into the VA system now so that our veterans have more choices and more access to the absolute best possible care.\nI want to thank Congressman Phil Roe, Senator Johnny Isakson—they two people have been working so hard—Senator Dean Heller for their dedicated efforts to get this bill through Congress. It was very, very tough for reasons that I guess I understand, but it was not easy. And I will tell you that Phil and Johnny and Dean worked very, very hard to get it through. And by the way, I can also say others, and even some Democrats. Do you want to say their names? Secretary of Veterans Affairs David J. Shulkin. Sure.\nThe President. Go ahead. Say their names.\nSecretary Shulkin. Senator Tester and Representative Walz were key in helping us get this done, Mr. President.\nThe President. Good. See? I can do it. [Laughter]\nBut people fought, and they really fought us hard. And now the administration is fighting for you. We're working night and day to ensure our brave veterans are provided with world-class treatment—which is what they're getting—world-class treatment. And by the way, again, we're here for just a little more than 6 months; you're seeing it on a daily basis get better and better and better. And you're hearing it from the veterans. But they're getting this great medical treatment, care, procedures, and we're getting our facilities shaped up and made into world-class facilities at the same time.\nSo our great veterans deserve only the best, and that's exactly what they're getting.\nI want to thank everybody for being here, especially the wonderful veterans behind me. They have helped us so much. They're spectacular people.\nSituation in Charlottesville, VA\nAnd again, going back to Charlottesville, we have to heal the wounds of our country. These are wounds that have been going on for, really, a long time. And I thought, and everybody thought, and everybody wants it to heal, and it will heal. And we're going to make every effort possible to make sure that that healing procedure goes as quickly as possible.\nI love the people of our country. I love all of the people of our country. We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make it great for all of the people of the United States of America.\nThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n[The President shook hands with veterans and then began to exit the room.]\nThank you, everybody.\nQ.

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128004", "text": "PRESIDENT SANTOS: (As interpreted.) Good afternoon. Mr. Vice President, Mike Pence, welcome. Welcome to Colombia. We are truly honored to have you here.\nI had the honor of being the first head of state of the Western Hemisphere to take a phone call from you after your inauguration, and I am very grateful for it because I interpreted it as you recognizing the very special relationship that our two countries have had.\nLast May, you had me over in your home, the Naval Observatory in Washington, and now you have had another kind gesture, because Colombia is the first country you visit in Latin America.\nAnd this reaffirms our strategic alliance and our friendship with your government and the people of the United States. Colombians are very proud of this alliance that has been strengthened over time and over several administrations.\nVice President Pence is arriving at a historical moment, at a turning point when the last containers in which we have placed all of the FARC weapons and are now in the hands of the United Nations and our leaving the rural areas where the former guerilla have gotten together, and the idea now is to decommission and destroy all those arms. And that is no more and no less than the end of the decommissioning of our weapons. And we have already begun a process of reintegration of the former members of this insurgent group into civilian life.\nDuring this peace process that your country has proven so helpful is a triumph -- a triumph for democracy -- and clear evidence that conflict, regardless of how profound they may be, they can be resolved through reason and dialogue.\nHere, we did not negotiate our economic model, nor did we negotiate private property, nor the development model or public policy, and much less our military services. What we did was to strengthen the rule of law, as well as our democratic institutions, and to give our countryside, our rural area, and our agrarian agricultural policy the importance that they should have had for a very long time. And you, Vice President Pence, understand this very well because you come from an agricultural state.\nAnd we have now embarked in a new era of cooperation with the United States on several fronts. Plan Colombia, that has now become Paz Colombia with bipartisan support, will focus on very special programs that will allow us to make headway in peace-building and also in rebuilding all the areas most affected by the conflict.\nAllow me to reiterate, on behalf of the people of Colombia and on my own behalf, our gratitude to the government of the Trump administration for supporting the consolidation of peace in Colombia.\nThe end of the conflict with FARC will allow us to be far more effective in this common battle that our two countries are waging against drug trafficking. We are cognizant that illegal crops have increased in recent years, and that is a shared concern because we have a shared responsibility.\nDuring our talks, I had the chance to explain to Vice President Pence the specific plan that we've put in motion in order to do away with -- or to disappear 100,000 hectares of coca shrub in Colombia. The first half that corresponds to forced eradication, we have already cleared 27,000 hectares. The other 50 percent is being eradicated through voluntary substitution programs, and we have already eradicated over 10,000 hectares, but we do have the commitment with over 86,000 families to surpass the 50,000 hectares that we intend on destroying.\nThe Minister of Defense is responsible for this program, together with the High Advisor for the post-conflict, coordinated by the Vice President of Colombia, General Naranjo. And we measure it every week with the support of the U.S. embassy, with the purpose of guaranteeing its fulfillment.\nAnd this is a monumental task, and we are going to fulfill it. We are very happy to share this good news with you, Mr. Vice President Pence, and also explain that the agenda between our countries has evolved and has gone way beyond the war on drug trafficking. The U.S. has provided us with very valuable support in our desire to join the OECD, and we already have the approval of several committees, and that support has been reiterated by President Trump himself, and it is going to prove key so that we receive a green light in the other two committees we need to be approved in order for Colombia to join the OECD.\nAnd the trade relation between our countries is becoming increasingly stronger. The free trade agreement has brought great benefits that we can further empower. Less than a year ago, it was here, in the city of Cartagena, that we installed the U.S.-Colombia Entrepreneurial Advisory Council. And this council has become a very important voice for both our countries' private sectors, and has allowed us to understand and support business opportunities.\nAnd thanks to the end of the conflict with FARC, new opportunities are opening up for agriculture and mining, particularly in areas hit very hard by violence. And as far as access to the U.S. market is concerned, Vice President Pence has brought good news, but I will let him give us that good news.\nTourism is another front of our relationship that is on the rise and that we hope to further strengthen. Last year, we had an average of U.S. tourists increase by 16 percent. In the past, that average annual number was barely 5 percent. And we want an increasing number of U.S. visitors to come to Colombia and enamor themselves with all the beautiful treasures that we have to share with you and the world at large. And to this, there are many social, economic, and academic opportunities for the citizens of both our countries.\nNaturally, we spoke about Venezuela, and with Vice President Pence and President Trump, we have expressed our concern, and the concern of the entire region and world, over what is happening in Venezuela.\nIn the sister nation of Venezuela, they are destroying the freedom and institutional framework and institutional order. Your country, Vice President, and my country have always defended the legacy of our founding farmers -- freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, and, naturally, peace. And those are values that we must always uphold and defend -- always. And that's why we must do everything possible so that Venezuela reestablishes its democracy.\nBut since friends have to tell each other the truth, I have told Vice President Pence that the possibility of a military intervention shouldn't even be considered, neither in Colombia nor in Latin America. From the south of the Rio Grande to the Patagonia, could we agree on this? America is a continent of peace. It is the land of peace. Let us preserve it as such.\nThe pressure on the Venezuelan regime must be maintained and increased, as was stated by the countries that met in Lima last week. They said: We condemn and reject what is happening in Venezuela.\nAn illegal constituent assembly is killing democratic institutions. It is the coup de grвce we support all the measures adopted by the U.S. government, and we will support additional measures, provided we always look for a negotiated solution and, above all, a peaceful solution.\nMr. Vice President, we are here at the House of Illustrious Guests -- that is how it's called -- and it is located inside the cadet naval school facilities where I, 50 years ago, acquired the values of military education, and they have been with me all of my life. The anthem of our navy ends with a beautiful sentence that says: And that is why I sing when I sail. I do not care about the storm, because I am always guided by two stars -- that of my country and my home.\nAnd I could add that the Americans -- both Americans from the north and Americans from the south -- must always be enlightened two other stars -- that of democracy and that of freedom. And always, always we must be vigilant to ensure that they never lose their shine and light.\nThank you once again, Vice President Pence, for your gesture of choosing us as the first country on your tour throughout Latin America.\nThank you. Thank you for your government support to our country and to peace in Colombia. Let us continue working together, united, to further strengthen our relationship as strategic partners, allies, and, above all, as friends.\nThank you. Thank you very much.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: President Santos, thank you for the warm welcome you and Maria Clemencia have shown to me and my wife, Karen.\nIt was an honor, along with President Donald Trump, to welcome you to the White House during your historic visit in May. And now it is a personal honor for me to be to be the first member of our new administration to visit Colombia.\nAnd on behalf of President Trump, I'm here to deliver a very simple message to you and to the people of this great nation: The United States stands with Colombia. Colombia has no better partner and friend than the United States of America.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States will always put the security and prosperity of America first. But as I hope my presence here today demonstrates, America first does not mean America alone.\nThe United States stands with Colombia because our security and our prosperity are inextricably linked. Our interests are aligned. Our values that you spoke of so eloquently are the same. And the birthright of freedom belongs to both our people.\nColombia won its independence less than a half-century after the United States. And, last week, Colombia celebrated the 198th anniversary of the Battle of Boyacб, when your forbearers cast off the shackles of foreign oppression.\nThe United States was proud to be the first democracy to recognize your independence. Colombia signed its first treaty of commerce with the United States, back in 1824. And over the generations, our citizens have stood shoulder-to-shoulder to protect our most precious values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.\nThe United States has stood with Colombia through times of great challenge, and we continue to stand with you today, in this time of hope and opportunity for the Colombian people.\nMr. President, under your leadership, Colombia has signed an agreement that ended the longest-running conflict in the history of the Western Hemisphere. But now, Colombia faces the greater challenge of consolidating that peace. The greatest risk, as we discussed, to that peace is practical and real: the absence of infrastructure, basic services, the rule of law in war-affected areas that's creating a haven for criminal activities, drugs and violence.\nMr. President, know that the United States will continue -- continue to partner with Colombia to address these issues, because we've long recognized the importance of Colombian security and prosperity to our own.\nThis year, on trade, marks the 6th year of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. It's an agreement that has created jobs and opportunities in both our nations. Colombia is the United States' third-largest trading partner in Latin America, with a two-way goods trade of nearly $27 billion in 2016 alone.\nToday, I am pleased to announce that the United States has reached an agreement to allow Colombian Haas avocados into the U.S. market. I want to congratulate you, President Santos, and your government. I also want to thank you for expanding access for U.S. rough rice in Colombia.\nWe welcome this progress, and we're confident that our nations' leaders can continue with further progress in the days ahead.\nTo that end, as I told you today, the United States supports Colombia's aspirations to join the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. As a concrete demonstration of this support, I'm pleased to announce today that the United States will provide Colombia up to $2 million in technical assistance to achieve that objective.\nIn spite of all this progress, our greatest concern, as President Trump discussed with you at the White House -- and we discussed again today -- is the dramatic increase in cocaine production, which has now reached an all-time high in Colombia. This worsening crisis requires swift action to protect the people of both our countries.\nThe drug trade is a wellspring of violence, crime, and corruption, victimizing the Colombian people. And in the United States, illegal drugs coming from Colombia have poisoned our children, torn apart our families, and devastated too many communities. Mr. President, this must end -- and this must end soon.\nI can assure you, under President Donald Trump, the United States will continue to take decisive action to address our nation's demand for illegal drugs, with border security, internal enforcement, and a renewed effort to remove dangerous criminals, gang members, and drug dealers from the streets of our country.\nLast week, I stood with President Trump as he declared a national health emergency to combat the scourge of opioid abuse and addiction all across our nation.\nAnd to protect the people of the United States, we will also continue to work directly with Colombia to combat drug production and transnational criminal syndicates. And, Mr. President, we will support efforts to strengthen the Colombian judicial system to deal with traffickers more effectively.\nUnder your leadership, Mr. President, Colombia represents the future of Latin America. It is a future of freedom, security, and prosperity. And America stands with you.\nAs we look toward that future, Colombia stands not only with the United States, but with free nations and peoples all across our hemisphere. The last three decades have seen the flowering of freedom and democracy from the tip of South America to the top of Central America.\nAnd while Colombia and other countries across the region have achieved such rapid progress toward freedom, as the world watches we see your neighbor to the east has gone in the exact opposite direction.\nIn Venezuela, we're seeing the tragedy of tyranny play out before our eyes. As President Trump has said, in his words, \"The [Venezuelan] people are suffering and they are dying.\" They're experiencing grinding poverty. Families cannot find the food and medicine they need to survive. Innocent children are perishing every day from hunger.\nToday, the once-free people of Venezuela are being forced to endure this fate by the brutality of the Maduro regime. No free people has ever chosen to walk the path from prosperity to poverty. No free people has ever chosen to turn what was once, and should still be, one of South America's richest nations into its poorest and most corrupt.\nThe Maduro regime has ignored and undermined its National Assembly. It's stifled the voices of a free press and the masses alike, and imprisoned countless political opponents. And more than 130 brave Venezuelans have already died in the desperate fight for democracy.\nThe United States, Colombia, and free nations of Latin America will not be silent. Venezuela is sliding into dictatorship, and as President Donald Trump has said, \"The United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\" We will continue to stand with free nations across our hemisphere until democracy is restored for the Venezuelan people.\nLet me take this moment to thank you, President Santos, for Colombia's regional leadership in this cause. Colombia has publicly denounced the Maduro regime and increased financial surveillance of its ill-gotten assets.\nLast week, 12 nations, including Colombia, jointly issued the Lima Declaration -- a strong statement of the region's opposition to the Maduro regime's abuse of power and abuse of the Venezuelan people.\nAt President Trump's direction, the United States of America has issued three rounds of targeted sanctions, including new sanctions just last week, against Maduro and his inner circle. And you can be assured, Mr. President, we will continue to take action until the Maduro regime restores democracy, holds free and fair elections, releases all political prisoners, and ends the repression of the Venezuelan people.\nAs President Trump said just a few days ago, \"We have many options for Venezuela.\" But the President also remains confident that, working with all of our allies across Latin America, we can achieve a peaceable solution to the crisis facing the Venezuelan people.\nWorking with free nations across this hemisphere, the United States will continue to bring the full measure of American economic and diplomatic power until democracy is restored in Venezuela.\nWe do this because it's right. The Venezuelan people deserve freedom. We do this because, as President Trump has said, in his words, a \"stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of the entire hemisphere.\" Failed states know no borders. A failed state in Venezuela will drive more illegal drug trafficking, with its murderous criminal consequences, radiating outward. A failed state in Venezuela will drive more illegal migration, compromising our borders, damaging our economies. And ultimately, a failed state in Venezuela will endanger the wellbeing of all who call this hemisphere home.\nAnd know this, Mr. President: What we do for Venezuela, we will do together. We all live in the same neighborhood. We succeed when our neighbors succeed. We suffer when our neighbors suffer. And so we will continue to act, together, to support the people of Venezuela in their struggle for freedom.\nAnd we call on our neighbors and your neighbors in Latin America to do more. And I promise you, the United States will not rest, we will not relent until Venezuela is restored to a full and prosperous democracy.\nThe Venezuelan people will be free once more, for here in the New World, freedom always wins. And as Simуn Bolнvar said, \"A people that loves freedom will in the end be free.\"\nThe United States is grateful for our partnership and our friendship with Colombia. And, Mr. President, you can be assured that we will continue to work hand-in-hand with Colombia, in security, in prosperity, and in defense of the timeless values that gave birth to our nations and that have brought us closer together ever since.\nWe share a past and we share a future -- and we will meet that future together.\nThank you, President Santos, again for your hospitality. It's my great honor to be here.\nMODERATOR: President Santos and Vice President Pence will take a couple of questions from the media from both countries. And we will start with the Colombia press, Maricia de la Torre (ph) from Caracol News.\nQ: (In progress) -- here in Colombia. When President Trump, when your government said this day that he is not ruling out a military intervention in Venezuela, exactly what does it mean? And I also would like to know if this part of this trip that you're having in Latin America includes looking for support from the countries, like Colombia, Chile. You're going to Chile, you're going to Argentina, you're going to Panama later. So are you looking for support in Latin America for that military intervention?\nAnd also, if President Santos would like to say something about that. Welcome. Thank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you very much. And let me say, as the world learned in this administration, President Trump is a leader who says what he means, and means what he says. But the President sent me here to continue to marshal the unprecedented support of countries across Latin America; to achieve, by peaceable means, the restoration of democracy in Venezuela. And we believe it is achievable by those means.\nAs I said earlier, the United States will continue to bring the full weight of American economic and diplomatic power to bear. We simply will not accept the emergence of a dictatorship in our hemisphere. The Venezuelan people deserve better. Our hemisphere deserves better. And you hear in President Trump's words the resolve of the United States of America to see this through and to restore democracy and constitutional government in Venezuela. And as I travel throughout the region, it will be my aim to continue to build on the momentum that exists today among countries all across this region to achieve that objective for the Venezuelan people.\nPRESIDENT SANTOS: (As interpreted.) I have little to add to what I said earlier. A military intervention would be unacceptable to all countries in Latin America. And what we all want is to reestablish democracy in Venezuela, and we will continue collectively pressing in this regard.\nQ: Hi, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, thank you very much. To start with -- Vice President Pence, President Trump on Friday, when he suggested that a military option may be under consideration for Venezuela, many analysts interpreted that to play into Maduro's hand because it invoked dark memories of a whole generation of U.S. interventionism abroad. Can you speak to that at all? How does that affect that situation here diplomatically? Do you think it makes it more difficult to unite the forces within the region and within the hemisphere against Maduro? And, separately, is the United States considering any oil sanctions as additional pressure for the Venezuelan government?\nAnd, Mr. President Santos, a question for you. You said that you thought it was unwise for President Trump to make that threat, and I'm wondering why you think that is. If you can elaborate that on a little bit more. And does it make more difficult for you to unite your allies and your neighbors here in the continent against Venezuela when there's a U.S. military threat that looms over all of this? Thank you.\nPRESIDENT SANTOS: (As interpreted.) I will repeat what I said during my initial remarks. The Latin American continent, every country in Latin America would not favor any form of military intervention, and that's why we're saying that we are intent on looking into other measures, some of which are already underway, and others to be implemented in the future.\nBut a transition in the Venezuelan regime towards democracy must be a peaceful transition. It must be, hopefully, a democratic transition. And it must be quickly, this transition -- because as we have said here, what interests us the most is the people of Venezuela, because the people of Venezuela are suffering. They are hungry. They lack medications. And that's why this transition has to take place as promptly and quickly and possible. But it must be done peacefully.\nYou mentioned in your question the ghost of military interventions. Fortunately, in Latin America, [this] disappeared a long time ago, and we don't want that phantom to reappear.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you for the question, Phil. The President said the United States has many options. But the President sent me here to build on what we believe is an unprecedented and growing alliance among Latin American nations, with the United States of America, to isolate Venezuela economically and diplomatically. And we believe that we can achieve, by peaceable means, a transition in Venezuela back to the democracy that the people of that country so richly deserve.\nWhat the world heard last week in the voice of President Donald Trump was resolve and determination -- a determination not to let this moment slip, not to stand idly by while a neighbor collapses into dictatorship -- which, as President Santos said very eloquently, is precisely what is happening in their neighbor to the east.\nUnder the guise of democratic institutions and a so-called constituent assembly, we're seeing the apparatus put in place to result in Venezuela crumbling into a dictatorship. And that is simply unacceptable not just to the President of the United States and our country, but, happily, it is broadly acceptable to leaders all across this region. And I can assure you that what the United States and our friends and allies in the region have done before, we will do more.\nPresident Santos and I discussed in some detail additional measures that could be taken to further pressure the regime in Venezuela economically. We will continue on this trip, and beyond, to bring diplomatic pressure to bear.\nBut as the President has said, the people of Venezuela are suffering. They're suffering under deprivation. They're suffering under the brutal tactics of the Maduro regime. And President Trump is absolutely determined to marshal all of the support of nations across this region to see democracy restored in Venezuela.\nQ: The possibility of oil sanctions, is that something that came up in your discussions?\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, let me say that we're looking at a full range of additional economic sanctions and also calling on nations around the world to become more engaged and more involved in restoring democracy in Venezuela.\nBut again, the President sent me here to say that we are going to bring the full weight of American economic and diplomatic power to bear on creating the conditions where the Venezuelan people can once again enjoy the democracy that is their heritage, before the last two regimes, and will be their future.\nMODERATOR: Maria Camila Roa from Blu Radio.\nQ: Now that FARC are no longer an armed group, will the U.S. government be willing to remove them from the terrorist list? And will there be support from the United States in this stage without FARC to combat or to face common crime here in Colombia?\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: President Santos and I talked extensively about his government's efforts to follow through on the historic peace agreement. And the United States, in a variety of ways -- USAID and others -- has made efforts to come alongside and support those efforts, and we will continue to do so.\nWe remain hopeful that peace will prosper in the wake of this agreement, but we do believe that addressing core issues of judicial reform, infrastructure, basic services, will all be part and parcel of moving the nation forward in the years ahead.\nBut Colombia is a valued partner of the United States, a cherished friend, and we will continue to stand with Colombia for security and for the advancement of peace in this nation in the years ahead.\nPRESIDENT SANTOS: (As interpreted.) As I said earlier, we are truly grateful for all the support that the United States has provided us to bring about the process. Because without its support, the process would not have been possible. The U.S. has supported us during the process in order to coordinate it, and now it will support us in peace-building. And this is something for which we are truly grateful. It's been significant help, and will continue to be very important, this help -- because we stand before the monumental challenges I've said in the past. Putting an end to the conflict is one thing, but building peace -- that is another thing and a very difficult thing. And in peace-building we need all the help we can get, and the help received from the U.S. is something we appreciate from the bottom of our heart.\nQ: President and Vice President, thank you so much for having us here and for holding this press conference.\nPresident Santos, I wanted to begin with you. I know that you both spoke a great deal about the drug crisis. Are you considering at this point, or would you endorse the idea of returning to aerial fumigation?\nPRESIDENT SANTOS: (As interpreted.) We did discuss that point precisely, and I've explained to Vice President Pence that aerial spraying did not bring about the results everyone hoped for. In the year 2007 -- and I showed him the numbers -- is when we did the highest volume of air spraying of illegal crops, and that is one of the years when coca production increased the most.\nAnd we are convinced that the plan we have in place today, for the very first time, will provide us with a long-term structural solution -- because we've been combatting drug trafficking and illegal crops for 30 years. And in spite of all the efforts made, Colombia is the country that has made the biggest sacrifices in this global war on drugs. Even though those efforts did bring about some results, they were all marginal results, because today, regretfully, we are still a major exporter of cocaine to the global market.\nHowever, now, thanks to the peace process, we'll be able to go out to all these places where coca shrub is being grown, and we have in place a plan so that the coca growers will voluntarily substitute their illegal crops for legal crops. And we've already signed agreements with 86,000 families so that at least 50,000 hectares, from here to early next year, will be voluntarily substituted,\nAnd, on the other hand, we are doing what we call forced eradication, plant by plant, through our military services -- an additional 50,000 hectares of which we've already cleared 27,000.\nSo the ongoing plan is a plan we measure on a weekly basis with the participation of the United States. And I am confident that this plan, for the very first time -- because we are in times of peace and we don't have FARC opposing this process -- we will be successful.\nQ: To Phil Rucker's question, would you expect any additional sanctions announced this week? And then, I wanted to give you a chance to address what has been having in Charlottesville over this weekend. A number of critics, Republicans included, have criticized the President, saying that he was not forceful enough in specifically condemning white supremacists and other racist rhetoric that happened during that weekend. What do you make of that criticism, and what do you have to say about the crisis?\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, on the first topic, let me say that we did talk extensively about aerial spraying and the need for enforcement of the peace agreement and arrangements that are made transitioning citizens of Colombia away from illicit crops. And the United States will look to Colombia to follow through strongly on that, and we'll be supportive of those efforts.\nWith regard to additional sanctions, what I can assure you is that we will remain vigorous in our efforts to isolate Venezuela economically and diplomatically. And I would anticipate additional U.S. action in this regard sooner rather than later. We'll be talking to our allies across the region on this trip.\nBut again, as President Trump has made clear, we simply will not be silent. We will not stand by while Venezuela collapses into dictatorship.\nWith regard to yesterday, what happened in Charlottesville was a tragedy. Charlottesville, Virginia is a beautiful community, a university town with a rich heritage. President Santos's son just graduated from the University of Virginia, and the President himself spoke on that campus.\nAnd what occurred there, as local and state officials have said, is in no way a reflection of the good and decent people of Charlottesville or of America.\nOf what happened there -- yesterday, President Trump clearly and unambiguously condemned the bigotry, violence, and hatred which took place on the streets of Charlottesville.\nOur hearts go out to the victims of violence that ensued; the family of the young woman who lost her life; of the families of the two police officers who fell in the line of duty, and all of those that are injured.\nWe have no tolerance for hate and violence, from white supremacists, neo-Nazis, or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.\nThe President also made clear that behavior by others of different militant perspectives are also unacceptable in our political debate and discourse. Our administration is bringing the full resources of the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the violence that ensued yesterday in Charlottesville. And we will hold them to account, under the law.\nThe President's call for unity yesterday, though, was from the heart. It was a sincere call, in these too divided times in our country, for those on the extremes to be dismissed, and for the vast majority of Americans who cherish freedom, who cherish justice for all, to come together in new and in renewed ways.\nI will say I take issue with the fact that many in the national media spent more time criticizing the President's words than they did criticizing those who perpetrated the violence to begin with.\nWe should be putting the attention where it belongs, and that is on these extremist groups that need to be pushed out of the public debate entirely, and discredited for the hate groups and dangerous fringe groups that they are.\nThe truth, as President Santos knows, is, the overwhelming majority of Americans, I would say, with very few exceptions, cherish the values that are at the foundation of our nation. They're the shared values that we have with the people of Colombia.\nAnd in the aftermath of yesterday's violence, and on this Sunday here in Colombia, I think it's a good time to pray -- to pray for those who lost their lives yesterday; to pray for their families; to pray for the injured; but also to pray for greater unity in America that I believe will come. We can seize this moment, as President Trump said yesterday, as a moment where we stop, where we pause, and where we move forward together.", "timestamp": "2017-08-13", "title": "The Vice President's News Conference with President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia in Cartagena, Colombia"}

Herbert \"Hawk\" Carlisle USAF (ret.), President and CEO, National Defense Industrial Association: \"China's theft of our intellectual property has had a significant impact on our national security and our economic productivity, the very basis of our strength as a nation. Our military is simply the best the world has ever seen because of the men and women who volunteer to serve and because of the vitality and quality of our defense industry and entrepreneurs. Our innovators are the envy of the world, but they simply cannot compete against a Chinese Communist Party led-strategy to steal their ideas and their technological breakthroughs. Critically, our military and our defense industry will be weakened and undermined if it cannot benefit from private sector innovation. NDIA and all of our members welcome the efforts by the Trump Administration to redress this misconduct, and are hopeful that more action will be taken to arrest China's attempts to undermine our economic and national security interests worldwide.\"\nDr. Zack Cooper, Senior Fellow for Asian Security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies: \"China's intellectual property theft and other unfair trade practices undermine not only the U.S. economy, but also U.S. national security. Economic competition must take place within a rules-based system that rewards hard work and protects innovation. China's intellectual property theft unfairly erodes U.S. competitiveness and weakens U.S. industries, including the defense industrial base. Beijing has also used economic pressure to unfairly coerce U.S. businesses, allies, and partners. It is appropriate that the United States work with businesses, allies, and partners to protect our workers, industries, innovations, and independence.\"\nRichard Ellings, President of the National Bureau of Asian Research: \"Due to [its] economic success, its rapid military buildup, and [its] apparent ambitions, China is the major issue in global affairs. Key to its success so far has been its acquisition of technology and trade secrets by every legal and illegal means. In the past decade Chinese entities have stolen several trillions of dollars of intellectual property from American companies from across the country, costing millions of jobs. I welcome the Trump Administration's announcement to investigate this issue and taking every responsible step toward driving down IP theft and putting the conduct of U.S.-China relations on a realistic and more sustainable footing.\"\nThe Honorable Dr. Patrick M. Cronin, Former Assistant Administrator, U.S. Agency for International Development: \"China employs all means to appropriate others' technology and intellectual property. The Trump Administration is to be applauded for urgently investigating new ways of containing threats as diverse as economic cyberespionage, hostile takeovers of high-tech business, and unfair rules imposed on joint ventures. At risk is not just American leadership and competitiveness. At risk is the very ability of the United States of America to remain a sovereign state.\"\nADM Dennis Blair, USN (Ret.), former Director of National Intelligence: \"The President's action today is an important and overdue first step. The United States badly needs a full court press of strong cooperative actions both by the government and the private sector to defend one of America's most important resources and competitive advantages--its ideas, inventions, copyrights, proprietary business information and strategies. They are currently being stolen by both foreign companies and governments, using a combination of hacking, official policies and traditional espionage. Many foreign countries and companies are involved, but China is the worst offender. This problem has been discussed and bemoaned for years without action. Jon Huntsman and I have called for a series of actions under legislation already passed by Congress to take action against those who benefit from these illegal actions, and I am delighted to see the executive branch starting down this road. With persistence and firm action, we can ensure American individuals and companies benefit from their entrepreneurial achievements.\"\nPhebe Novakovic, Chairman and CEO, General Dynamics: \"This commitment from the Administration comes at a critical juncture. The threat to our intellectual property is real and increasing. We see these types of threats in our defense and commercial aerospace businesses. We support the President's action today to help protect the intellectual property of our nation's industrial base.\"\nThomas A. Kennedy, Chairman and CEO, Raytheon Company: \"State-sponsored intellectual property theft is a problem for the U.S. defense industry and our military capability. It poses both economic and national security concerns. We applaud President Trump for taking the necessary steps to protect our industry and our country.\"\nDavid Alexander, President, General Atomics - Aeronautical Systems: \"We are encouraged by the President's commitment to address Chinese intellectual property theft. The U.S. Defense industry has certainly been subject to these aggressive actions and intellectual property theft has been extremely detrimental to U.S. National Security. We look forward to supporting the President's actions in this space.\"\nDr. Michael Pillsbury, Director of the Center on Chinese Strategy, The Hudson Institute: \"China's attack on U.S. intellectual property is a national security challenge of the first order, as well as a persistent check on our economic growth. By taking bold and decisive action to protect our intellectual property, President Trump is showing the world that the United States will stand up decisively for our national interests and put America First.\"\nProfessor Stefan Halper, University of Cambridge: \"Since China joined the WTO in 2001, 2.4 million U.S. jobs have been lost and 60,000 U.S. manufacturing firms have been forced out of business. Entire regions of the country have been hollowed out. Intellectual property theft--70% by China--now costs the U.S. some $600 billion a year. A thorough review of this problem, and a rebalancing of the trade relationship, is urgent. The Administration is to be commended for initiating that today.\"\nFormer U.S. Representative J. Randy Forbes (R-VA), Founder of the Congressional China Caucus: \"China's assault on American intellectual property threatens our military edge and economic competitiveness. It is a serious threat to our national security and can only be countered by bold, aggressive action in support of our national interests. I commend President Trump for his leadership on this issue.\"\nRichard Lawless, former Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, 2002-2008: \"China was invited to joint WTO and, in so doing, embrace and abide by the rules and obligations of that organization. China has leveraged its WTO membership and market position to strip technology and the underlying IP from U.S., Japanese, and European firms active in all advanced technology sectors. An objective and factual examination of this systemic theft and coerced transfer of critical IP and its impact on the defense industrial base of these nations is long overdue.\"\nMarillyn A. Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin Corporation: \"Lockheed Martin welcomes the Trump Administration's focus on the critical need to protect U.S. defense and aerospace industry intellectual property. The continued theft and unlawful transfer of American defense know-how is of national security concern and threatens to undermine the competitiveness of U.S. industry.\"\nWes Bush, Chairman, President, and CEO of Northrop Grumman: \"Technological innovation is the heart of our national security and the bedrock of our economy. Theft of these innovations erodes our security and diminishes our economic competitiveness. This is an important action to address the serious problem of state-sponsored intellectual property theft.\"\nRoger A. Krone, Chairman and CEO, Leidos Inc.: \"We appreciate the President's focus on this grave issue, and support his escalated stance on dealing with those who would try to perpetuate these crimes. Safeguarding our intellectual property against nation-state sponsored cyber theft is key to protecting our national security, economy, and our ability to innovate though technological breakthroughs. The risk of theft has an ongoing impact on all aspects of life for our citizens, and costs billions of dollars each year that could be better spent on research and development.\"\nDaniel A. Blumenthal, Former Commissioner and Vice Chairman, United States-China Economic and Security Commission: \"The theft of our intellectual property by China has had a severe impact on our national security and our economic productivity, the very basis of our strength as a nation. We remain a superpower because of the vitality and industriousness of our workers and entrepreneurs. Critically, our military will be further weakened if it cannot benefit from private sector innovation. Beijing's strategy to steal our technology underscores its status as our foremost geopolitical and geo-economic competitor that seeks to weaken us. I welcome all efforts by the Trump Administration to redress this grave harm, and am hopeful that more action will be taken to arrest China's attempts to undermine our economic and national security interests globally.\"\nFormer Senator Jim Talent (R-MO), member of the United States-China Economic & Security Review Commission: \"China's theft of U.S. intellectual property -- including technology from our defense contractors. It is past time for strong measures from our government. Our economy depends on the protection of American innovators and the technology they create. The President's action is an important in safeguarding American intellectual property, and I support the President in standing strong on this critical economic and security issue.\"\nGeneral Keith Alexander, USA (Ret.), former Director of the National Security Agency: \"A little over five years ago, I said that the theft of American intellectual property was the greatest transfer of wealth in history. I believe that statement is even more true today. Protecting American innovators is essential to the United States' economic and national security. This Presidential action is an important step towards stopping the theft and forced transfers of American intellectual property, and I support the President in his actions today.\"", "timestamp": "2017-08-14", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying: Praise President Donald J.

Trump\nINVESTIGATING THEFT: Today, President Donald J. Trump is taking the first step to ensure we protect American innovation and the intellectual property (IP) of American companies.\n* President Trump is signing a Presidential Memorandum to direct the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to examine whether China should be investigated for unreasonable or discriminatory policies that may harm American IP rights, innovation, or technological development.\n* President Trump and his Administration have a strong commitment to protecting the IP of Americans and ending the illegal theft and transfer of IP to foreign nations.\n* USTR will analyze issues raised by the Presidential Memorandum and consult with Government agencies and advisory committees to determine what action, if any, is appropriate.\n* While there have been serious and consistent allegations of a problem with China and IP theft, President Trump is not prejudging the inquiry and USTR will decide whether to launch a formal investigation and, if so, whether action should be taken and what that action would be.\nCHINA PROFITS FROM AMERICAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: Reports suggest that China has greatly benefited from the theft of American IP, in some cases forcing American companies to transfer their innovation to benefit China.\n* According to the 2017 update to the 2013 report of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property (IP Commission Report) released by the National Bureau of Asian Research, Chinese government policies lead to the theft of American IP.\n* China uses restrictions such as joint venture requirements, equity ownership limitations, opaque administrative processes, and other practices aimed at the transfer of United States technology to Chinese companies.\n* China has gained unauthorized access to the computer networks of United States businesses for commercial purpose and, on a number of occasions, has stolen firms' commercial information.\n* According to the Department of Homeland Security, China, including Hong Kong, accounts for 88 percent of seized counterfeit goods coming into the United States.\n* According to the United States Chamber of Commerce, 86 percent of all counterfeit goods worldwide come from China and Hong Kong.\n* According to the United States Chamber of Commerce, the equivalent of 12.5 percent of China's exported goods are counterfeit.\nAMERICA AND ITS WORKERS SUFFER: IP theft directly harms the American economy and American workers.\n* American workers and companies are directly harmed by theft of IP, which has caused hundreds of billions of dollars in damage to the United States economy.\n* The IP Commission Report estimates that the annual cost to the United States economy from IP theft could be as high as $600 billion.\n* According to the IP Commission Report, China is estimated to be responsible for between 50 percent and 80 percent of all IP theft costs that harm the United States economy.\n* The United States economy and labor markets depend on American innovation and productivity; the scale and persistence of IP theft directly threatens the economy.\n* The 81 industries designated as IP-intensive accounted, directly and indirectly, for 45.5 million jobs in 2014, representing 29.8 percent of all jobs in the United States.\n* As General Keith Alexander, former Director of the National Security Agency, put it: the ongoing theft of IP is \"the greatest transfer of wealth in history.\"\nA PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: President Trump is following through on his promise to the American people to protect their IP so they can benefit from their innovation.\n* Then-candidate Trump said, on August 8, 2016:\n\"Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States.\"", "timestamp": "2017-08-14", "title": "Press Release - Fact Sheet: President Donald J.

I'm in Washington today to meet with my economic team about trade policy and major tax cuts and reform. We are renegotiating trade deals and making them good for the American worker. And it's about time.\nOur economy is now strong. The stock market continues to hit record highs, unemployment is at a 16-year low, and businesses are more optimistic than ever before. Companies are moving back to the United States and bringing many thousands of jobs with them. We have already created over 1 million jobs since I took office.\nWe will be discussing economic issues in greater detail later this afternoon, but based on the events that took place over the weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, I would like to provide the Nation with an update on the ongoing Federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everyone.\nI just met with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into the deadly car attack that killed one innocent American and wounded 20 others. To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered.\nAs I said on Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence. It has no place in America. And as I have said many times before, no matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.\nRacism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, White supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans. We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal. We are equal in the eyes of our Creator, we are equal under the law, and we are equal under our Constitution. Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.\nTwo days ago, a young American woman, Heather Heyer, was tragically killed. Her death fills us with grief, and we send her family our thoughts, our prayers, and our love. We also mourn the two Virginia State troopers who died in service to their community, their commonwealth, and their country. Troopers Jay Cullen and Berke Bates exemplify the very best of America, and our hearts go out to their families, their friends, and every member of American law enforcement.\nThese three fallen Americans embody the goodness and decency of our Nation. In times such as these, America has always shown its true character: responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.\nAs a candidate, I promised to restore law and order to our country, and our Federal law enforcement agencies are following through on that pledge. We will spare no resource in fighting so that every American child can grow up free from violence and fear. We will defend and protect the sacred rights of all Americans, and we will work together so that every citizen in this blessed land is free to follow their dreams in their hearts, and to express the love and joy in their souls.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

And thank you joining us on a special morning. I would like to welcome and thank the Vice President of the United States for this official visit.\nThis truly certifies the level of interest and enthusiasm with regard to our country, given that we've started to build trust, to become predictable, and, clearly, that is the beginning of a process of employment generation in our country as it brings investments, most definitely -- investments which are necessary for our country's development.\nIn addition, this reflects a relationship which began to heal 19 months ago, by starting to look for common areas. And this was obviously certified when I went to Washington and met with President Trump. This involves the affection there is between our countries.\nI would like to thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your presence here. Your visit with leading companies of the United States, some companies which are ratifying and confirming investments, and companies that are interested in taking part in the development of our country in the near future. Again, we need to generate employment, as that is a solution to poverty. We need to create a lot of jobs, and your companies that are determined to invest in our country are most welcome.\nDuring our working meeting, we also discussed trade matters, and we are obviously willing to exchange what both the Argentinians and the Americans produce. We also discussed the G20 and the WTO meeting at the end of the year. We think these are meetings that will provide an opportunity to boost the development of the whole continent.\nI also conveyed our deep gratitude, considering the clear and conclusive position of the United States in favor of Argentina's bid to join the OECD. We think this is a very important step as part of our transformation process. We do wish to become members of such a distinguished group of work.\nI also reiterated that we are very happy to be able to continue fighting against drug-trafficking, terrorism, money-laundering, and corruption. We have worked very collaboratively and intelligently in recent months, and we hope to continue to do so, as this is a path that guarantees the growth of our countries and development and peace of mind for our communities, essentially.\nAnd we also talked a bit about Venezuela. We share the concern over developments in our beloved Venezuela. We feel for the suffering of Venezuelans. And we reiterated, both of us, the need to continue to demand President Maduro an electoral schedule, respect for individual liberties, for the independence of the powers, and to stop actions that have only impoverished Venezuela and have greatly damaged its population.\nThis has been a truly important meeting for us. Your presence is important, Mr. Vice President. We believe in a mature, intelligent relationship between our countries, and we think, on that basis, we can build a better future for the Argentinians and the Americans.\nSo let us hope this will be the first of many visits. You will always be welcome. I know last night you had a very nice meal with your wife -- a very romantic evening at your hotel. (Laughter.) So I do hope you'll visit us once again with your wife and that you will get to see other parts of our country, which is a large country, like your own. It has beautiful spots that are worth visiting.\nThank you once again.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you, President Macri. Thank you for the warm hospitality that you've shown to me on my very first visit to Argentina. I extend the warm and personal greetings of your friend of many years, the President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.\nI spoke with the President this morning, and he wanted me to convey his gratitude to you, not only for your hospitality, but for the growing partnership and strong relationship that is now enjoyed under his leadership with the United States and your leadership here in Argentina.\nIt was my honor, along with the President, to welcome you to the White House just a few short months ago, and now it's my honor to be welcomed by you to Argentina and to your beautiful capital city of Buenos Aires, where my wife and I did enjoy a date last night. (Laughter.)\nI'm here today to reaffirm the enduring bond between the United States and Argentina. And I'm here to commend you, President Macri, for your bold reform agenda, an agenda that's transforming Argentina's economy at home and restoring its reputation around the world. Argentina, in many ways, is an inspiration across this hemisphere and across the wider world. And I'm here to tell you, on behalf of President Trump, the United States is with you.\nUnder President Trump, the United States will always put the security and prosperity of America first. But as I hope my presence here demonstrates, America first does not mean America alone.\nThe United States and Argentina are woven together by geography and history, and a tapestry of liberty. It was nearly 250 years ago that the founders of the United States of America proclaimed our independence. It was only 40 years later -- almost to the day -- that the forebears of Argentina followed their own path to freedom.\nWhere the United States has George Washington, Argentina has San Martнn, whose mausoleum I had the privilege to visit earlier today. Where the United States has our Declaration of Independence, Argentina has the Acta de Independencia. The United States is proud to stand with Argentina to this day in defense of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.\nPresident Macri, under your leadership, Argentina has reemerged as a strong advocate for these values and as a symbol of the productive and positive future that Latin America is building for itself. Today, Argentina has embarked on a great economic and political revival. And as our President said to you in his meeting at the White House, we applaud your political and economic reforms.\nOver the past 18 months, President Macri has taken important steps to break down barriers to growth, eased currency controls, reentered global capital markets, cut import and export tariffs, modernized labor rules, and invested in much-needed infrastructure.\nAs we share your view that membership in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development will help consolidate these reforms in Argentina, on behalf of the President, let me reiterate again that the United States of America strongly supports Argentina's bid to join the OECD.\nUnder your leadership, Mr. President, Argentina holds the promise of a stronger commercial partnership with the United States. Today, President Macri and I spoke about increasing our two-way trade for the benefit of both our countries. Our trade currently totals more than $24 billion, and our investment stands at more than $13 billion. This is a solid foundation for shared prosperity, as we look forward to building on it to our mutual benefit.\nFurthermore, as President Trump has said, we welcome Argentina's growing leadership role on the world stage. Last year -- or, excuse me, later this year, as we discussed, Argentina will host the World Trade Organization's Ministerial Conference, and next year, of course, you'll assume the G-20 presidency.\nArgentina's global leadership is good for our hemisphere. And, President Macri, let me thank you again for your actions, which are renewing Argentina's leadership and prosperity.\nBut as we know and as we discussed, security is the foundation of our prosperity, and today, our nations face many threats to our security, most especially the threat of global terrorism.\nArgentina, of course, is no stranger to this enemy. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Israeli Embassy bombing, which was followed two years later by the AMIA bombing -- the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of Argentina.\nThese two attacks claimed the lives of 114 innocent citizens. Earlier today, it was my great privilege to visit the memorial for these victims at the Metropolitan Cathedral, to breathe a word of prayer and respect for the loss.\nA quarter-century later, terrorism still threatens our nations, our people, and our very way of life. And President Macri, I can assure you: The United States will continue to stand with Argentina to confront this enemy and ensure our mutual security.\nAs a result of your visit to Washington, D.C., the United States will continue to strengthen our partnership to combat terrorist financing, as well as money laundering, and other illicit financial activities by transnational criminal organizations. And we are grateful for the full partnership in this cause.\nThe newly established Argentina-United States Dialogue on Illicit Financing, and our new bilateral Cyber Policy Working Group are protecting the security and economic interests of both our countries. And President Trump and I appreciate Argentina's partnership in this critical area, in this challenging time.\nArgentina is boldly leading Latin America toward a brighter future, but your progress, and the progress of the wider region, sadly stands in stark contrast to the collapse that we see in Venezuela.\nIn Venezuela, we are seeing the tragedy of tyranny play out before our eyes, in our own hemisphere. As President Trump has said, in his words, \"The [Venezuelan] people are suffering and they are dying.\" And they're experiencing grinding poverty; families cannot find the food and medicine they need to survive; innocent children are perishing from hunger every single day.\nToday, the once-free people of Venezuela are being forced to endure this fate by the brutality of the Maduro regime. The Maduro regime has ignored and undermined the National Assembly; stifled the voices of the free media and the people alike; and has imprisoned countless political opponents. And, most heartbreakingly, more than 130 brave Venezuelans have died in the desperate fight to restore democracy.\nVenezuela is sliding into dictatorship. And as President Donald Trump has said, and I quote, \"The United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\" President Trump has said that a stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of our entire hemisphere. And you can be assured, Mr. President: We will continue to stand with free nations across this hemisphere until democracy is restored for the Venezuelan people.\nAs I told you today, President Trump and I are especially grateful for Argentina's regional leadership in this cause. We applaud the measures you've taken to track down corrupt Venezuelan officials. We are grateful that Argentina voted with Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay to suspend Venezuela from Mercosur until democracy is restored.\nAnd we thank Argentina for joining 11 other countries to sign the Lima Declaration just last week -- sending a powerful message that the free peoples of the Americas will stand with the Venezuelan people and stand up to their oppressors.\nBut President Trump said, and we call on Latin America to do more. And know this: The United States will continue to bring the full measure of American economic and diplomatic power to bear until democracy is restored in Venezuela.\nAs the President mentioned a few days ago, the United States has, in his words, \"many options for Venezuela.\" But the President and I remain confident that, working with all our allies across Latin America, we will achieve a peaceable solution to the crisis facing the Venezuelan people.\nAnd know this, Mr. President: What we do for Venezuela, we will do together. We all live in the same neighborhood. We succeed when our neighbors succeed. We struggle when our neighbors struggle. And so we will continue to act, together, to support the people of Venezuela in their fight for freedom.\nMr. President, President Trump and I believe that Argentina will continue to be an exemplar of a better path in Latin America, under your leadership -- the path toward prosperity, security, and freedom. The United States is proud to partner with Argentina as you continue your march toward progress.\nAnd with the leadership of President Trump and the United States, and your leadership, President Macri, and with faith in the good people of both of our countries, we're confident that the best days for the United States and for Argentina are yet to come.\nPresident Macri, thank you again for your hospitality. It's a great, great honor to be with you today.\nMODERATOR: (As interpreted.) We will next begin the actual press conference offered by the President of Argentina, Mr. Macri, and the Vice President of the United States, Mr. Pence.\nMartin Dinatale from Infobae takes the floor.\nQ: (As interpreted.) Good morning. We would first like to ask President Mauricio Macri, what position did you convey for Argentina regarding President Trump's position a few days ago on his statement regarding a possible military intervention in Venezuela? Do you agree with that position? Have you discussed the possibility of other either economic or political sanctions that could be implemented? And this position stated by President Trump, couldn't it somehow conspire against the peaceful, pro-peace position of Latin America thus far?\nAnd we would also like to ask Vice President Pence specifically whether there has been any progress in terms of agreements on cybersecurity, which you referred to, and what sort of progress has there been. And what kind of advances could you mention in the fight against terrorism, considering, as you yourself stated, that Argentina has been targeted by terrorism? And, accordingly, whether there's any cooperation being provided by the United States with regard to the death of prosecutor Nisman. Thank you very much.\nPRESIDENT MACRI: (As interpreted.) The statement that the Vice President has just made clearly shows the level of agreement between us on how to tackle the issue of Venezuela. We must refine diplomatic and economic skills in order to ensure that a democracy is restored as swiftly as possible; that Venezuela, again, has an election schedule; that there are no normal political detainees; and that the powers are again independent in a framework of democracy.\nThat's the contents of our Mercosur communiquй, and we think that is a way to go. The way to go is not the use of force, but to deepen the political demand, taking into account the economic dimension, as well, to see how we can help ensure that democracy is restored in Venezuela.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you for the question. Specifically on the issue of counterterrorism, the President and I spoke at some length about enhanced cooperation and intelligence-sharing that's been taking place since President Macri's meeting with President Trump at the White House earlier this year. We pledged our mutual support to continue to work in a collaborative way, and we are grateful for President Macri and his government's full cooperation.\nTo see the tragedy that took place a quarter-century ago here in Argentina, to think of 9/11 in the United States, to see the unfolding asymmetrical threat that global terrorism presents, we greatly welcome and appreciate the expanded cooperation that President Macri and President Trump initiated in their meeting in Washington, D.C. And we'll continue to work in those ways to see to the security of the people of both of our countries.\nWith regard to Venezuela, we spoke about that issue as well. And as I just stated, President Trump sent me here to make it clear, in Argentina and across Latin America, that the United States will not stand by while Venezuela crumbles. And the President had made it clear, as well, that the United States has many options, and we reserve those options.\nBut we truly believe that by increasing economic and diplomatic pressure on the Maduro regime -- not just across the Americas, but across the wider world -- that we can achieve a restoration of democracy in Venezuela by peaceable means. And we'll continue to work very closely.\nI'm grateful to President Macri for his leadership over the last year and a half, speaking out boldly on the slide into dictatorship in Venezuela. We'll continue to work with countries all across the region to achieve that objective.\nBut President Trump is determined to bring the full weight of American economic and diplomatic power to bear until we see the suffering relieved in Venezuela, and democracy restored.\nMODERATOR: Our next question is from Shannon Pettypiece of Bloomberg News.\nQ: President Macri, given your desire for a diplomatic solution to the situation in Venezuela, if the United States was to move forward on a military option, given all options are on the table, how would you respond? And do you feel that that type of language is helpful?\nAnd then, for Vice President Pence, as you travel around the world trying to present this strong, unified message, back in Washington there continues to be this infighting in the West Wing, in particular these attacks on the National Security Advisor. Does that hurt your efforts abroad? And do you think there are additional changes needed in West Wing staff to eliminate or tamp down some of that very public infighting?\nPRESIDENT MACRI: (As interpreted.) Again, within Mercosur, we do not see force as an option to resolve the conflict in Venezuela. And we are very pleased to see unanimity across the continent. And with the leadership of the United States, in order for democracy to be restored in Venezuela, we need to carry on working in all fields of diplomacy to ensure that this is achieved -- because, every day, Venezuelans lose the lives while defending their rights to freedom. And we can't continue to tolerate that.\nVICE PRESIDENCE PENCE: Well, thank you for the question. Our administration, not some seven months old, has seen America restore more than a million jobs at home. But also, what the world has seen, under President Donald Trump, is an American President who is once again embracing our historic role as leader of the free world without apology.\nI think you can see the results of the President's strong leadership in the unanimous vote in the United Nations Security Council on additional sanctions in North Korea. I think you can see the result of the President's strong leadership in the 12-0 vote last week, embracing the Lima Declaration, further isolating Venezuela as its nation collapses into dictatorship.\nIn a very real sense, I believe that President Trump has restored the credibility of American power by being willing to take American values and American interests onto the world stage. And while we're putting America first, as I said earlier, I think the world is also getting the message that America first does not mean America alone.\nAnd my presence here, and in this swing across Latin America, as when the President himself has traveled around the world, is to bring together nations around the world, to work toward our common interests and to achieve results. And I believe the results speak for themselves.\nSo it's my great honor to represent the President this week in Latin America. And we're encouraged by the level of agreement among Latin American countries, and countries across the wider world, for what needs to be done with regard to isolating North Korea economically and diplomatically, to achieve the objective in North Korea of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. And I know that President Trump is encouraged by the level of support and the response to American leadership -- bringing a focus on the tragedy in Venezuela. We were just there yesterday.\nPresident Macri told me there are some 60,000 Venezuelan refugees here in Argentina. There are more than half-a-million, by some reports, in Colombia, where we were yesterday.\nI met with families who were fleeing the deprivation and persecution of the Maduro regime, and to hear from a grandmother who told me that she went and collected her five grandchildren because poverty had become so severe in their hometown. The children had to rise at four in the morning in Venezuela to get a ticket and then wait all day to use that ticket to buy one piece of bread. It's extraordinary to think. Venezuela has the potential to be one of the wealthiest nations in our hemisphere with its oil reserves alone. And yet the poverty and deprivation that is resulting from their collapse into dictatorship speaks for itself.\nAnd President Trump is going to continue to provide that strong unambiguous leadership on the world stage, and I think we're going to continue to see the progress that we've seen in Asia and as well as in our own hemisphere.\nMODERATOR: (As interpreted.) Next, Martin Ceval (ph) from El Cronista.\nQ: (As interpreted.) Good morning. Mr. Vice President Pence, me and my colleagues would like to ask the following: Since the beginning of the Trump administration, negotiations between Mercosur and the EU have sped up for a trade agreement. Does the United States feel any threat to its predominant position on that front? And do you intend to state any particular position during the upcoming WTO meeting? And we'd also like to know whether the White House intends to again get Argentina within the General System of Preferences and what the position of Argentina will be within the market.\nAnd for President Macri: Since the government has repeatedly spoken in favor of the multilateral trade system, does the bilateral position shown by the United States perhaps conspire against the goals of the December summit?\nThank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you for the question. President Macri and I spoke at some length about expanded trade opportunities between the United States and Argentina. And we think they are significant, particularly in the area of agriculture.\nI come from an agricultural state in the United States. I was governor of the state of Indiana before I became Vice President. And I know the quality of American pork, and I know that President Trump and President Macri have spoken, as well as officials -- even in the last week -- about expanding access of American pork to the market here in Argentina. And we've made great progress. We're going to continue to work toward making that progress. We also discussed the interest in exporting and importing beef on both sides. And, of course, lemon exports from Argentina were a topic.\nSo we had a very extensive conversation on commodity-specific areas, and those will continue. And our hope is that, with the energy that our administration and that President Macri's administration are placing behind this, we may have a breakthrough soon that will expand the economic relationship between Argentina and the United States, particularly on agricultural goods.\nThat being said, I'll speak later today at the stock exchange about the extraordinary economic relationship between the United States of America. We are greatly encouraged by the economic reforms that President Macri is advancing here. We believe that those reforms will further enhanced and strengthened in Argentina with membership in the OECD. And President Trump has weighed in strongly in favor of Argentina's membership in the OECD.\nBut I can assure you that a strong relationship -- economic relationship between the United States and Argentina, I think, can grow even stronger, still, to the benefit not only of your economy, but of ours. We believe that Argentina's turn towards free-market principles, reentering global capital markets, bringing about the kind of reforms that President Macri is advancing will support jobs and opportunities in the United States, and it will invite more foreign direct investment from our country here. And we look forward to building that relationship.\nPRESIDENT MACRI: (As interpreted.) I agree with the Vice President. We have so many opportunities to enhance relations between the United States and Argentina. We think that will bring prosperity, jobs, and development for our own country, and we hope that in December, at the WTO meeting, we'll find areas in which to deepen the potential, aside from the fact that the United States may not see multilateral relations as attractive as bilateral relations at this stage.\nBut we hope to achieve a balance at the meeting -- because, clearly, our possibilities -- the possibilities in relation to the growth of our relationship are vast. We can create a lot of jobs through increased trade with the United States and through U.S. companies, which have always led investment in Argentina over the past century. We hope that they will continue to invest further in Argentina.\nMODERATOR: Our next question -- David Rennie of The Economist.\nQ: A question for President Macri. You're probably the leader in Latin America that's closest to President Trump. You have an agenda that's very much aligned with free markets. You're proud of your meeting coming up hosting the WTO. Does it make your life harder when you're trying to speak to the anti-American forces that do exist in this continent when President Trump says things like the WTO is another one of our disasters, when he withdraws from TPP, when he has very harsh language about NAFTA that sounds protectionist, or when he says that a military option could be on the table for Venezuela? Does that make life harder for a pro-American leader like yourself in a continent like Latin America?\nAnd a similar question, Vice President. You're now going on this continent as an envoy of President Trump. You've been explaining how America First does not mean America alone. But when the President steps on his own message with things like the military options or when he gives people the impression he might be about to attack North Korea, does that mean that you have work to do? And have leaders told you that they're worried that America First looks and sounds like the ugly American of the past?\nPRESIDENT MACRI: (As interpreted.) I've had the honor and responsibility of leading the Argentine Republic for 19 months now. Right from the outset, I told the Argentine people that if we were isolated from the world the way we were for seven decades -- we didn't do very well, we did quite badly. One-third of Argentines are in poverty. And I propose intelligent mutual benefit relations with all countries all around the world, especially the countries that respect our own country; the countries that respect our own identity.\nAnd right from the start with the visit of President Obama, and then with the new administration that welcomed me in Washington -- and we were very warmly received not just by the President, but by the U.S. Congress, and the American community at-large, which showed a degree of interest and affection for our country that really touched us all -- let me say that we were truly moved.\nSo I would much rather focus on the fact that President Trump has reiterated his deep affection for Argentina, his great respect; the fact that he believes in our country. He sees our country as one with vast potential, and the United States wants to be part of that process of development and growth.\nSo we're at a very good stage. We are seeking commonalities. Trade will increase, as well as investment flows. We shall continue to work together in the fight against corruption, against drug trafficking, against organized crime generally, which afflicts us so much in our everyday lives.\nSo I think we have a very positive era ahead of us for both countries.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you for that, Mr. President. I couldn't agree more.\nWe do have before us a very opportune era, not only between our two countries, but across this hemisphere. And I believe it is a result of the strong leadership that President Donald Trump has brought back to the world stage as President of the United States of America.\nI've had the great privilege to represent the President in Europe now twice, in South Asia, and now here in Latin America. And what I hear again and again from leaders around the world is that they welcome -- they welcome American strength back on the world stage. In President Donald Trump, President Macri has known for a very long time we have an American President who says what he means, and means what he says.\nThe American people appreciate his strength, but I am convinced, from not only public events but private conversations with leaders around the world, free nations around the world welcome the President's leadership as well. In a very real sense, President Donald Trump has restored the credibility of American power and has demonstrated that America is once again willing to step onto the world stage, put our interests first -- as every President of every nation should put their people first -- but then bring together nations of common interests -- free nations around the world -- to pursue our common objectives.\nPresident Trump, in a very real sense, I believe has brought the kind of broad-shouldered leadership to the world stage that has been lacking for too long, and the world welcomes it. And it's my great honor to be able to represent him around the world.\nAnd the progress that we are seeing, the strengthening of our relationships and alliances, and, frankly, the result of the strengthening of an American economy -- more confidence among our businesses than it's been for some 20 years; one million new jobs created in the first seven months of this administration; and a world community once again understanding that America is embracing our role and our responsibility as leader of the free world -- I think is all evidence of what strong and resolute American leadership means. And that's the kind of leadership that President Donald Trump will continue to provide.\nPRESIDENT MACRI: (As interpreted.) Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2017-08-15", "title": "The Vice President's News Conference with and President Mauricio Macri of Argentina in Buenos Aires, Argentina"}
{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128013", "text": "VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you, Chargй Cooney, Minister Faurie, Hector Orlando, elected officials, distinguished leaders in the business community, and honored guests. It is my great honor -- and a great honor to my wife and I -- to be here today at the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange. Thank you for such a warm welcome, for both of us.\nIn fact, with that rousing round of applause, would you mind welcoming my wife of 32 years, the Second Lady of the United States of America? (Applause.) My wife Karen will be joining your First Lady later today, and she's already been enjoying the extraordinary experience of healthcare for children here in Buenos Aires, earlier today.\nThis is a historic moment of progress in Argentina and in freedom-loving countries across Latin America. And I'm grateful that each of you would take time to be with us today. And I bring greetings from the leader of the free world, the President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.\nThe President personally sent me here as the first member of our administration to visit South America, as a sign of our commitment to Latin America.\nOur Western Hemisphere is a key priority for our administration. Our values are the same, our interests are intertwined, and our futures are forever linked. And today, together, we have a historic opportunity for progress, from South America to Central America, all across North America, and I'm here to speak about that today. (Applause.)\nOver the course of this week, I'm visiting many of the United States' strongest allies and partners in South and Central America, including Colombia, Argentina, Chile, and Panama. And as I've already seen, the Americas are filled with diverse cultures, distinctive traditions, unique identities beyond number. But we are, all of us, bound by geography, by history, and we are bound together by the enduring aspiration for freedom.\nFreedom is more than just the heritage of the people of my country. It is the birthright and the legacy of all the peoples of this new world. (Applause.) We descend from the same pioneer spirit that moved our forebears to leave their families and homes and sail across the sea, all for the chance to build new lives in this new world.\nOur similar struggles for independence weave our different threads together in the same tapestry of freedom. In the long annals of liberty, names like San Martнn, Martн, and Bolнvar stand with Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln -- great leaders in the cause of freedom.\nIt was more than 240 years ago that the founders of the United States pledged to each other their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor to advance their God-given right to liberty. And it was only a few decades later that the forefathers of this country banded together to claim their inalienable right to freedom.\nMy nation's Declaration of Independence was followed only 40 years later, almost to the day, by Argentina's Acta de Independencia. And today, allow me to congratulate the Argentinian people as you, last year, celebrated 200 years of independence. (Applause.)\nEver since that day, the people of this nation, and this hemisphere, have strived for freedom and seized the chance to chart their own future. And that future is what I came here today to discuss.\nAs President Trump has said, the United States of America seeks, in his words, a future in our hemisphere where the people of each country can live out their dreams -- a future of freedom, security, and prosperity for us all. The United States has always cared deeply about the progress of our neighbors across the Americas.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States will always put the security and prosperity of America first. But as I hope my presence here today demonstrates, America first does not mean America alone. A secure Latin America means a more secure United States of America. A prosperous Latin America means a more prosperous United States of America. And the advance of freedom and democracy in Latin America benefits the cause of freedom everywhere. (Applause.) Because when free peoples stand together, there's nothing we can't accomplish.\nAnd today, the winds of progress are at our back. From Mexico to Argentina, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and in essentially every nation in between, the leaders of this region are taking historic action to improve the lives of their citizens and realize the hopes and dreams of generations past and present.\nAnd under President Trump, the United States is proud to work with you -- shoulder-to-shoulder and hand-in-hand -- for the benefit of our people, of this region, and the benefit of the world.\nThe tasks before us today are perhaps summarized in three ways:\nFirst, we must build on the bold steps taken by leaders across this region to open new pathways to prosperity for all of our citizens and a greater opportunity for commerce.\nSecond, we must continue to strengthen our collective security, by confronting those who threaten our people and our very way of life.\nAnd finally, we must jealously protect the time-honored values that unite us, and stand together to reject all who would discard freedom and democracy for tyranny and dictatorship.\nBut everything begins with prosperity. Economic growth is the essential ingredient for success in the United States, as well as Latin America. As President Trump often says, \"It's all about growth.\"\nA growing economy raises living standards of living and allows anyone who wants to strive and climb the ladder of success. A growing economy inspires innovators and entrepreneurs to move a society forward. A growing economy strengthens communities and gives families a reason to put down roots that over time will blossom and bear fruit for generations to come. And a growing economy empowers those in poverty to lift themselves upward toward prosperity.\nUnder the leadership of President Donald Trump, the American economy is growing again. Under this President's leadership, we've been rolling back excessive regulation, unleashing American energy, and laying the groundwork for historic tax relief -- all of which has renewed American confidence, higher than it's been in decades. It spurred the creation of more than one million new jobs this year alone, and seen the wealth of Americans on our stock market rise by trillions of dollars.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the American economy is back. And our trade is booming. Last year, the United States' two-way trade within the Western Hemisphere totaled $1.6 trillion, and the United States is the largest trading partner for nearly two-thirds of the hemisphere. In fact, we trade twice as much with the countries of North, Central, and South America as we do with China, and we export more to our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere than we do to all of Asia combined.\nOur flourishing trade relationship is the result of many factors, but one of the most important is the large number of U.S. free-trade agreements that facilitate commerce across this region.\nThe United States has free trade agreements with 12 countries in the Americas, and they've enhanced our commercial ties with the region, integrated our economies, and aligned our standards and regulatory practices in ways that have created growth.\nBut, as President Trump often says, every deal can be improved. And under his leadership, the United States is reviewing our existing trade agreements and negotiating new bilateral trade agreements to ensure a level playing field for the American people.\nPresident Trump has made it clear: In his words, \"We will uphold our values, we will defend our workers, and we will protect the innovations, creations, and inventions that power our magnificent country.\"\nThe United States wants more trade with Latin America and with the wider world. But under President Donald Trump, we'll not only have free trade, but we'll have fair trade.\nTo this end, yesterday President Trump directed the U.S. Trade Representative to determine whether to investigate China regarding the theft of American intellectual property. And that investigation has already begun. And just tomorrow, the United States will join with Canada and Mexico to formally begin the process of modernizing the North American Free Trade Agreement for the 21st Century.\nBut for commerce to expand, the United States needs to share our tradition of entrepreneurship, innovation, and transparency with Latin America -- because we know, when Latin America embraces economic reforms, Latin America succeeds, and so does the United States. And Latin America is succeeding, because the citizens of Latin America are choosing the same path that has made America prosperous.\nNever before in the history of our hemisphere have we seen such a concerted effort to enact the market-based reforms that open up opportunity, unleash prosperity, and empower the region's citizens to chart their own futures.\nSimply look here in Argentina. President Macri's leadership has brought a bold reform agenda to Argentina -- an agenda that is transforming Argentina's economy at home and restoring its reputation around the world.\nAs President Trump said to President Macri in their meeting in Washington, D.C., the United States of America applauds the political and economic reforms that President Macri and his government have brought here to Argentina. (Applause.)\nOver the past 18 months, President Macri has taken important steps to break down barriers to growth, eased currency controls, reentered global capital markets, cut import and export tariffs, modernized labor rules, and invested in much- needed infrastructure.\nAnd today, President Macri and I continued discussions on expanding agricultural trade between the United States and Argentina. And I can tell you, we are very close to completing an agreement that will benefit American pork producers and Argentinian consumers to strengthen the trade relationship between both our countries. (Applause.)\nThe truth is, Argentina has reemerged as a leading example of the productive and positive future that Latin America is building for itself. Furthermore, under President Macri's leadership, Argentina is once again a leader on the global stage.\nLater this year, Argentina will host the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference, and next year Argentina will assume the G-20's presidency.\nIn a very real sense, when it comes to Latin America, the model of Argentina is the future. But, fortunately, Argentina is not alone in pursuing pro-growth reforms across this region. The good news is that similar efforts are underway across Latin America, and the people of the region are choosing the path of progress and economic reform.\nIn Colombia, where I was yesterday, the government is leveraging peace to bring economic opportunity to the areas that have lacked it for decades.\nIn Brazil, structural reforms to the labor, fiscal, and pension systems are building a more open, integrated, and competitive economy.\nAnd when I met with leaders of the Northern Triangle nations of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in June, at the inaugural Conference on Prosperity and Security, those leaders all committed to improve the economic climate through historic regulatory and tax reforms.\nLatin America is on the move. And as all these nations continue to break down barriers, root out corruption, and unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of their citizens, the progress will be a win-win for the United States of America and all our neighbors in Latin America. (Applause.)\nThe truth is, U.S. businesses, like many of those gathered here, are already responding to these actions with renewed confidence and investment, supporting jobs in the United States and across Latin America.\nHere in Argentina, Viacom recently acquired the major broadcaster, Telefe -- one of the first major deals inked under President Macri's leadership. In the Vaca Muerta unconventional gas field, American companies, like Exxon and Chevron, are working together with their Argentinian counterparts to unleash affordable and abundant energy that will drive a growing economy.\nAnd beyond Argentina, U.S. companies are investing in Latin America like never before. Cargill recently announced major investments in Colombia, where it now employs some 5,000 people. In Panama, Caterpillar helped cut the new channel for the Panama Canal -- that great artery of commerce, so central to the prosperity of our hemisphere and the world.\nSuch investments, in a multitude of industries, will only grow as Argentina and Latin America continue to enact competitive, growth-oriented reforms. And this will further strengthen the economies of all of our nations, and it will strengthen the commerce and the significant trade relationships that we already enjoy.\nOur administration welcomes these economic reforms and we welcome the economic progress of Latin America. But we must never forget that security is the foundation of our prosperity, and here, too, the United States will not waver in our efforts to ensure the safety and security of the American people and the Western Hemisphere as a whole.\nFrom North Korea to Iran, the threats to our global security are numerous and growing. And no threat is more widespread than that of global terrorism.\nArgentina is no stranger to this enemy. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the bombing at the Israeli Embassy, which was followed two years later by the AMIA bombing -- the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of Argentina.\nThese two attacks claimed the lives of 114 innocents. And earlier today, it was my great honor to visit a memorial to these victims in the Metropolitan chapel, and breathe a prayer and read a verse in their memory.\nThe threat of terror still looms across our hemisphere, and we will stand together to confront it and protect our people from it. (Applause.)\nAnd so, too, must we stand together to confront the most immediate threat to Latin America's security and prosperity -- the menace of transnational crime.\nThe human cost of crime is incalculable in destroyed lives and in violence, but the economic cost is well-known. By some estimates, transnational crime now consumes up to 3 percent of the gross domestic product of South America and the Caribbean. In some Central American countries, the damage is more than double.\nThe cancer of crime and corruption will continue to stifle Latin America's progress so long as it exists. So every nation must redouble our efforts to end the scourge of corruption and transnational crime. And the United States of America will continue to partner with our neighbors in the region to achieve it. (Applause.)\nThe newly launched Argentina-United States Dialogue on Illicit Finance and Cyber Policy Working Group is helping us achieve this goal. And the United States is proud to assist President Macri in his campaign to crack down on drug trafficking and strengthen border controls.\nThe United States will also continue to work with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay to improve our intelligence-sharing cooperation to disrupt security threats.\nAnd to the north, in Colombia, the Caribbean, and Central America, the United States is continuing to coordinate with our partners to staunch the flow of illegal drugs, dismantle trafficking networks, and remove the cocaine fields that are the source of so much misery in our country and in countries across this region.\nLatin America has come so far in prosperity and security -- because today you share with the United States, in so many ways, in so many places, a renewed commitment to freedom, to democracy, and to the rule of law. These values are the foundation of a brighter future that we all seek, and so they will always be the foundation.\nBut while so much of Latin America has traveled the road to economic freedom and growth, in Venezuela, sadly, we're seeing tragedy. We're seeing the tragedy of tyranny play out before our eyes in our own hemisphere.\nAs President Trump has said, \"The [Venezuelan] people are suffering and they are dying.\" They're experiencing grinding poverty; families can't find the food and medicine they need to survive; innocent children are literally perishing every day from starvation and deprivation.\nJust yesterday, my wife and I spent time with refugees of this crisis in a small church in Cartagena. We prayed with these families that are fleeing violence, and poverty, and starvation.\nWe spoke to a grandmother who, just last week, reclaimed her grandchildren from Venezuela. And with tears in her eyes, she told us of how children would have to rise at four in the morning in Venezuela to get a ticket, and then wait all day to use that ticket in the afternoon to buy one piece of bread. It's extraordinary to think, in a nation that should well be one of the wealthiest nations in Latin America, to hear of such deprivation and poverty. It just broke our hearts.\nToday, the once-free people of Venezuela are being forced to endure that fate by the brutality of the Maduro regime. No free people has ever chosen to walk the path from prosperity to poverty. No free people has ever chosen to turn what was once, and should still be, one of South America's richest nations into one of its poorest and most corrupt.\nThe Maduro regime has ignored and undermined their National Assembly. They've stifled the voices of a free press and the people alike. They've imprisoned countless political opponents. And more than 130 brave Venezuelans have died in a desperate fight to restore their freedom.\nVenezuela is sliding into dictatorship. And as President Donald Trump has said, the United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles. (Applause.) We will continue to stand with free nations across our hemisphere until democracy is restored for the Venezuelan people.\nA failed state knows no boundaries. A failed state in Venezuela will drive more illegal drug trafficking with its murderous criminal consequences radiating outward across Latin America and into the United States. A failed state in Venezuela will drive more illegal migration, compromising our borders, and damaging our economies. And ultimately, a failed state in Venezuela will endanger the security, prosperity, and wellbeing of all of us who call the Western Hemisphere home.\nPresident Trump and I are grateful. We're grateful for Argentina's leadership in condemning the Maduro regime. We applaud the measures President Macri has taken to track down corrupt Venezuelan officials.\nWe're also grateful that Argentina voted with Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay to suspend Venezuela from Mercosur until democracy is restored.\nAnd we gratefully recognize Argentina for joining 11 other countries to sign the Lima Declaration just last week -- sending a powerful message that the free peoples of the Americas will stand with the Venezuelan people and we will stand up to their oppressors. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump and the United States calls on all of our neighbors across Latin America to do more. And you all can be assured: The United States of America will continue to bring the full measure of American economic and diplomatic power to bear until democracy is restored in Venezuela.\nAs President Trump said just a few days ago, \"We have many options for Venezuela.\" But the President also remains confident that, working with all of our allies across Latin America and across the wider world, that we can achieve a peaceable solution restoring democracy and ending the crisis facing the people of Venezuela. But it will take all of us to do it.\nAnd be assured: What we do to see democracy restored in Venezuela, we will do together. The United States of America has already issued three rounds of targeted sanctions, including new sanctions just last week, against Maduro and his inner circle. We will continue to act until the Maduro regime restores democracy, holds free and fair elections, releases all of its political prisoners, and ends the repression of the Venezuelan people.\nWe do this because it's right. The Venezuelan people deserve democracy. We do this because, as President Trump has said, a \"stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of our entire hemisphere.\"\nWe all live in the same neighborhood. We succeed when our neighbors succeed. We struggle when our neighbors struggle. And so we will continue to act, together, to support the people of Venezuela in their fight for freedom.\nAnd today, I say with confidence: The Venezuelan people will be free once more, for here in the new world, freedom always wins. (Applause.)\nAs Argentina knows, freedom is a precious gift that demands constant protection, steady vigilance. And today, as in ages past, the United States will be unwavering in our resolve to uphold freedom in this hemisphere.\nFreedom has always been and will always be the source of our strength, the summit of the national life of our country, the countries across this region. And it's the very heart of who we are. And as freedom continues its advance across this hemisphere, President Trump and I know it will bring us to new heights of security and prosperity for all our people, and new heights of accomplishment that will continue to be the marvel of the world.\nWe stand here today at the dawn of a new era in the new world, and the people of this hemisphere have a choice to make. It's the same choice that has faced us every day since two centuries and more ago of this nation's birth, and more than that, of my nation's birth. It's a choice that always demands our action and always commands our future.\nAnd so I say to our neighbors and friends across this hemisphere: Let us here, in the Western Hemisphere, always choose freedom. Let us always choose democracy. Let us always stand with those who stand with these timeless values.\nChoose the path that America has taken throughout our history. Choose the path that Argentina is now taking with renewed vigor once again. It's bringing this country and other Latin American countries to all new heights.\nWe need only remember the words of San Martнn, whose mausoleum I had the privilege of visiting earlier today. As the great hero of liberty in this land tells us, \"Let us be free -- for the rest matters not.\"\nMy friends, the future of freedom beckons us all. And with confidence in the good people of the United States, of Argentina, and freedom-loving people all across Latin America, with firm reliance on the deep wellspring of faith in almighty God, with such a rich tradition in all the nations across this new world -- I know we will meet that glorious future of freedom together, as partners and as friends.\nThank you. May God bless you. May God bless all of Latin America. And may God bless the United States of America.

Trump\nMODERNIZING AN OUTDATED SYSTEM: The old system for completing environmental reviews was fragmented, inefficient, and unpredictable to the American people.\n* The Federal Government currently lacks a system for tracking the costs of the environmental review and permitting process for major infrastructure projects.\n* The Executive Order will require agencies to track the costs of conducting environmental reviews and making permitting decisions.\n* With regulatory red tape to jump through, major infrastructure projects are held up for years at significant cost to our economy.\n* According to a 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, it takes 7 years on average for a complex highway project to go through the entire environmental review process.\n* According to the National Association of Environmental Professionals, a single agency can take 3.7 to 5 years on average to complete an environmental review.\n* One study has found that the average delay of six years for major infrastructure projects costs the U.S. economy trillions.\nREMOVING ROADBLOCKS TO IMPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order Establishing Discipline and Accountability In the Environmental Review and Permitting Process for Infrastructure Projects.\n* The Executive Order will make the environmental and permitting processes needed for major infrastructure projects more efficient and effective..\n* Rather than allow for a patchwork of agency reviews, this Order implements a One Federal Decision policy under which the lead Federal agency will work with other relevant Federal agencies to complete the environmental reviews and permitting decisions needed for major infrastructure projects.\n* Each agency will sign a joint Record of Decision and all required Federal permits will be issued 90 days later.\n* The order establishes a two-year goal to process environmental documents for major infrastructure projects.\n* The entire environmental review and permitting process will be reviewed to improve performance across the government and hold every Agency accountable. Under this order:\n* The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) will develop and implement an action plan to improve environmental reviews Government-wide.\n* The CEQ: will mediate disagreements between Federal agencies so a decision isn't delayed amid bureaucratic disputes.\n* The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will develop a two-year Government-wide modernization goal and ensure Federal agencies take meaningful steps to achieve it.\n* Agencies will modify their strategic plans to include agency-specific goals for improving environmental review and permitting processes, and hold their officials accountable.\n* OMB will establish a performance accountability system and score each agency on their implementation of the Executive Order. Poor performance will be considered in budget formulation and could result in the imposition of available penalties.\n* Agencies will also be held accountable for implementing appropriate best practices that are proven to enhance the environmental review and permitting process.\n* The Executive Order makes clear that environmental protections will be maintained, and that the process should focus more on decision-making and good environmental outcomes rather than bureaucratic process.\nBUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS: President Trump has made infrastructure a priority and has taken action to rebuild America.\n* President Trump has unleashed oil and gas development in the United States by expanding access to resources and the infrastructure needed to get them to market.\n* Approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, which is estimated to create over 42,000 jobs and $2 billion in earnings.\n* Signed an Executive Order mandating future pipeline work to be done by American workers and with American steel.\n* Expedited new pipeline approval and production, such as the New Burgos Pipeline to Mexico.\n* The President has dedicated $200 billion in his budget as part of a $1 trillion investment plan to rebuild infrastructure.\n* The Federal Government will help bring transformative projects to market that will bring the country's infrastructure into the 21st century.\n* Rural America will receive grants to rebuild crippled bridges, roads, and waterways.\n* States and cities will receive grants to meet their own infrastructure challenges.\n* Qualified projects of regional and national significance, such as those created under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, will receive loans.\n* Government will get out of the way to allow State and local governments to succeed at meeting their unique challenges.\n* Only 1/5 of infrastructure spending comes from the Federal Government, the vast majority comes from states, localities, and the private sector.", "timestamp": "2017-08-15", "title": "Press Release - Fact Sheet: President Donald J.

Spencer, chairman, National Policy Institute.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126765", "text": "The President. Hello, everybody. Great to be back in New York with all of our friends and some great friends outside the building, I must tell you. I want to thank all of our distinguished guests who are with us today, including members of our Cabinet: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, and of course, our Transportation Secretary—who is doing a fabulous job—Elaine Chao.\nThank you all for doing a really incredible and creative job on what we're going to be discussing today, which is infrastructure. We've just had a great set of briefings upstairs on our infrastructure agenda. My administration is working every day to deliver the world-class infrastructure that our people deserve and, frankly, that our country deserves.\nThat's why I just signed a new Executive order to dramatically reform the Nation's badly broken infrastructure permitting process. Just blocks away is the Empire State Building. It took 11 months to build the Empire State Building. But today, it can take as long as a decade and much more than that—many, many stories where it takes 20 and 25 years—just to get approvals to start construction of a fairly routine highway. Highway builders must get up to 16 different approvals involving 9 different Federal agencies governed by 29 different statutes. One agency alone can stall a project for many, many years and even decades.\nNot only does this cost our economy billions of dollars, but it also denies our citizens the safe and modern infrastructure they deserve. This overregulated permitting process is a massive self-inflicted wound on our country—it's disgraceful—denying our people much-needed investments in their community.\nAnd I just want to show you this, because it was just shown to me, and I said, I think I'm going to show it to the media, both real and fake media, by the way.\n[At this point, the President displayed a flowchart illustrating the permitting process for a federally funded highway project.]\nThis is what it takes to get something approved today. Elaine, you see that? So this is what it takes. Permitting process flowchart—that's a flowchart. So that can go out to 20 years. This shows about 10, but that can go out to about 20 years to get something approved. This is for a highway. I've seen a highway recently in a certain State—I won't mention its name—it's 17 years. I could have built it for 4 or 5 million dollars without the permitting process. It cost hundreds of millions of dollars, but it took 17 years to get it approved and many, many, many, many pages of environmental impact studies.\n[The President dropped the longer flowchart to the floor and displayed a shorter flowchart illustrating a streamlined permitting process.]\nThis is what we will bring it down to. This is less than 2 years. This is going to happen quickly. That's what I'm signing today. This will be less than 2 years for a highway. So it's going to be quick; it's going to be a very streamlined process. And by the way, if it doesn't meet environmental safeguards, we're not going to approve it. Very simple. We're not going to approve it. So this is—maybe this one we'll save, let's throw the other one away. Would anybody like it from the media? [Laughter] Would anybody like that long, beautiful chart? You can have it.\nSo my Executive order also requires agencies to work together efficiently by requiring one lead agency for each major infrastructure project. It also holds agencies accountable if they fail to streamline their review process. So each agency is accountable. We're going to get infrastructure built quickly, inexpensively—relatively speaking—and the permitting process will go very, very quickly.\nNo longer will we tolerate one job-killing delay after another. No longer will we accept a broken system that benefits consultants and lobbyists at the expense of hard-working Americans.\nNow, I knew the process very well, probably better than anybody. I had to get permits for this building and many of the buildings I built—all of the buildings I built—in Manhattan and many other places. And I will tell you that the consultants are rich people. They go around making it very difficult. They lobby Congress, they lobby State governments, city governments to make it very difficult so that you have to hire consultants and that you have to take years and pay them a fortune. So we're streamlining the process, and we won't be having so much of that anymore.\nNo longer will we allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and decay. While protecting the environment, we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, railways, waterways, tunnels, and highways. We will rebuild our country with American workers, American iron, American aluminum, American steel. We will create millions of new jobs and make millions of American dreams come true.\nOur infrastructure will again be the best in the world. We used to have the greatest infrastructure anywhere in the world, and today, we're like a third-world country. We are literally like a third-world country. Our infrastructure will again be the best, and we will restore the pride in our communities, our Nation. And all over the United States, we'll be proud again.\nSo I want to thank everybody for being here. God bless you. God bless the United States.\nAnd if you have any questions, we have—Mick, you could come up here please. Come on up. Mick Mulvaney.\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask.\nThe President's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative Advisory Council\nQ. Mr. President, why do you think these CEOs are leaving your manufacturing council?\nThe President. Because they're not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country. And we want jobs, manufacturing in this country. If you look at some of those people that you're talking about, they're outside of the country, they're having a lot of their product made outside. If you look at Merck as an example, take a look where——\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Excuse me, excuse me—take a look at where their product is made. It's made outside of our country. We want products made in the country.\nNow, I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, they're leaving out of embarrassment, because they make their products outside. And I've been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you're referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country. You can't do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places. You have to bring this work back to this country. That's what I want. I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit.\nThe President's Response to the Situation in Charlottesville, VA\nQ. Let me ask you, Mr. President, why did you wait so long to blast neo-Nazis?\nQ. Why do Nazis like you?\nThe President. I didn't wait long.\nQ. Why do Nazis like you?\nQ. You waited 2 days——\nThe President. I didn't wait long.\nQ. Forty-eight hours.\nThe President. I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement. But you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don't know the facts. And it's a very, very important process to me, and it's a very important statement.\nSo I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts. If you go back to——\nQ. So you had to—[inaudible]—White supremacists?\nThe President. I brought it. I brought it. I brought it.\n[The President removed a sheet of paper from his breast pocket.]\nQ. Was it terrorism?\nQ. What did you bring, Mr. President?\nQ. Was it terrorism, in your opinion, what happened?\nThe President. As I said on—remember, Saturday——\n[The President read from the sheet of paper.]\n\"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence. It has no place in America.\"\nAnd then, I went on from there. Now, here's the thing——\nQ. [Inaudible]—on many sides.\nThe President. Excuse me. Excuse me. Take it nice and easy. Here's the thing: When I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts. This event just happened. In fact, a lot of the event didn't even happen yet, as we were speaking. This event just happened.\nBefore I make a statement, I need the facts. So I don't want to rush into a statement. So making the statement when I made it was excellent. In fact, the young woman, who I hear is a fantastic young woman, and it was on NBC——\nQ. Have you called her family yet? The President. ——her mother wrote me and said through, I guess, Twitter, social media, the nicest things. And I very much appreciated that. I hear she was a fine—really, actually, an incredible—young woman. But her mother, on Twitter, thanked me for what I said.\nQ. But White nationalists——\nThe President. And honestly, if the press were not fake, and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice. But unlike you, and unlike——\n[Many reporters began speaking at once.]\nExcuse me, unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts.\nNeo-Nazi Groups/Infrastructure\nQ. Why do Nazis like you—[inaudible]—these statements?\nThe President. They don't. They don't.\nQ. They do. Look——\nQ. Richard Spencer has praised you. David Duke has praised you.\nThe President. How about a couple of infrastructure questions?\nThe President's Response to the Situation in Charlottesville, VA/National Economy/Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., President and Chief Executive Officer C. Douglas McMillon\nQ. Was it terrorism, that event? Was that terrorism?\nQ. The CEO of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity——\nThe President. Say it. What?\nQ. The CEO of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity to help bring the country together. Did you?\nThe President. Not at all. I think the country—look, you take a look. I've created over a million jobs since I'm President. The country is booming. The stock market is setting records. We have the highest employment numbers we've ever had in the history of our country. We're doing record business. We have the highest levels of enthusiasm. So the head of Walmart, who I know—who's a very nice guy—was making a political statement. I mean, ask him how he's doing——\nThe President's Response to the Situation in Charlottesville, VA\nQ. So if you had to do it again—[inaudible]?\nThe President. I'd do it the same way. And you know why? Because I want to make sure, when I make a statement, that the statement is correct. And there was no way——\nQ. Why——\nThe President. There was no way of making a correct statement that early. I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters. Unlike a lot of reporters——\nFormer Ku Klux Klan Leader David Duke/The President's Response to the Situation in Charlottesville, VA Q. David Duke was there. David Duke was there, Mr. President.\nQ. They held a march with torches, sir. And—[inaudible].\nQ. Nazis were there.\nThe President. I didn't know David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts. And the facts, as they started coming out, were very well stated. In fact, everybody said: \"His statement was beautiful. If he would have made it sooner, that would have been good.\" I couldn't have made it sooner because I didn't know all of the facts. Frankly, people still don't know all of the facts.\n[Many reporters began speaking at once.]\nIt was very important—excuse me, excuse me—it was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly. Because if I would have made a fast statement—and the first statement was made without knowing much, other than what we were seeing. The second statement was made after, with knowledge, with great knowledge.\nQ. But why say—[inaudible]—\"on many sides\"?\nThe President. There are still things——\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Excuse me—there are still things that people don't know.\nQ. What was the—[inaudible].\nThe President. I want to make a statement with knowledge. I wanted to know the facts. Okay.\nCivil Unrest and Violence in Charlottesville, VA\nQ. [Inaudible]—saying many sides.\nQ. Was this terrorism? Two questions. Was this terrorism? And can you tell us how you're feeling about your Chief Strategist, Stephen Bannon?\nThe President. Well, I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family, and this country. And that is—you can call it terrorism. You can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want. I would just call it as \"the fastest one to come up with a good verdict.\" That's what I'd call it. Because there is a question: Is it murder? Is it terrorism? And then, you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer. And what he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing.\nWhite House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon\nQ. Mr. Trump, can you tell us how you're feeling about your Chief Strategist, Mr. Bannon? Can you talk about that?\nThe President. Go ahead.\nQ. I would echo Maggie's [Maggie Haberman, New York Times] question. Steve Bannon has come under——\nThe President. I never spoke to Mr. Bannon about it.\nQ. Can you tell us broadly what you're feeling—do you still have confidence in Steve? The President. Well, we'll see. Look, look, I like Mr. Bannon. He's a friend of mine. But Mr. Bannon came on very late. You know that. I went through 17 Senators, Governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that. And I like him, he's a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that. He's a good person. He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard. But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon. But he's a good person, and I think the press treats him, frankly, very unfairly.\nNational Security Adviser H.R. McMaster/Senator John S. McCain III/Health Care Reform Legislation\nQ. Do you have confidence in him?\nQ. Senator McCain has called on you to defend your National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster, against these attacks.\nThe President. I've already done it. I did it the last time.\nQ. And he called on it again, linking——\nThe President. Senator McCain?\nQ. ——to the alt-right, and saying he's——\nThe President. Senator McCain?\nQ. Yes.\nThe President. You mean the one who voted against Obamacare?\nQ. And he said——\nThe President. Who is Senator—you mean Senator McCain who voted against us getting good health care?\nSenator John S. McCain III/Alt-Right Political Movement\nQ. Senator McCain said that the alt-right is behind these attacks, and he linked that same group to those who perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville.\nThe President. Well, I don't know. I can't tell you. I'm sure Senator McCain must know what he's talking about. But when you say the alt-right, define \"alt-right\" to me. You define it. Go ahead.\nQ. Well, I'm saying, as Senator——\nThe President. No, define it for me. Come on, let's go. Define it for me.\nCivil Unrest and Violence in Charlottesville, VA\nQ. Senator McCain defined them as the same group——\nThe President. Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at them—excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?\nQ. But, sir, sir——\nQ. This was Senator McCain's statement, sir. The President. Let me ask you this: What about the fact they came charging—that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. So, you know, as far as I'm concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day.\nQ. You're not putting these——\nThe President. Wait a minute. I'm not finished. I'm not finished, fake news. That was a horrible day——\nQ. Sir, you're not putting these protestors on the same level as neo-Nazis——\nQ. Is the alt-left as bad as White supremacists?\nThe President. I will tell you something. I watched those very closely, much more closely than you people watched it. And you have—you had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now. You had a group on the other side that came charging in, without a permit, and they were very, very violent.\nQ. Is the alt-left as bad as Nazis?\nThe President. Go ahead.\nCivil Unrest and Violence in Charlottesville, VA/Removal of Confederate Monuments\nQ. Do you think that what you call the alt-left is the same as neo-Nazis?\nThe President. Those people—all of those people—excuse me, I've condemned neo-Nazis. I've condemned many different groups. But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were White supremacists by any stretch.\nQ. Well, White nationalists——\nThe President. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue, Robert E. Lee.\nQ. Should that statue be taken down?\nThe President. So—excuse me. And you take a look at some of the groups, and you'd see—and you'd know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases you're not—but many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.\nSo this week, it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\nQ. Mr. President——\nThe President. But they were there to protest—excuse me—you take a look, the night before they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.\nInfrastructure question. Go ahead.\nRemoval of Confederate Monuments\nQ. Should statues of Robert E. Lee stay up?\nThe President. I would say that's up to a local town, community, or the Federal Government, depending on where it is located. Race Relations/Job Creation and Growth/Aid to Inner Cities\nQ. Are you against the Confederacy?\nQ. How concerned are you about race relations in America? And do you think things have gotten worse or better since you took office?\nThe President. I think they've gotten better or the same. I—look, they've been frayed for a long time. And you can ask President Obama about that, because he'd make speeches about it. But I believe that the fact that I brought in—it will be soon—millions of jobs—you see where companies are moving back into our country—I think that's going to have a tremendous, positive impact on race relations.\nWe have companies coming back into our country. We have two car companies that just announced. We have Foxconn in Wisconsin just announced. We have many companies, I say, pouring back into the country. I think that's going to have a huge, positive impact on race relations. You know why? It's jobs. What people want now, they want jobs. They want great jobs with good pay, and when they have that, you watch how race relations will be.\nAnd I'll tell you, we're spending a lot of money on the inner cities. We're going to fix—we're fixing the inner cities. We're doing far more than anybody has done with respect to the inner cities. It's a priority for me, and it's very important.\nCivil Unrest and Violence in Charlottesville, VA\nQ. Mr. President——\nQ. Mr. President, are you putting what you're calling the alt-left and White supremacists on the same moral plane?\nThe President. I'm not putting anybody on a moral plane. What I'm saying is this: You had a group on one side, and you had a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs. And it was vicious, and it was horrible. And it was a horrible thing to watch.\nBut there is another side. There was a group on this side. You can call them the left—you've just called them the left—that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but that's the way it is.\nQ. Mr. President, in your words——\nQ. [Inaudible]—on both sides, sir. You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides. Are the——\nThe President. Well, I do think there's blame—yes, I think there's blame on both sides.\nQ. Is there bigotry on both sides?\nThe President. If you look at both sides, I think there's blame on both sides. And I have no doubt about it, and you don't have any doubt about it either.\nQ. Mr. President, but only the Nazis——\nThe President. And if you reported it accurately, you would say——\nCivil Unrest and Violence in Charlottesville, VA/Removal of Confederate Monuments\nQ. But as for bigotry, the neo-Nazis started this. They showed up in Charlottesville to protest the removal of that statue—— The President. Excuse me, excuse me. They didn't put themselves down as you do, and you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. You had people in that group——\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.\nQ. George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same, Mr. President.\nThe President. No, George Washington was a slave owner.\nQ. But sir——\nThe President. Was George Washington a slave owner?\nQ. Yes, he was.\nThe President. So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down——\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Excuse me, are we going to take down statues to George Washington?\nQ. Symbols of the Confederacy are very important to them.\nThe President. How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him?\nQ. I do love Thomas Jefferson, of course.\nThe President. Okay, good. Are we going to take down the statue? Because he was a major slave owner. Now, are we going to take down his statue?\nQ. Mr. President——\nThe President. So you know what, it's fine. You're changing history. You're changing culture. And you had people—and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the White nationalists, because they should be condemned totally—but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and White nationalists. Okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.\nQ. What——\nThe President. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people. But you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats. You had a lot of bad people in the other group.\nCivil Unrest and Violence in Charlottesville, VA\nQ. Who are the good people? Who are the good people?\nQ. Sir, I'm sorry. I just didn't understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated White nationalists unfairly?\nThe President. No.\nQ. I just don't understand what you were saying. The President. No. There were people in that rally—and I looked the night before—if you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. I'm sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people: neo-Nazis, White nationalists, whatever you want to call them.\nBut you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest—because you know, I don't know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn't have a permit. So I only tell you this: There are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country, a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country.\nDoes anybody have a final——\nHealth Care Reform Legislation/Infrastructure Legislation\nQ. I have an infrastructure question.\nThe President. You have an infrastructure——\nQ. What makes you think you can get an infrastructure bill? You didn't get health care, you're struggling on tax reform.\nThe President. Well, you know, I'll tell you. We came very close with health care. Unfortunately, John McCain decided to vote against it at the last minute. You'll have to ask John McCain why he did that. But we came very close to health care. We will end up getting health care. But we'll get the infrastructure. And actually, infrastructure is something that I think we'll have bipartisan support on. I actually think Democrats will go along with the infrastructure.\nCivil Unrest and Violence in Charlottesville, VA\nQ. Mr. President, have you spoke to the family—have you spoken to the family of the victim of the car attack?\nThe President. No, I'll be reaching out. I'll be reaching out.\nQ. When will you be reaching out?\nThe President. I was very—I thought that the statement put out—the mother's statement I thought was a beautiful statement. I must tell you, it was something that I really appreciated. I thought it was terrific. And really, under the kind of stress that she's under and the heartache that she's under, I thought putting out that statement, to me, was really something I won't forget.\nThank you, all, very much. Thank you. Thank you.\n[As the President walked away from the podium, his exchange with reporters continued follows.]\nThe President's Property in Charlottesville, VA\nQ. Mr. President, do you think you're helping to heal the Nation?\nQ. Will you go to Charlottesville?\nThe President. I own a house in Charlottesville.\nQ. Will you go to check out what happened? The President. Does anyone know I own a house in Charlottesville?\nQ. Where is it?\nThe President. Oh boy, it's going to be——\nQ. Where is it?\nThe President. It's in Charlottesville. You'll see.\nQ. You do? Is it near the winery or something?\nThe President. It is the winery.\nQ. Will you go to visit and try to just——\nThe President. I mean, I know a lot about Charlottesville. Charlottesville is a great place that's been very badly hurt over the last couple of days.\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. I own, actually, one of the largest wineries in the United States. It's in Charlottesville.\nJob Creation and Growth/Race Relations\nQ. Why was that image of a German-speaking—[inaudible]—retweeted?\nQ. Do you believe your words are helping to heal this country right now?\nQ. What do you think needs to be done to overcome the racial divides in this country?\nThe President. Well, I really think jobs can have a big impact. I think if we continue to create jobs—over a million, substantially more than a million. And you see just the other day, the car companies coming in, you know, with Foxconn. I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I'm creating jobs, I think that's going to have a tremendous impact—positive impact on race relations.\nQ. And what you said today, how do you think that will impact the racial, sort of, conflict, today?\nThe President. The people are going to be working, they're going to be making a lot of money—much more money than they ever thought possible. But that's going to happen.\nQ. But I mean, your remarks today.\nThe President. And the other thing—very important—I believe wages will start going up. They haven't gone up for a long time. I believe wages now—because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up. I think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.", "timestamp": "2017-08-15", "title": "Remarks on Infrastructure and an Exchange With Reporters in New York City"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "This Executive order was published in the  Federal Register  on August 24.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=126764", "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure that the Federal environmental review and permitting process for infrastructure projects is coordinated, predictable, and transparent, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1. Purpose. America needs increased infrastructure investment to strengthen our economy, enhance our competitiveness in world trade, create jobs and increase wages for our workers, and reduce the costs of goods and services for our families. The poor condition of America's infrastructure has been estimated to cost a typical American household thousands of dollars each year. Inefficiencies in current infrastructure project decisions, including management of environmental reviews and permit decisions or authorizations, have delayed infrastructure investments, increased project costs, and blocked the American people from enjoying improved infrastructure that would benefit our economy, society, and environment. More efficient and effective Federal infrastructure decisions can transform our economy, so the Federal Government, as a whole, must change the way it processes environmental reviews and authorization decisions.\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the Federal Government to:\n(a) safeguard our communities and maintain a healthy environment;\n(b) ensure that Federal authorities make informed decisions concerning the environmental impacts of infrastructure projects;\n(c) develop infrastructure in an environmentally sensitive manner;\n(d) provide transparency and accountability to the public regarding environmental review and authorization decisions;\n(e) be good stewards of public funds, including those used to develop infrastructure projects, and avoid duplicative and wasteful processes;\n(f) conduct environmental reviews and authorization processes in a coordinated, consistent, predictable, and timely manner in order to give public and private investors the confidence necessary to make funding decisions for new infrastructure projects;\n(g) speak with a coordinated voice when conducting environmental reviews and making authorization decisions; and\n(h) make timely decisions with the goal of completing all Federal environmental reviews and authorization decisions for major infrastructure projects within 2 years.\nSec. 3. Definitions. The terms of this order shall be applied consistently with those defined under 42 U.S.C. 4370m and implementing guidance to the maximum extent possible. The following definitions shall specifically apply:\n(a) \"Authorization\" means any license, permit, approval, finding, determination, or other administrative decision issued by a Federal department or agency (agency) that is required or authorized under Federal law in order to site, construct, reconstruct, or commence operations of an infrastructure project, including any authorization under 42 U.S.C. 4370m(3).\n(b) \"CAP Goals\" means Federal Government Priority Goals established by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010, Public Law 111-352, 124 Stat. 3866, and commonly referred to as Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals.\n(c) \"Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council\" or \"FPISC\" means the entity established under 42 U.S.C. 4370m-1.\n(d) \"Infrastructure project\" means a project to develop the public and private physical assets that are designed to provide or support services to the general public in the following sectors: surface transportation, including roadways, bridges, railroads, and transit; aviation; ports, including navigational channels; water resources projects; energy production and generation, including from fossil, renewable, nuclear, and hydro sources; electricity transmission; broadband internet; pipelines; stormwater and sewer infrastructure; drinking water infrastructure; and other sectors as may be determined by the FPISC.\n(e) \"Major infrastructure project\" means an infrastructure project for which multiple authorizations by Federal agencies will be required to proceed with construction, the lead Federal agency has determined that it will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and the project sponsor has identified the reasonable availability of funds sufficient to complete the project.\n(f) \"Permitting timetable\" means an environmental review and authorization schedule, or other equivalent schedule, for a project or group of projects that identifies milestones—including intermediate and final completion dates for action by each agency on any Federal environmental review or authorization required for a project or group of projects—that is prepared by the lead Federal agency in consultation with all cooperating and participating agencies.\nSec. 4. Agency Performance Accountability. Federal agencies should follow transparent and coordinated processes for conducting environmental reviews and making authorization decisions. These processes must include early and open coordination among Federal, State, tribal, and local agencies and early engagement with the public. Holding Federal agencies accountable for their progress on implementing the policy set forth in section 2 of this order should, among other things, produce measurably better environmental outcomes with respect to infrastructure development.\n(a) Performance Priority Goals.\n(i) CAP Goal. A CAP Goal is a Federal tool for accelerating progress in priority areas that require active collaboration among multiple agencies to overcome organizational barriers and to achieve better performance than one agency could achieve on its own. Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the FPISC, shall establish a CAP Goal on Infrastructure Permitting Modernization so that, where permitted by law:\n(A) Federal environmental reviews and authorization processes for infrastructure projects are consistent, coordinated, and predictable; and\n(B) the time for the Federal Government's processing of environmental reviews and authorization decisions for new major infrastructure projects should be reduced to not more than an average of approximately 2 years, measured from the date of the publication of a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement or other benchmark deemed appropriate by the Director of OMB.\n(ii) Agency Goals. All Federal agencies with environmental review, authorization, or consultation responsibilities for infrastructure projects shall modify their Strategic Plans and Annual Performance Plans under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 to include agency performance goals related to the completion of environmental reviews and authorizations for infrastructure projects consistent with the new CAP Goal on Infrastructure Permitting Modernization. The agencies shall integrate the achievement of these performance goals into appropriate agency personnel performance plans, such as those of the agency Chief Environmental Review and Permitting Officers (CERPOs) or other appropriate officials, consistent with guidance to be provided by OMB, in consultation with the Office of Personnel Management. Progress on these goals shall be reviewed and analyzed by agency leadership, pursuant to the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010.\n(b) Accountability. Within 180 days of the establishment of the CAP Goal on Infrastructure Permitting Modernization, as described in subsection (a) of this section, or such longer period of time as determined by the Director of OMB, OMB, in consultation with the FPISC, shall issue guidance for establishing a performance accountability system to facilitate achievement of the CAP Goal.\n(i) Tracking of Major Infrastructure Projects. The performance accountability system shall track each major infrastructure project. The performance accountability system shall include, at a minimum, assessments of the agency's performance with respect to each of the following areas, as applicable:\n(A) whether major infrastructure projects are processed using the \"One Federal Decision\" mechanism, as described in subsection 5(b) of this order;\n(B) whether major infrastructure projects have a permitting timetable;\n(C) whether major infrastructure projects follow an effective process that automatically elevates instances in which permitting timetable milestones are missed or extended, or are anticipated to be missed or extended, to appropriate senior agency officials;\n(D) whether agencies are meeting the established milestones in the permitting timetable;\n(E) the time it takes to complete the processing of environmental reviews and authorizations for each major infrastructure project; and\n(F) the costs of the environmental reviews and authorizations for each major infrastructure project.\n(ii) Scoring. The accountability system shall include a scoring mechanism that shall follow, at a minimum, the following procedures:\n(A) agencies will submit information to OMB, consistent with existing reporting mechanisms to the maximum extent possible, on the assessment areas described in subsection (b)(i) of this section; (B) at least once per quarter, OMB will produce a scorecard of agency performance and overall progress toward achieving CAP Goal targets;\n(C) where an agency's inability to meet a permitting timetable milestone results in a significant delay of the project timeline, after consulting with the project sponsor and relevant agencies, agencies will submit (based on OMB guidance) an estimate of the delay's costs to the project; and\n(D) the Director of OMB will consider each agency's performance during budget formulation and determine whether appropriate penalties, including those authorized at 23 U.S.C. 139(h)(7) and 33 U.S.C. 2348(h)(5), must or should be imposed, to the extent required or permitted by law, for those that significantly fail to meet a permitting timetable milestone or in other situations deemed appropriate by the Director of OMB after considering the causes of any poor performance.\n(iii) Best Practices. Agencies shall implement the techniques and strategies the FPISC annually identifies as best practices pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4370m-1(c)(2)(B), as appropriate. The performance accountability system shall track and score agencies on the incorporation and implementation of appropriate best practices for all infrastructure projects, including the implementation of such best practices at an agency's field level.\nSec. 5. Process Enhancements. In furtherance of the policy described in section 2 of this order, Federal agencies shall follow a more unified environmental review and authorization process.\n(a) Processing of Major Infrastructure Projects. In processing environmental reviews and authorizations for major infrastructure projects, Federal agencies shall:\n(i) use \"One Federal Decision\" described in subsection (b) of this section;\n(ii) develop and follow a permitting timetable, which shall be reviewed and updated at least quarterly by the lead Federal agency in consultation with Federal cooperating and participating agencies; and\n(iii) follow an effective process that automatically elevates instances where a permitting timetable milestone is missed or extended, or is anticipated to be missed or extended, to appropriate senior agency officials of the lead Federal agency and the cooperating and participating Federal agency or agencies to which the milestone applies.\n(b) One Federal Decision.\n(i) Each major infrastructure project shall have a lead Federal agency, which shall be responsible for navigating the project through the Federal environmental review and authorization process, including the identification of a primary Federal point of contact at each Federal agency. All Federal cooperating and participating agencies shall identify points of contact for each project, cooperate with the lead Federal agency point of contact, and respond to all reasonable requests for information from the lead Federal agency in a timely manner.\n(ii) With respect to the applicability of NEPA to a major infrastructure project, the Federal lead, cooperating, and participating agencies for each major infrastructure project shall all record any individual agency decision in one Record of Decision (ROD), which shall be coordinated by the lead Federal agency unless the project sponsor requests that agencies issue separate NEPA documents, the NEPA obligations of a cooperating or participating agency have already been satisfied, or the lead Federal agency determines that a single ROD would not best promote completion of the project's environmental review and authorization process. The Federal lead, cooperating, and participating agencies shall all agree to a permitting timetable that includes the completion dates for the ROD and the federally required authorizations for the project.\n(iii) All Federal authorization decisions for the construction of a major infrastructure project shall be completed within 90 days of the issuance of a ROD by the lead Federal agency, provided that the final EIS includes an adequate level of detail to inform agency decisions pursuant to their specific statutory authority and requirements. The lead Federal agency may extend the 90-day deadline if the lead Federal agency determines that Federal law prohibits the agency from issuing its approval or permit within the 90-day period, the project sponsor requests that the permit or approval follow a different timeline, or the lead Federal agency determines that an extension would better promote completion of the project's environmental review and authorization process.\n(iv) The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and OMB shall develop the framework for implementing One Federal Decision, in consultation with the FPISC.\n(A) The framework should be consistent with the model processes established under 42 U.S.C. 4370m-2, 23 U.S.C. 139, 33 U.S.C. 2348, the 2015 \"Red Book\" (officially entitled \"Synchronizing Environmental Reviews for Transportation and Other Infrastructure Projects\"), and CEQ guidance on efficient and timely environmental reviews under NEPA.\n(B) The framework shall also include guidance on the development of permitting timetables by the lead Federal agencies, in collaboration with Federal cooperating and participating agencies. Permitting timetables shall identify estimated intermediate and final completion dates for all environmental reviews and authorizations that are reasonably anticipated as being needed for a project, including the process for granting extensions of any established dates. The guidance shall specify that lead Federal agencies need not include the estimated intermediate and final completion dates of any such reviews or authorizations until the design of a project has sufficiently advanced so that they can be developed. In such cases, the guidance shall instruct lead Federal agencies to estimate when the project's design will be advanced enough to determine such dates. The timelines shall account for any federally required decisions or permits that are assumed by, or delegated to, State, tribal, or local agencies and the extent to which any approval or permit to be issued by a Federal agency is dependent upon the issuance of such a decision or permit.\n(C) CEQ and OMB shall also develop guidance for applying One Federal Decision whenever the lead agency is a State, tribal, or local agency exercising an assignment or delegation of an agency's NEPA responsibilities.\n(c) Dashboard. All projects subject to 23 U.S.C. 139 and \"covered projects\" under 42 U.S.C. 4370m shall be tracked on the Dashboard established under 42 U.S.C. 4370m-2(b). Other projects or classes of projects subject to special environmental review and authorization streamlining processes similar to those referenced in this subsection may also be tracked on the Dashboard at the discretion of the FPISC Executive Director. The dates for milestones of all projects tracked on the Dashboard shall be updated monthly, or on another appropriate timeline as may be determined by the FPISC Executive Director.\n(d) Executive Order 13766. For purposes of implementing Executive Order 13766 of January 24, 2017 (Expediting Environmental Reviews and Approvals for High Priority Infrastructure Projects), all infrastructure projects that meet the criteria for, and are subject to, 23 U.S.C. 139, 33 U.S.C. 2348, or 42 U.S.C. 4370m-4370m-12 shall qualify as high priority projects under Executive Order 13766. Other projects or classes of projects subject to special environmental review and authorization streamlining processes, similar to those referenced in this subsection as may be determined by the FPISC Executive Director in consultation with OMB and CEQ, shall also qualify as high priority infrastructure projects under Executive Order 13766. The CEQ Chairman's responsibilities under sections 2 and 3 of Executive Order 13766 shall be satisfied by referring the project to the FPISC Executive Director, the Secretary of Transportation, or the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, as appropriate.\n(e) Council on Environmental Quality.\n(i) Directives. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the CEQ shall develop an initial list of actions it will take to enhance and modernize the Federal environmental review and authorization process. Such actions should include issuing such regulations, guidance, and directives as CEQ may deem necessary to:\n(A) ensure optimal interagency coordination of environmental review and authorization decisions, including by providing for an expanded role and authorities for lead agencies, more clearly defined responsibilities for cooperating and participating agencies, and Government-wide applicability of NEPA decisions and analyses;\n(B) ensure that environmental reviews and authorization decisions involving multiple agencies are conducted in a manner that is concurrent, synchronized, timely, and efficient;\n(C) provide for agency use, to the maximum extent permitted by law, of environmental studies, analysis, and decisions conducted in support of earlier Federal, State, tribal, or local environmental reviews or authorization decisions; and\n(D) ensure that agencies apply NEPA in a manner that reduces unnecessary burdens and delays as much as possible, including by using CEQ's authority to interpret NEPA to simplify and accelerate the NEPA review process.\n(ii) Dispute Resolution. Except where dispute resolution processes are otherwise provided for in law, including under 42 U.S.C. 4370m-2, or by Executive Order or other Presidential directive, upon request of a lead Federal agency, cooperating agency, or participating agency, CEQ may mediate interagency disputes arising between Federal agencies concerning Federal environmental review or authorization decisions for any infrastructure project pertaining to any environmental law, regulation, order or policy, and shall facilitate resolution of any conflicting positions of the relevant agencies. (iii) Agency Procedures. CEQ shall form and lead an interagency working group, consisting of the Director of OMB, agency CERPOs, and such other representatives of agencies as CEQ deems appropriate. The working group shall review the NEPA implementing regulations and other environmental review and authorization processing policies of agencies that are members of the FPISC to identify impediments to efficient and effective environmental reviews and authorizations for infrastructure projects. The working group shall also identify those agencies that require an action plan to address identified impediments. Based on this review, agencies shall develop action plans that set forth the actions they will take and timelines for completing those actions, and they shall submit those action plans to CEQ and OMB for comment. Each agency's action plan shall, at a minimum, establish procedures for a regular review and update of categorical exclusions, where appropriate.\n(f) Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council.\n(i) Organizational Support. Unless otherwise determined by the Director of OMB, the General Services Administration (GSA) shall provide necessary administrative and organizational support to the FPISC, including personnel, procurement, and budget support. The GSA Administrator, or the head of another agency designated by the Director of OMB, may delegate any authority to the FPISC Executive Director necessary for the operation and administration of the FPISC and the Office of the Executive Director, and the Executive Director may redelegate these authorities, as appropriate.\n(ii) Additional Duties. In addition to the duties and responsibilities charged to the FPISC Executive Director under 42 U.S.C. 4370m-4370m-12 and this order, the FPISC Executive Director may, upon request of a FPISC member agency or a project sponsor, work with the lead agency or any cooperating and participating agencies to facilitate the environmental review and authorization process for any infrastructure project regardless of whether the project is a \"covered project\" under 42 U.S.C. 4370m, including by resolving disputes and promoting early coordination. The FPISC Executive Director, the Director of OMB, or the Chairman of CEQ may establish any appropriate policies or procedures concerning the FPISC Executive Director's facilitation of the environmental review and authorization process under this subsection. Agencies must cooperate with the FPISC Executive Director with respect to the implementation of these additional duties.\n(g) Energy Corridors. The Departments of the Interior and Agriculture, as appropriate, shall be the lead agencies for facilitating the identification and designation of energy right-of-way corridors on Federal lands for Government-wide expedited environmental review for the development of energy infrastructure projects.\n(h) The Department of the Interior shall provide to OMB a strategy and recommendations for a multi-agency reorganization effort that would further the aims of this order. OMB, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, shall coordinate with the heads of other agencies affected to incorporate the strategy, as appropriate, into the comprehensive reorganization plan developed under Executive Order 13781 of March 13, 2017 (Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch).\nSec. 6. Executive Order 13690 of January 30, 2015 (Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input), is revoked.\nSec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J.

The two leaders celebrated the strong commercial ties, diplomatic engagement and regional security cooperation that define the positive bilateral relationship between the United States and Chile. Vice President Pence recognized Chile for its strong institutions and economic leadership that have served as an influential example throughout the region. The two leaders praised the US-Chile Free Trade Agreement, which has increased bilateral trade by more than 350% since it was signed in 2004, and Vice President Pence also indicated the need for additional improvements on intellectual property rights protection and regulatory transparency to further amplify its benefits. The Vice President highlighted Chile's participation in the Visa Waiver Program as an indication of the country's high standards, and thanked Chile for its active support for regional security initiatives, notably in Central America. Clearly stating US resolve to ensure a peaceful and denuclearized Korean Peninsula, Vice President Pence called on President Bachelet to consider taking additional diplomatic and economic steps to maintain pressure on the Kim regime. The two leaders also shared their deep, personal concern for the erosion of democracy and emerging humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. Vice President Pence thanked Chile for its public condemnation and diplomatic support, reiterating President Trump's commitment to work with regional and global partners to use all available diplomatic and economic tools to restore democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela.", "timestamp": "2017-08-16", "title": "Press Release - Readout of the Vice President's Meeting with President Michelle Bachelet of Chile"}
{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128006", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Tom, Guillermo Carey, Kathy Barclay, Minister Muсoz, Minister Rebolledo, Minister Cespedes, Minister Krauss, Ambassador Valdez, elected officials, distinguished members of the U.S. and Chilean business community, and honored guests.\nIt is my great honor to be with you today in Santiago to celebrate 50 years of the Association of American Chambers of Commerce in Latin America and 100 years of the American Chamber in Chile. (Applause.)\nIt is such an honor to be here in this historic year, and I bring greetings and congratulations on this milestone from a champion of a stronger economic partnership between the United States and Latin America, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States will always put the security and prosperity of America first. But I hope as my presence here today demonstrates, America First does not mean America alone.\nThe President personally sent me here to Chile, to \"el fin de terra\" -- (applause) -- because the United States seeks to draw this nation and all the free nations of Latin America ever closer to ourselves in friendship and in commerce -- so that we may partner together, profit together, and prosper together like never before in this great hemisphere of freedom.\nIt's a truth borne out by history that Latin America's prosperity directly impacts the prosperity of the United States. And the American Chamber of Commerce will continue to be essential to our shared prosperity in the years ahead, and we're building on a strong foundation that all of you here helped to build.\nIn this year of celebration, let me just say thank you. Let me just say that AmCham has done an extraordinary job building the relationship between our two nations. Ever since its founding, AmCham Chile has brought together American and Chilean businesses to foster investment and opportunity in both our nations. Today you boast more than 550 members and employ more than 430,000 people in those enterprises.\nAnd the Association of American Chambers represents more than 20,000 companies that operate in essentially every corner of Central America, South America, and the Caribbean.\nIn fact, your members account for more than 80 percent of U.S. investment in these regions, and every day, you bring Latin America closer to the United States of America. So why don't you give yourselves a round of applause on a job well done? (Applause.)\nThanks in large part to the companies represented here, and to the dedicated work of the AmCham team, trade between the United States and Latin America is soaring.\nThe United States is the largest trading partner for nearly two-thirds of the hemisphere. And last year, our two-way trade in the Western Hemisphere totaled a stunning $1.6 trillion.\nWe trade twice as much with the countries of our hemisphere as we do with China. And we export more to the Americas than we do to all of Asia combined.\nToday, more than two of every five dollars in American exports comes to this region, supporting nearly 4 million, good-paying jobs in the United States. And companies across America have invested nearly $850 billion in Latin America.\nSo let me assure you: Under President Donald Trump, the United States of America wants to trade even more with Latin America. We want to invest even more in Latin America. We want to bring even more of our business culture of entrepreneurship and innovation all across Latin America so that your prosperity and our prosperity will continue to expand together. (Applause.)\nI am here tonight because the United States sees tremendous promise and tremendous potential, as well, in Latin America.\nIn all of our interactions with Latin American leaders, almost without exception, the President and I have made clear we want to see their nations continue to take decisive steps to unleash their economies and empower their citizens because these actions will inaugurate we believe a gold rush of growth just like they already are all across this region.\nSimply look at what President Trump has accomplished in our country since he took office just over seven short months ago.\nIn America, our administration has been rolling back excessive regulation, unleashing American energy, laying the groundwork for historic tax relief -- all of which has already renewed American confidence, spurred the creation of more than 1 million new jobs this year alone, and seen the wealth of Americans on our stock market rise by trillions of dollars.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the American economy is back, and we're just getting started. (Applause.)\nAnd when it comes to international trade, President Trump has been fighting to break down barriers to American exports and create a level playing field for American workers.\nPresident Trump has made it clear that the United States seeks trade that is both free and fair. And as we speak, our administration is reviewing our existing trade agreements and exploring new bilateral agreements.\nIn many ways, the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement is a model agreement. Signed in 2003, this agreement eliminated tariffs and expanded market access, while creating new protections for intellectual property and increasing regulatory transparency. And the result has been a dramatic expansion of trade, investment, and opportunity for the people of the United States and of Chile.\nTrade between our countries since the signing of that agreement has spiked by more than 350 percent in the last 13 years. Today, our two-way trade in goods and services totaled nearly $30 billion, with a $4.1 billion goods surplus for the United States.\nAnd the United States has been Chile's largest source of foreign direct investment for years, while Chileans have invested $2.1 billion in our country in industries -- mining, forestry, banking, and all across our economy. Today, our exports to Chile support an estimated 93,000 jobs in the United States.\nBefore I go further: Thank you to all of you who are here tonight who have made this agreement work. You've brought this framework to life. You've created jobs and wealth for the people of the United States and the people of Chile. And you have our thanks. (Applause.)\nAs we celebrate this important agreement, it's important still that we ensure that we live up to the promises that we've made to one another in terms in full.\nAs I discussed today with President Bachelet, it would be important for Chile to comply with the intellectual property rights chapter of our free-trade agreement, to ensure a fair and level playing field for U.S. companies. Specifically, we spoke of the need to have Chile make television piracy a criminal offense and apply regulatory policies in a transparent manner. And I'm grateful for the President's openness to considering just those measures.\nBeyond Chile, the United States has free-trade agreements with 11 other countries in the Western Hemisphere. And just today, the United States, Mexico, and Canada officially began to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nWhat we do with NAFTA will be emblematic of how we deal with trade across the wider region. In fact, our prioritization of NAFTA indicates the importance of our hemisphere to this administration.\nIn the more than 20 years since it was first negotiated, NAFTA has frankly fallen behind the times, and too often U.S. workers have paid the price.\nAs we begin this renegotiation, you may be assured the United States will work with our allies to the north and the south to update these provisions in line with the original spirit of NAFTA. And both Canada and Mexico already agree that NAFTA has significant room for improvement to ensure a truly level playing field.\nAs I told Prime Minister Trudeau last month, we will work together, and we will achieve a renegotiation of NAFTA that will be a win-win-win outcome in this hemisphere. And I'm confident under President Trump's leadership, we'll modernize NAFTA and bring it into the 21st century.\nBut trade is only one part of the equation. To deliver on the aspirations of the people of Latin America, we believe its leaders must continue to enact market-based reforms that will create strong and growing economies on an increasing basis.\nHistory attests that economic freedom is the foundation for prosperity, and we need look no further than Chile for proof of that.\nFour decades ago, Chile embraced free-market principles --implementing tax reform, tackling regulations, breaking down trade barriers, and confronting corruption head-on even as you strengthened the rule of law. And Chile created an open and integrated economy the likes of which Latin America had never seen in its time.\nAnd Chile has reaped the rewards ever since. Growth has averaged more than 5 percent for more than 30 years. Millions have risen out of poverty in your country. Living standards have soared across the board for Chilean people. And a free economy has ultimately led Chile to a free society, and a vibrant democracy is flourishing and is a hallmark of your success. (Applause.)\nSo let me take this opportunity simply to congratulate President Bachelet, all the leaders of all the political parties of this country, and the people of Chile for your example to the world advancing economic and political freedom in our hemisphere.\nAnd today, countries around Latin America are following in Chile's footsteps, and it's remarkable to watch. Yesterday, I was in Argentina, where President Macri is pursuing a bold agenda of reform and revitalization in the economy of his country.\nTwo days ago, I was in Colombia, where President Santos is working to bring economic reform and opportunity to areas where poverty and crime have long reigned.\nIn Brazil, labor, pension, and fiscal reforms are turning the country toward greater economic freedom, integration, and competitiveness.\nFurther north in Central America, the three nations of the Northern Triangle have committed to improve their economic climates with sweeping reforms in taxes and regulation.\nWe are literally witnessing the unfolding of a new era of economic growth in this New World, and President Trump and I are grateful for the commitment to economic freedom that is spreading across this hemisphere.\nBut today, like you might expect from your neighbor to the north, we're calling on countries across Latin America for all that you have done to do more -- to do much more to expand opportunities for investment through economic freedom across this region.\nEvery nation in our hemisphere must continue be bold -- bold in reducing the burden of excessive taxation, reducing regulation; bold in breaking down barriers to trade and investment. And yes, every nation in Latin America must continue to be bold in confronting the scourge of corruption.\nThe government of the United States and our business community will strongly support Latin America as you advance judicial reforms and you strengthen the rule of law in countries across this region.\nAmerican companies, as you know, bring a culture of compliance and transparency that perhaps is maybe their greatest legacy in Latin America. But all of us want to see even more actions from the region's governments to ensure the long-term stability of investments.\nMake no mistake about it, more progress, more reform, more transparency will earn more investment and more opportunities all across Latin America. This very gathering is a testament to the extraordinary optimism of U.S. companies in the region. You see an opening for untold progress, and obviously you're ready, willing, and able to seize it.\nAs we speak, U.S. firms are growing existing investments and preparing new ones in countries all across our hemisphere. Thanks to Chile's strong support for the rule of law, major companies like Abbot Laboratories, Metlife, and others have already invested billions of dollars here over the years.\nAnd in countries like Argentina, Colombia, and in the Northern Triangle of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, U.S. firms are making significant investments and commitments, inspired by the progress that's underway supporting good-paying jobs back in the United States.\nThere's no limit to what we can achieve if the nations of Latin America embrace this opportunity with renewed vigor. And I have confidence and President Trump has confidence that you will.\nAnd Latin America's progress will mean more jobs and growth in the United States of America. We're growing together, and we will grow even more.\nA secure Latin America means a more secure United States of America. A prosperous Latin America means a more prosperous United States of America. And make no mistake about it, President and I hold the view that the advance of freedom in Latin America benefits the cause of freedom everywhere because when free peoples stand together, there's nothing and no limit to what we can accomplish.\nIt is truly remarkable to think how far so much of Latin America has come in the last several decades. But as we continue to walk this path to economic and political freedom together, the sad truth is that not all of our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere walk with us.\nTo the north, in Venezuela, the tragedy of tyranny is playing out before our eyes. As President Trump has said, in his words, the Venezuelan people are suffering, the Venezuelan people are dying.\nI saw firsthand just a few days ago Venezuelan people experiencing the grinding poverty that's being wrought by the Maduro regime. I met with refugees in Colombia who had fled their own home country with their families. They told me of how families cannot find the food and medicine that they need to survive, and how innocent children are literally perishing every day from deprivation and hunger.\nToday, the once-free people of Venezuela are being forced to endure this fate by the brutality of the Maduro regime. Venezuela is sliding into dictatorship, and as President Donald Trump has said \"the United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\" (Applause.)\nWe will continue to stand with free nations across our hemisphere until democracy is restored for the Venezuelan people.\nLet me take this opportunity to praise Chile and all the other free nations in our hemisphere who have spoken out with one voice to condemn the actions of the Maduro regime. Their actions and the words they've expressed have been an inspiration to the wider world.\nAnd for our part, The United States will continue to bring the full measure of American economic and diplomatic power to bear until democracy in Venezuela is restored.\nAs President Trump said just a few days ago, \"we have many options for Venezuela.\" But the President and I truly believe that working with all our allies across Latin America, that we can achieve a peaceable solution to the crisis facing the Venezuelan people. But we much achieve that goal together. (Applause.)\nAnd be assured what we do, we will do together. We do this because it's right. The Venezuelan people deserve freedom. And we do this because, as President Trump has said, a \"stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of the entire hemisphere.\"\nThe truth we all know is a failed state knows no boundaries. A failed state in Venezuela will drive more illegal drug trafficking with its murderous criminal consequences radiating outward and destroying families in your countries and in ours. A failed state in Venezuela will drive more illegal migration, compromising our borders and burdening our economies. And ultimately, a failed state in Venezuela will endanger the security, prosperity, and well-being of all who call our Western Hemisphere home.\nMy friends, we all live in the same neighborhood. We succeed when our neighbors succeed. We struggle when our neighbors struggle. And so we will continue to act together to support the people of Venezuela until freedom once again dawns in that nation. (Applause.)\nFreedom always has been and always will be the surest pathway to prosperity. The people of Chile know that. The continued embrace of liberty across Latin America will propel us even further down this path of progress that we find ourselves on.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States will work without ceasing to strengthen our bonds of friendship and commerce with the nations of Latin America. We'll stand with all the free peoples of these great countries as they and their leaders take action to unleash their full potential.\nWe are building on a strong foundation, established in no small part by the actions of AmCham and all those gathered here. And together I believe we will reach new heights of prosperity and opportunity in this still new century, and the world will once again marvel at the New World.\nAnd I'm confident. I have faith. I have faith in the free enterprise and in the political freedom and shared values that bring us together here tonight. I have faith in the good people of this hemisphere, in their reliance and determination and aspirations. I have faith in President Trump's vision for a hemisphere growing together. And lastly, I have faith in Him who has ever guided our forbearers when they first found this New World, faced hardships and trials, and carved out a vision for liberty. And by His grace, I know the best days for the United States of America, the best days for Latin America, and the best days for this New World are yet to come.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless you for all your success and may God bless the United States of America.

Mr. Vice President of the United States of America, Mr. Michael Richard Pence, and distinguished delegation, Mr. Foreign Minister Heraldo Muсoz, representatives of the diplomatic corps of the U.S., and dear friends, today, we received the Vice President of the United States, Michael Pence, in our country, and his visit is an example of the strength of our ties. It's an expression of interest of working with Chile in a broad agenda -- regional, multilateral, and national issues.\nThe relationship with the United States is strategic -- politically and economically. We share views on democracy, human rights, and opening of markets. And today, we've approached different issues of interest. Among them, the program related to visa waiver U.S. And Chile the only country of Latin America -- of the 38 states -- beneficiary of the program. And this has involved that. After three years of coming into force, more than 400,000 tourists of Chile have gone to the United States.\nWith the Vice President, Mike Pence, we have discussed our sound trade and economic relationship within the FTA, as subscribed by both countries. And this agreement has more than one decade. One hundred percent of the products is tariff-free. Likewise, the agreement provides access to services guaranteeing intellectual property rights and incentivizes investments of the U.S. in different sectors of our economy.\nIn addition to that, we discusses our very fruitful political relationship, underlining our ties, not only federally and with different states. In areas like energy, science, technology, and renewable energies, we are discussing with (inaudible) and researchers. And also, we have reaffirmed our interest and commitment to work jointly with countries of the Northern Triangle of Central America and Haiti in order to cooperate for institutional strengthening and governance.\nLikewise, we have spoken about the peace process of Colombia, a country that has received Vice President Pence. Chile has been fully committed to support Colombia in all of its projects to create peace and well-being for its citizens.\nAnd also, in Latin America, allow me to refer to Venezuela -- something that we have also discussed. Chile, like 11 countries of the region, subscribed the Declaration of Lima a week ago, and this explains our ways to contribute to restore democracy in Venezuela through a peaceful and negotiated way out. There is high concern for the levels of violence and humanitarian crises experienced by Venezuela, generating a tremendous wave of migration to neighboring countries. Chile will do its utmost to support Venezuela to find a peaceful way out. But Chile will not support military interventions, nor coup d'йtat. As to sanctions, we'll support all those adopted by the Security Council of the U.N.\nAs to sensitive issues, Chile has expressed in the General Assembly, Security Council, and OAS, its concern for the nuclear weapons program of Northern Korea. It calls to renew all the diplomatic efforts and conversations -- tripartite -- to the North, South Korea, China, the Russian Federation -- in order to have nuclear Korea -- rather, a Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.\nAnd also, in our energy and climate partnership of the Americas, ECPA, that will be held in Chile in September next. And Chile will be the venue of the next meeting of APEC 2019. And on that occasion, we hope to have all the collaboration of the United States.\nThank you very much.\nNow we invite and recognize His Excellency, Vice President of the United States of America, Mr. Michael Pence.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: President Bachelet, thank you for your words and for your warm hospitality that you have shown to me and my wife on our very first visit to Chile. It's a great honor to join you here at the historic La Moneda Palace. So thank you again.\nI'm here today on behalf of the President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump, to reaffirm to you and the people of Chile the strategic partnership and valued friendship between the United States and Chile.\nMadam President, Chile is a beacon of freedom in the Western Hemisphere, and the United States of America is proud to call you our partner in prosperity and security, and we are proud to call Chile our friend.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States will always put the security and prosperity of America first. But as I hope my presence today demonstrates, America First does not mean America alone.\nAs President Bachelet and I discussed today, the security and prosperity of our two countries are deeply intertwined and have been so for generations.\nJust over four decades ago, Chile reoriented its economy on a free-market foundation. The result was nothing short of extraordinary -- \"The Miracle of Chile.\"\nMillions rose out of poverty. Living standards soared for the Chilean people, and Chile's embrace of free markets ultimately gave rise to a free society overall. And today Chile is a flourishing democracy with a flourishing free-market economy.\nChile's continued success is inspiring. And, Madam President, your country's excellent example has moved your neighbors across Latin America to enact their own market-based reforms to spur growth and generate prosperity for their citizens. Your example shines for all in the Western Hemisphere to see. And it's an honor to be with you today.\nAnd Chile's embrace of freedom has brought this country into a closer relationship with the United States. In fact, Chile is the only Latin American nation to participate in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, a sign of the high standards that define Chile today.\nMadam President, as we discussed, under your leadership and that of President Trump, we will continue to strengthen the bonds between our nations, especially in terms of commerce.\nToday, our two-way trade in goods and services totals nearly $30 billion, with a $4.1 billion surplus for the United States, and the United States has been Chile's largest source of foreign direct investment for years, while Chileans have invested $414 million in our country in recent years -- in mining, forestry, banking. And U.S. exports to Chile support some 93,000 jobs in the United States.\nThis is a remarkable story of success, and it stems in large part from our free trade agreement that you just mentioned, signed in 2003. It's caused trade between the United States and Chile to soar by more than 350 percent.\nIn many ways, the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement is a model of a mutually beneficial agreement between two nations. But as I discussed today with President Bachelet, we believe it would be important for Chile to take steps to comply with the agreement's intellectual property rights chapter to ensure a fair and level playing field for U.S. companies. We also believe such actions will bring renewed economic benefits to both our countries.\nNow, tonight, I will address two institutions that epitomize the deep and longstanding commercial ties connecting our two nations -- the American Chamber of Commerce in Chile, which is kicking off its centennial celebration this year, and the Association of American Chambers of Latin America, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary. There, I'll speak to businesses that are already and are ready to invest even more in Chile and across the wider region.\nBut as Chile well knows, security is the foundation of our prosperity, and, Madam President, you know that the United States is truly grateful -- truly grateful for Chile's leadership in promoting regional security in partnership with our country.\nToday I thanked your President for her strong leadership and consistent statements about the provocative behavior by the regime in North Korea. The United States is grateful for Chile's support to promote peace and stability and a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\nAs President Trump has made clear, the era of strategic patience is over. With regard to North Korea, all options are on the table, and the United States will continue to bring the full range of American power -- economic and diplomatic -- until North Korea abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nWith the strong leadership of President Donald Trump, our administration has been marshalling the support of nations around the world, and as the President acknowledged this morning, we are beginning to see progress in dealing with North Korea's provocations and pursuit of a nuclear and ballistic missile program.\nBut more must still be done, much more.\nAs President Bachelet and I discussed today, the United States places great importance on the ongoing diplomatic isolation of the Kim regime. And we strongly urge Chile today, and we urge Brazil, Mexico, and Peru to break all diplomatic and commercial ties to North Korea.\nWe would especially welcome Chile reclassifying exports of Chilean wine, as the President and I discussed -- reclassifying the wine as a luxury good under current U.S. [sic] sanctions to prevent North Korea from obtaining these commodities and converting them into hard currency that support the regime.\nCloser to home, here in our hemisphere, there is another rogue regime. And a tragedy of tyranny is playing out before our eyes in Venezuela.\nAs President Trump has said, in his words, the Venezuelan people \"are suffering and they are dying.\"\nI saw firsthand talking with refugees during my visit to Colombia, refugees from Venezuela. I heard about the grinding poverty, how families cannot find the food and medicine they need to survive, how innocent children are literally perishing every day from starvation and deprivation.\nLet me be clear: The once-free people of Venezuela are being forced to endure that fate by the brutality of the Maduro regime.\nVenezuela is sliding into dictatorship, and as President Trump has said \"the United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\"\nPresident Trump has said that a stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of our entire hemisphere. And, Madam President, I know that you agree with that strongly. Be assured that we will continue to stand with free nations across our hemisphere until democracy is restored for the Venezuelan people.\nMadam President, President Trump and I are grateful for Chile's leadership in condemning the Maduro regime, and we recognize Chile and 11 other countries for signing the Lima Declaration just last week, sending a powerful message that the free peoples of the Americas will stand with the Venezuelan people and stand up to their oppressors.\nBut President Trump and I call on Latin America to do more. And know this: The United States will continue to bring the full measure of our economic and diplomatic power to bear until democracy is restored in Venezuela.\nAs President Trump has said just a few days ago, the United States has \"many options for Venezuela.\" But the President also remains confident that working with all our allies across Latin America we can achieve a peaceable solution to the crisis facing the Venezuelan people.\nMadam President, as I assured you today in our meeting, I assure you now: What we do for Venezuela, we will do together.\nWe all live in the same neighborhood. We succeed when our neighbors succeed. We struggle when our neighbors struggle, and so we will continue to act, together, to support the people of Venezuela in their fight for freedom. And I believe with all of my heart, the Venezuelan people will be free once more and their democracy restored.\nThe people of the United States and the people of Chile know that freedom is the source of our prosperity and security. And, Madam President, I am confident that Chile will continue to be a model of freedom that shines throughout the Western Hemisphere and the wider world.\nAnd know that the United States cherishes our friendship with the Chilean people. And even now, our bond is growing, and our security and prosperity are advancing hand-in-hand. And I have faith that together, the United States and Chile will continue to achieve great progress for our people and our hemisphere.\nSo, President Bachelet, I thank you again for your hospitality. It is an honor to be with you today, and I look forward to our continued discussions.\n(Applause.)\nPRESIDENT BACHELET: (As interpreted.) I'm going to leave you know for a couple of moments -- and we will meet again -- so you can speak to your press.\nThank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you.\nLouise Radnofsky.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Would you come again? I'm sorry. Thank you.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, on North Korea, do you believe that other countries including China should take the same steps as the Latin American countries that you urged to do so today?\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: President Trump sent me to the Asian Pacific earlier this year, and he sent other representatives of our administration to send one clear message to North Korea, and that is that the era of strategic patience is over.\nLiterally for decades, the world community has practiced a patience with North Korea in the hopes that they would someday abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile ambitions. And all along the way, North Korea has simply used delay and used feigned negotiations to continue to -- in their headlong rush to obtain usable nuclear weapons and a ballistic missile program.\nAnd the President has made it clear that those days are over. We truly believe that it's imperative that the regime in Pyongyang understand that all options are on the table. The United States of America will simply not permit a rogue regime in North Korea to possess usable nuclear weapons that can reach the continental United States and threaten our people.\nBut that being said, we believe that the ongoing economic and diplomatic pressure that's being brought to bear by our allies in the region, by allies here in Latin America, and renewed pressure by China itself is resulting in what we believe represent glimmers of hope that we can achieve by peaceful means that which nations around the world have sought on the Korean Peninsula now for decades.\nMy call today here in Chile and our efforts with regard to Brazil, Mexico, and Peru is simply to call on our friends in this hemisphere and call on nations around the world to continue to use the economic and diplomatic tools that they have to further isolate North Korea.\nWe truly do believe that we are seeing progress, which I mentioned the President acknowledged this morning. But more needs to be done, and it is our hope that Chile, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru will join us in breaking all diplomatic and commercial ties with North Korea. And as that isolation -- economically and diplomatically -- continues, the hope for a peaceable solution and a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula we believe becomes more attainable.\nQ: Just to be clear, by cutting diplomatic ties, do you mean that there shouldn't be embassies within North Korea or ambassadors to North Korea? And are you concerned that given that the threat to Guam was withdrawn, essentially yesterday, your comments today could ratchet the situation up again?\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: The policy of the United States is that we are working with nations around the world to isolate North Korea economically and diplomatically. At present, Chile essentially has -- if I describe it correctly, they essentially have a joint arrangement of their diplomatic relations with China and with North Korea. But to the credit of Chile, they have not presented credentials for the last four years, and I requested President Bachelet today simply to terminate that relationship formally.\nWe believe that that will facilitate a peaceable outcome. We want North Korea to understand there is a cost among the family of nations to their ongoing provocations. As the President did today, we welcome the statements of the Kim regime this week with regard to Guam. But our objective is clear: It is a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. We want the regime in Pyongyang to permanently abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and ambitions. And we'll continue to bring pressure to bear till we achieve that goal.\nPhil.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, we appreciate you taking a couple questions, sir. Thank you.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Sure.\nQ: The remarks made by President Trump yesterday about the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia alarmed many Americans, including Republican supporters. Do you agree with the President that there were good people among the white supremacist protesters and that there was blame to be had on both sides? And more broadly, sir, do you believe that Confederate statues should be removed as is happening in many cities across the South? Or do you agree with the President that the Confederate General Robert E. Lee should be considered in the same pantheon as George Washington?\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: What happened in Charlottesville was a tragedy, and the President has been clear on this tragedy and so have I. I spoke at length about this heart-breaking situation on Sunday night in Colombia, and I stand with the President, and I stand by those words.\nBut today while I'm here in Chile, our hearts are in Charlottesville because just a few short hours ago, family and friends gathered to say farewell to a remarkable young woman, Heather Heyer. And we've been praying. We've been praying for God's peace and comfort for her family and her friends and her loved ones.\nAnd we're also praying that in America that we will not allow the few to divide the many. The strength of the United States of America is always strongest, as the President has said so eloquently, when we are united around our shared values, and so it will always be.\nBut let me say it's about the strength of the United States of America that the President sent me here to Latin America. And as we prepared to end our trip a little bit early tomorrow, after we stop in Panama, I leave here greatly encouraged that across South America and Central America and with the United States and Canada, that there is -- this is a new era here in the New World. Chile is a shining example of a nation that first chose economic freedom decades ago, and now is experiencing a vibrant, democracy. And it's inspiring nations across Latin America who have followed Chile's lead.\nAnd I return from this trip more encouraged than ever that not only will our commerce grow -- strengthening jobs and opportunities in America; strengthening the prosperity across Latin America; but I truly do believe that the unity that I have experienced in our determination to ensure that we will not permit a failed state in Venezuela in this hemisphere is more true than ever.\nThe determination, Phil, that I have heard among the nations that I visited about ensuring that we stand with the Venezuelan people, that we bring the full measure of economic and diplomatic power to bear until democracy is restored has truly been inspiring.\nI've made it clear that -- as the President has, that the United States of America has many options. We reserve those options to advance the security of the United States with regard to Venezuela. But I will return home tomorrow more confident than ever that freedom-loving countries across Latin America, along with the United States can continue bring pressure to bear; the kind of pressure that President Bachelet and I discussed today in increasing measure onto Venezuela and create the kind of conditions where we see democracy restored.\nPhil, thank you very much.\nThank you, all.", "timestamp": "2017-08-16", "title": "The Vice President's News Conference with President Michelle Bachelet of Chile in Santiago, Chile"}

I would like to begin by energetically condemning the terrorist act that occurred today in Barcelona. We share the pain of the people and of the Spanish government. And we raise our prayers to the victims and their family members.\nVice President Pence, on behalf of the people and government of the Republic of Panama, I would like to welcome you most cordially to our country as Vice President of the United States of America, Michael Pence, and his wife, Karen.\nWe are delighted that you've had the opportunity to visit our canal, a work which is the reflection of over a hundred years of friendship and cooperation between Panama and the United States, and which contributes to the strengthening of international trade.\nThis meeting has allowed us to share our vision on the opportunities and -- the opportunities that we can take advantage of and enjoy together on the basis of our excellent diplomatic relations that are consolidated here today.\nYou, sir, are a man of faith. And men of faith in public life always strive for the common good. That's why I am certain that this exchange that we have had will have an impact on the quality of life of many human beings throughout the region.\nI take the opportunity to thank Vice President Pence for the attention -- or for the hosting in the United States, of the United States government and people during our visit to President Trump in June of this year.\nDuring our talks, we clearly established that Panama is an ally and strategic partner to the United States. We have a stable democracy with strong indicators of growth and economic stability; a police, which moves forward in transparency and accountability in the state, as well as in our financial system.\nI have said to Vice President Pence that we have an enormous interest in having more American companies invest in our country and participate in infrastructure projects that we are currently developing.\nPanama has become the great connection for world trade with our logistic system -- the widened Panama Canal, the development of ports, the expansion of the Tocumen Airport and the master plan of the Interoceanic Plan which will turn our logistics hub into a world-class hub.\nThe participation of the United States and the development of the logistics and maritime sectors will be of mutual benefit because aside from adding value to the inter-oceanic route, it will allow American companies which use the Panama Canal to obtain better profits from this route.\nWe thank the United States for your cooperation in the exchange of information and best practices, which allow us to protect the financial and logistic system of our country. It is our duty to protect the financial center and Panama's logistics platform so that it may not be used for illegal activities or for purposes that do not go to the common good.\nThis has been a priority for me since I began my public service. The commitment of our country to financial transparency and the security of the logistics and services platform in Panama is stronger by the day. The path we have chosen shall not be reverted.\nSecurity is one of the fundamental issues that affects our region. We have identified the challenges that we face, such as the increase in the production and trafficking in drugs, illegal migration, and the situation of the Northern Triangle, and the situation in Venezuela.\nWe have agreed on the risk that the increase in drug production in neighboring countries represents for the region, and we are determined to defeat that with the support of allies like the United States.\nWe thank the government of the United States of America for their cooperation to improve the installed capabilities of our security agencies. Panama is among the countries of the region that seizes most drugs per year. We are making a huge effort to ensure security along the border with Colombia by increasing governmental presence in the border province of Darien. But it is also necessary to strengthen intelligence sharing and the sharing of databases of those people who represent a threat.\nIt is alarming how organized crime, together with drug trafficking, makes the security situation in the region worse, causing death and greater poverty.\nIn my meeting with President Donald Trump in mid-June of this year I stressed my concern over the increase in drug production, which is a subject that you, too, have addressed during your visit to the region.\nOur country is playing an important role in irregular migration, and we are protecting our borders to keep the safe and detecting irregular migrants to who represent a risk to the United States, to the Americas, and to the rest of the countries in the world.\nIt is important to maintain cooperation between governments, as we did to face the Haitian and Cuban migrant crisis last year; the basis of which we created an integrated border security system.\nWe very specifically analyze the political conflict in Venezuela. We are concerned about stability in that country and the breaking of the democratic order and the consequences that that may provoke.\nOver the next few days, Panama will take measures which support the return of democratic order in Venezuela and strengthen our internal security together with migratory measures, always within the framework of respecting human rights of migrants.\nThe Panamanian government reiterates its position that the government of President Nicolas Madura must respect the separation of powers, human rights, freedoms, and the urgency to negotiate a political solution in the framework of the current constitution of Venezuela for the benefit of its population.\nWe share the concern for the interruption of the democratic and constitutional order by the authorities in Venezuela. Panama is a country that builds bridges. Therefore we maintain our position to help with a specific solution as a result of a joint effort throughout the hemisphere to contribute to a solution for the humanitarian political crisis in that neighboring brother country and its people. For this we have joined the Lima Consensus, which maintains as a priority the defense of democracy on the American continent, trying to return to democratic order, and lessening violence in the Venezuelan people.\nWe must strengthen political dialogue between nations in order to keep peace on our continent in the face of threats in the continent and in countries like North Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq and others.\nIn the face of the situation that we face in the countries of the Northern Triangle in Central America, we agree that the strengthening of institutionality, democracy, and honesty of men in public life is the key to social peace.\nPanama is a regional ally willing to join capacities to contribute to peace and prosperity in our region on the basis of democratic values and transparency that we all share.\nI wish Vice President Pence a good trip home, and I would ask him to take the message to President Trump and to the American people that Panama values in a very special way the ties with the United States that this relationship is based on as a result of our long history, trust, and mutual respect guided by a main interest of generating well-being for our peoples.\nAs our country's coat of arms say -- Pro Mundi Beneficio is our motto and guides our foreign policy and our relationship with all countries in the world. Panama is a country at the service of the world.\nMany thanks for your visit, Mr. Vice President.\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you, President Varela. It's an honor to be with you today.\nBefore I begin, allow me to take a moment to again address the horrific terror attack today in Barcelona, Spain.\nThis is a tragic day, and the latest scenes of carnage and mayhem sicken us all. As President Trump said earlier today, \"The United States condemns this terror attack… and we will do whatever is necessary to help.\" The people of Barcelona should know: Our prayers and the prayers of all the American people are with the victims, their families, and all the good people of Spain.\nThis latest attack, the worst terror attack on Spanish soil since the 2004 Madrid train bombings, shows us again that radical Islamic terrorism is one of the greatest threats that we face today.\nISIS has taken credit for this barbaric attack, but whoever is responsible should know that the United States of America, together with our allies, will find and punish those responsible and drive the evil of radical Islamic terror from the face of the Earth.\nAs I told you, President Varela, President Trump and I are truly grateful for Panama's participation in our global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. Today, Panama is the only Latin American country in our coalition, and we call on all of our partners across Latin America to follow Panama's example of leadership and join this global coalition.\nMr. President, we're grateful for your commitment to this cause, for your partnership, and for the warm hospitality that you've shown me and my wife on our first visit to Panama.\nIt was an honor, along with President Donald Trump, to welcome you to the White House just two months ago, and now it's my great honor to be welcomed by you and Vice President St. Malo to Panama and the beautiful Palacio de las Garzas.\nThis is the final stop on my first trip to Latin America, and I'm here, on President Trump's behalf to reaffirm the historic friendship between the United States and Panama and to commit to strengthening our partnership in security and prosperity for the continued benefit of our people, our nations, and the hemisphere that we call home.\nMr. President, we are with you. The United States of America stands with Panama as we pursue a brighter future together.\nNearly 114 years ago, the United States was the first country in the world to recognize Panama as an independent nation. And just as we stood with Panama then, we continue to stand with Panama today as partners in commerce, security, and liberty.\nEarlier today, I visited the Panama Canal, which represents not only a path between the seas, but the enduring strength of the bond between the United States and Panama. Together, we built the canal with American ingenuity, Panamanian grit, and a lot of Pittsburgh steel.\nAnd, Mr. President, let me thank you and the people of Panama for your stewardship of the Panama Canal over the past two decades. Your more than $5 billion investment in the canal's expansion completed just last year was truly historic. And it proves once again that the prosperity of both our nations is deeply intertwined and connected to that passageway.\nThe completion of the canal expansion has resulted in billions of dollars of investment in the United States, creating good-paying jobs in manufacturing, transportation, and agriculture already.\nAnd ports across America are growing to accommodate the new Neopanamax ships in Savannah, Charleston, and many more places. In fact, the Port of Miami just completed a $2 billion expansion.\nLet me also commend you, Mr. President, and the people of Panama for your continued embrace of free-market policies. The reforms you've unleashed have created remarkable growth over the past decade. And your personal commitment to this day I believe is inspiring countries across Latin America to follow Panama's example.\nFor our part, the United States is proud to partner in Panama's growth because your prosperity continues to contribute to our own.\nSince 2012, the U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement has lowered trade barriers, opened up new opportunities for investment, to the great benefit of both of our nations.\nAs you know, Mr. President, that trade promotion authority has provided Panamanian exporters direct access to U.S. markets, pushing the total goods trade between our two countries to $6.5 billion last year. And American businesses have invested $4.1 billion in Panama, creating jobs and opportunities for both of our nations.\nMr. President, I'm confident that with your leadership in Panama, and President Trump's leadership in the United States, we will build on this foundation of success and achieve even greater prosperity in the future.\nThe same is true with security, which is the foundation of our prosperity and a key pillar of the strategic partnership between the United States and Panama.\nI've already spoken about Panama's leadership and partnership with the United States in the fight against radical Islamic terror, but Panama's leadership is also evident in your strong cooperation with the United States on border security.\nAt Tocumen International Airport, the United States has been proud to help Panamanian authorities screen over 15 million passenger records per year against U.S. databases.\nAnd we have provided Panama with a state-of-the-art border management system that includes a biometrics-capture program called BITMAP for undocumented and high-threat travelers that Panama has put to good use.\nUsing this program, under your leadership, Panama has captured and shared a substantial number of records -- more than the rest of the world combined.\nAnd, Mr. President, as we discussed today, Panama is on the front line in the fight to eliminate the flow of illegal drugs and dismantle transnational drug trafficking organizations here in the Western Hemisphere.\nThe drug trade is the cause of so much of the violence, crime, and corruption that threatens the future of your people and ours. And in the United States, the flow of illegal drugs has poisoned our children, torn apart families, and devastated too many communities.\nThis threat faces us both. And together, we will continue to confront it, and overcome it.\nPanama has already proven itself an invaluable partner. With strong U.S. support, last year Panama's security forces seized more than 56 metric tons of cocaine, more than the rest of Central America combined. And Mr. President, we are truly grateful for your personal commitment to this fight against illicit drugs.\nMr. President, in prosperity and security, Panama is leading Latin America toward a brighter future.\nBut while our two nations and so many others embrace the promise and progress of freedom, one of our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere is retreating to the darkness of the past. And you just spoke of them in your remarks.\nAs President Trump has said, in his words, the Venezuelan people are \"suffering and they are dying.\" They are experiencing, as I saw firsthand when I met with Venezuelan refugees in my visit to Colombia early this week, families are experiencing grinding poverty, unable find the food and medicine they need to survive, and innocent children are literally perishing every day from hunger and deprivation.\nThe once-free people of Venezuela are being forced to endure that fate by the brutality of the Maduro regime.\nVenezuela is sliding into dictatorship, and as President Donald Trump told you in your meeting and has declared publicly, \"the United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\"\nAnd you can be assured, Mr. President, we will continue to stand with Panama and with free nations across this hemisphere until democracy is restored for the Venezuelan people.\nMr. President, let me thank you once again for Panama's strong call for restoration of democracy in Venezuela.\nWe particularly appreciate Panama for joining 11 other countries just last week to sign the Lima Declaration, which sent a powerful message that the free peoples of the Americas will stand with the Venezuelan people and stand up to their oppressors.\nBut President Trump and I call on Latin America to do more. And know this: The United States will continue to bring the full measure of American economic and diplomatic power to bear until democracy is restored in Venezuela.\nAs President Trump has made clear, \"We have many options for Venezuela.\" But the President and I also remain confident that working with you and all our allies across Latin America, we will be able to achieve a peaceable solution to the crisis facing the Venezuelan people.\nMr. President, I can assure you as well that what we do for Venezuela, we will do together.\nBecause, Mr. President, as you know, a failed state in Venezuela will drive more illegal drug trafficking with its murderous criminal consequences radiating to Panama and to our country to the north. A failed state in Venezuela will drive more illegal migration, compromising our borders, and damaging our economies. And ultimately, a failed state in Venezuela will endanger the security, prosperity, and well-being of the people of Panama, the United States, and the entire region.\nAs you and I discussed, we all live in the same neighborhood. We succeed when our neighbors succeed. We struggle when our neighbors struggle. And so we will continue to act together to support the people of Venezuela in their fight for freedom. And I believe with all my heart with your support, with the growing support of all of our partners and friends across Latin America, the Venezuelan people will be free once more.\nFreedom is the cord that binds the United States and Panama together. Today, we rededicate ourselves to this most cherished value. And we pledge to strengthen our bond, to deepen our friendship, and to continue to work together to advance freedom, security, and prosperity for all our people, for both our nations, and for the wider world.\nThe United States and Panama stand together, and so we always will.\nPresident Varela, thank you again for your hospitality. It's a great honor to be here with you today.", "timestamp": "2017-08-17", "title": "Remarks to the Press by the Vice President and President H.E.

Thank you, Madame Vice President, for those gracious words, and for this warm welcome to Panama for me and my wonderful wife, Karen.\nBefore I begin, I'd like to address the horrific terror attack that occurred just a few hours ago in Barcelona, Spain. The latest scenes of carnage and mayhem sicken us all, and as the President said earlier today, the United States condemns this terror attack, and we will do whatever is necessary to help.\nWhatever inspired today's terror attack, the United States stands ready to assist the people of Spain and find and punish those responsible. On this dark day, our prayers and the prayers of all the American people are with the victims, their families, and the good people of Spain. Thank you.\nVice President Saint Malo, Administrator Quihano, Minister Roy, Ambassador Gonzalez-Revilla, Ambassador Feeley, members of the Panamanian government, distinguished business leaders, outstanding students, and honored guests, it is a privilege for me and my wife, Karen, to be here today at this great pathway to prosperity -- the Panama Canal. Thank you for this very warm welcome. (Applause.)\nAnd I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, and a great supporter of the U.S.-Panamanian relationship -- President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And I'm here today on the President's behalf because the Western Hemisphere and our great ally here in Panama are a key priority for our administration.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States will always put the security and prosperity of America first. But as I hope our presence here today demonstrates, America First does not mean America alone. Today, as in ages past, the interests of the United States and Latin America are intertwined, our security and prosperity will rise in tandem, and our futures are forever linked.\nAs President Trump has said, we will seek, in his words, a future in the Western Hemisphere where the people of each country can live out their dreams. And so I say to all of you: The United States of America stands with Latin America to realize those dreams and achieve the historic progress that will benefit us all.\nOver the past week, I've traveled across the wider region to deepen our friendships and strengthen our partnerships, and there is no better place to conclude my trip than here in Panama. The bond between our nations was forged in the fires of liberty. Ever since the sailors of the USS Nashville helped bring life to Justo Arosemena's dream of Panamanian independence, the American and Panamanian people have been linked.\nThe United States was the first country in the world to recognize Panama as an independent nation. And just as we stood with Panama then, we stand with Panama today as your partner in commerce and your friend in freedom.\nAnd the Panama Canal itself is a manifestation of our bond –- forged with Panamanian grit and American know-how and Pittsburgh steel. It's amazing, as I stand here today beside its newest lock, I cannot help but be humbled by this magnificent monument to our partnership.\nThe story of the Panama Canal is an inspiration and it can never be told enough. For nearly 400 years, kings and traders and travelers alike dreamed of building a water link here, between the Atlantic and the Pacific. They drew their maps. They charted their paths. They surveyed the land around us, but none could figure out how to begin, much less complete, this herculean task.\nNone, that is, until the United States and Panama began to work together, guided by the vision and determination of President Theodore Roosevelt. Where others saw obstacles, we saw opportunity. Where others saw challenges, we saw a chance to change the world. Where others saw the impossible, we saw the inevitable, and we rushed in to meet our destiny.\nBuilding the Panama Canal was a challenge of magnitude, not miracles, and it brought out the best of the American spirit -- our boundless energy, our matchless ingenuity. While the barriers we faced grew more and more, our determination to break them down grew even faster. President Roosevelt declared that we would \"make the dirt fly\". And so we did, together.\nIn the months that followed, more than 50,000 laborers here in Panama cut a great channel across this isthmus. They moved one million cubic yards of solid earth every day at their peak, and poured 3.4 million cubic meters of concrete. And after a decade of ceaseless, back-breaking, grinding toil, 103 years ago this very week the first ship officially sailed through the Miraflores Locks, and the world marveled at the wonder we had wrought together. (Applause.)\nThe Panama Canal changed the face of the Earth. It united the Atlantic and Pacific, and it took not only Panama but the Western Hemisphere from the margins of global commerce to the very center of the world.\nBut just as remarkable is what Panama itself has achieved since you took on the stewardship of this canal just two decades ago. Panama initiated the largest expansion of the canal since its construction more than a century ago, and we stand, right now, at the new Cocoli Locks -- the crowning achievement of this historic project.\nThis expansion was nearly as audacious and momentous as the original construction. It required the excavation of a huge new channel; the expansion of the originals, moving three-quarters as much earth as we did more than a century ago. It put enough steel into the ground to build 29 Eiffel Towers. Yours was an accomplishment of great consequence, and the reverberations can already be felt in the United States and across the wider world.\nThe Panama Canal expansion has resulted in billions of dollars of investment in the United States, creating good-paying jobs for our people in manufacturing and transportation and agriculture. And ports across America are growing to accommodate the new Neopanamax ships in Savannah, Charleston, and many more. In fact, the port of Miami just completed a $2 billion expansion.\nThese expansions prove once again that our prosperity is intertwined. So let me -- with the Vice President here and so many responsible, let me just say congratulations Panama on one more great and extraordinary achievement. (Applause.)\nBut I didn't just come here today to talk about the Panama Canal. More important than this monument to human strength is the spirit that made it possible -- the spirit of optimism, confidence, and the unwavering belief that we can accomplish anything when we steel our minds and embrace our futures together.\nThe challenges and opportunities we face today are different than the ones we faced more than a century ago, but the United States and Panama's drive to achieve them remains just the same.\nAnd in President Donald Trump, I think the United States once again has a President whose vision, energy, and can-do spirit is reminiscent of President Teddy Roosevelt. Think about it. Then, as now, we have a builder of boundless optimism, who seeks to usher in a new era of shared prosperity all across this new world. Then, as now, we have a leader who sees things not just as they are, but for what they could be. And then, as now, we have a President who understands, in his words, \"A nation is only living as long as it is striving.\"\nAnd just as President Roosevelt exhorted his fellow Americans to \"dare to be great,\" President Donald Trump has dared our nation to make America great again, and we'll do it with all of our friends in the world.\nAnd so I say to all of you: Under President Trump, the United States will break new ground and break new records. We'll recapture the spirit and rekindle the vision of our forebears in partnership with the free nations and free peoples across this hemisphere. We will once again awe the world with all that we accomplish together.\nToday, I believe that one of the greatest opportunities before us is to build on the legacy of trade that made the last 100 years so historic for this hemisphere. The Panama Canal is an enduring testament to the power of commerce to transform fortunes and shape the future of nations.\nIn just over a century, more than 1 million ships have traversed these locks. As many as 15,000 ships sail through here every year, and two of every three either began or will conclude their journey in the United States.\nOur prosperity depends on this 48-mile path, and this is even more true following the Panama Canal's expansion and the locks that stand beside me today.\nToday, thanks in no small part to the Panama Canal, the United States is the largest trading partner for nearly two-thirds of the hemisphere, with a total two-way trade of $1.6 trillion.\nWe trade twice as much with our neighbors in this hemisphere as we do with China, and we export more to the Americas than we do to all of Asia combined.\nBut despite this progress, the untapped potential, we believe, is still vast. Global trade is more important than ever before. And the task before us today is how we'll be able to unleash the flow of commerce in new and renewed ways for the benefit of all our nations in this hemisphere.\nAs we speak, countries across this hemisphere are enacting bold reforms to unshackle their economies and empower their citizens to claim their futures. These efforts are important and laudable, and the United States urges continued action by Latin America's leaders to break down barriers to opportunity and success.\nBut so, too, we must together inaugurate a new era of free and fair trade based on the principle of mutual benefit.\nMake no mistake about it: The United States of America wants to trade even more with our neighbors in Latin America. The United States wants to invest more in Latin America. The United States wants to share our business culture of entrepreneurship, innovation, and transparency on an increasing basis with Latin America because your prosperity and our prosperity are inextricably linked.\nPresident Trump has taken decisive action to ensure that our prosperity continues to advance together.\nIn fact, President Trump is already getting results, and thanks to his leadership, this has been a good week for American workers.\nEarlier this week in Colombia, I was pleased to announce that the United States has reached an agreement to allow Colombian Hass avocados into the U.S. market. And Colombia has expanded access for U.S. rough rice -- a deal that will benefit American agriculture for decades to come.\nAnd following my visit to Argentina this week, just moments ago, President Trump announced that after 25 years of barriers, American pork will once again be able to be exported to Argentina, and American farmers and ranchers will reap the reward.\nAnd to keep up this progress, at this very moment, our administration is reviewing all of our existing trade agreements and exploring new bilateral agreements. And in all that we do, President Trump will be fighting to ensure that our trade agreements are free and fair and create jobs and opportunities for workers in the United States and in the nations that partner with us.\nThe United States has free-trade agreements with 12 countries in this hemisphere, including Panama. These deals have been beneficial, but however good our agreements may be, they can all, invariably, be made much better.\nThat's why just yesterday, the United States, Mexico, and Canada officially began to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nSimply put, we seek a deal in the original spirit of NAFTA -- one that holds to our highest ideals of free and fair trade and brings tangible benefits to American workers. And Canada and Mexico agree that NAFTA has significant room for improvement to ensure a level playing field for all.\nAnd as I told Prime Minister Trudeau last month, we will work together for a win-win-win outcome as we renegotiate NAFTA. And I'm confident that under President Trump's leadership, we will modernize NAFTA and bring it into the 21st century.\nThe President and I are committed to bring this vision of mutually beneficial trade to all of the United States' commercial relationships, in the Western Hemisphere, and all over the world. And the closer we come to creating a trade system that's free and fair, the more we will unlock the vast untapped prosperity that will enrich our citizens for generations to come.\nThe opportunity is ours, and so is the obligation. And we will seize it, together.\nToday, I believe our future is bright -- brighter than ever before. But as I close, let me simply say that I believe it could be brighter still -- if this new world finally and fully embraces our heritage of freedom.\nThe past half-century has seen so much of Latin America travel the road to liberty. It's been inspiring to watch. Yet sadly, Venezuela has gone in the opposite direction -- toward dictatorship, not democracy; toward oppression, not freedom; toward the past, and not the future.\nIn Venezuela, we are seeing the tragedy of tyranny play out before our very eyes. As President Trump has said, the Venezuelan people are suffering and they are dying.\nI saw it myself earlier this week in Colombia when Karen and I visited with families who had fled from the horrors of their homeland in Venezuela. They told me of the grinding poverty, of the crime and violence ripping apart their communities. They told me how their families couldn't find food and medicine, and how innocent children are literally perishing every day because of deprivation and starvation.\nToday, the once-free people of Venezuela are being forced to endure that fate by the brutality of the Maduro regime. No free people has ever chosen to walk the path from prosperity to poverty. No free people has ever chosen to turn what was once, and should still be, one of South America's richest nations into its poorest and most corrupt.\nPresident Donald Trump has made it clear: \"The United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\"\nAnd I can assure you we will continue to stand with free nations across the hemisphere until democracy is restored for the Venezuelan people.\nPresident Trump and I are truly grateful for President Varela's strong leadership in condemning the Maduro regime. We commend Panama in particular for joining 11 other countries to sign the Lima Declaration just last week, which sends a powerful message that free peoples of the Americas will stand with the Venezuelan people and stand up to their oppressors.\nBut President Trump and I call on Latin America to do more. And be confident of this: The United States will continue to bring the full measure of American economic and diplomatic power to bear until democracy is restored in Venezuela.\nAs President Trump said just a few days ago, \"We have many options for Venezuela.\" But the President and I remain confident that working together with all our allies across Latin America, we will achieve a peaceable solution to the crisis facing the Venezuelan people.\nNow we do this because it's right. The Venezuelan people deserve freedom. And we do this as President Trump has said -- because in his words, a \"stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of the entire hemisphere.\"\nFailed states have no borders. A failed state in Venezuela will drive more illegal drug trafficking, with its murderous criminal consequences, radiating outward through Colombia and Panama and north to our country. A failed state in Venezuela will drive more illegal migration, corroding our borders, burdening our economies. And ultimately, a failed state in Venezuela will endanger the well-being of all who call the Western Hemisphere home.\nThe truth is we all live in the same neighborhood. We succeed when our neighbors succeed. We struggle when our neighbors struggle. And so we will continue to act together to support the people of Venezuela in their fight for freedom. And I believe with all of my heart that Venezuela will be free once more. (Applause.)\nThe truth is freedom is the birthright and legacy of all the peoples of this New World. And just as freedom gave our nations birth and our peoples purpose, it is freedom that will guide us as we embark upon this new era in this New World. And together we will show, in the words of President Roosevelt, the power of devotion to this lofty ideal of liberty.\nThe task before us will require renewed determination and courage and commitment. But as the Good Book says, if we are diligent in our efforts, we will see progress for us all.\nAnd so I have faith -- faith that the winds of progress are at our back, that we will catch those winds. And I have faith that they will carry us foward together to a future of freedom for the people of Panama, the people of the United States, and for the people of this New World.\nThank you. God bless you. God bless Panama and God bless the United States of America.

Today, more than one million citizen soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen continue this proud legacy as members of the National Guard and Reserve. During National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, we express our gratitude to the employers and communities who support those brave men and women.\nEmployer support for the National Guard and Reserve is important to our ability to sustain an all-volunteer force. Employers play a vital role in easing the transitions our national guardsmen and reservists must make from civilian life to military service and back again. Whether they are participating in weekend training in support of readiness or deploying in response to a crisis at home and abroad, our national guardsmen and reservists are more effective when they have the support of civilian employers.\nOur Nation salutes our employers and business leaders who, often at their own expense, back their employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve. As President, I will continue to focus on providing our men and women in uniform and their families with access to the services, benefits, and care they so deserve. I encourage all Americans to join with our employers in facilitating the service our national guardsmen and reservists provide to our Nation and honoring the sacrifices they make in defense of our security.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 20 through August 26, 2017, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. I call upon all Americans to join me in expressing our heartfelt thanks to the civilian employers who provide critical support to the men and women of the National Guard and Reserve. I also call on State and local officials, private organizations, and all military commanders to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\nDONALD J.

Please be seated.\nVice President Pence, Secretary of State Tillerson, members of the Cabinet, General Dunford, Deputy Secretary Shanahan, and Colonel Duggan. Most especially, thank you to the men and women of Fort Myer and every member of the United States military at home and abroad. We send our thoughts and prayers to the families of our brave sailors who were injured and lost after a tragic collision at sea, as well as to those conducting the search-and-recovery efforts.\nI am here tonight to lay out our path forward in Afghanistan and South Asia. But before I provide the details of our new strategy, I want to say a few words to the servicemembers here with us tonight, to those watching from their posts, and to all Americans listening at home.\nSince the founding of our Republic, our country has produced a special class of heroes whose selflessness, courage, and resolve is unmatched in human history. American patriots from every generation have given their last breath on the battlefield for our Nation and for our freedom. Through their lives—and though their lives were cut short, in their deeds they achieved total immortality.\nBy following the heroic example of those who fought to preserve our republic, we can find the inspiration our country needs to unify, to heal, and to remain one Nation under God. The men and women of our military operate as one team, with one shared mission and one shared sense of purpose. They transcend every line of race, ethnicity, creed, and color to serve together—and sacrifice together—in absolutely perfect cohesion. That is because all servicemembers are brothers and sisters. They're all part of the same family; it's called the American family. They take the same oath, fight for the same flag, and live according to the same law. They are bound together by common purpose, mutual trust, and selfless devotion to our Nation and to each other.\nThe soldier understands what we, as a Nation, too often forget: that a wound inflicted upon a single member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all. When one part of America hurts, we all hurt. And when one citizen suffers an injustice, we all suffer together. Loyalty to our Nation demands loyalty to one another. Love for America requires love for all of its people. When we open our hearts to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice, no place for bigotry, and no tolerance for hate.\nThe young men and women we send to fight our wars abroad deserve to return to a country that is not at war with itself at home. We cannot remain a force for peace in the world if we are not at peace with each other. As we send our bravest to defeat our enemies overseas—and we will always win—let us find the courage to heal our divisions within. Let us make a simple promise to the men and women we ask to fight in our name that, when they return home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one.\nThanks to the vigilance and skill of the American military and of our many allies throughout the world, horrors on the scale of September 11—and nobody can ever forget that—have not been repeated on our shores. But we must also acknowledge the reality I am here to talk about tonight: that nearly 16 years after September 11 attacks, after the extraordinary sacrifice of blood and treasure, the American people are weary of war without victory. Nowhere is this more evident than with the war in Afghanistan, the longest war in American history, 17 years.\nI share the American people's frustration. I also share their frustration over a foreign policy that has spent too much time, energy, money, and most importantly, lives trying to rebuild countries in our own image, instead of pursuing our security interests above all other considerations.\nThat is why, shortly after my Inauguration, I directed Secretary of Defense Mattis and my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review of all strategic options in Afghanistan and South Asia. My original instinct was to pull out, and historically, I like following my instincts. But all my life, I've heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office, in other words, when you're President of the United States. So I studied Afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle. After many meetings, over many months, we held our final meeting last Friday at Camp David, with my Cabinet and generals, to complete our strategy. I arrived at three fundamental conclusion about America's core interests in Afghanistan.\nFirst, our Nation must seek an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made, especially the sacrifices of lives. The men and women who serve our Nation in combat deserve a plan for victory. They deserve the tools they need—and the trust they have earned—to fight and to win.\nSecond, the consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable. Nine-eleven, the worst terrorist attack in our history, was planned and directed from Afghanistan because that country was ruled by a government that gave comfort and shelter to terrorists. A hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum that terrorists, including ISIS and Al Qaida, would instantly fill, just as happened before September 11.\nAnd as we know, in 2011, America hastily and mistakenly withdrew from Iraq. As a result, our hard-won gains slipped back into the hands of terrorist enemies. Our soldiers watched as cities they had fought for and bled to liberate and won were occupied by a terrorist group called ISIS. The vacuum we created by leaving too soon gave safe haven for ISIS to spread, to grow, recruit, and launch attacks. We cannot repeat in Afghanistan the mistake our leaders made in Iraq.\nThird and finally, I concluded that the security threats we face in Afghanistan and the broader region are immense. Today, 20 U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations are active in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the highest concentration in any region anywhere in the world. For its part, Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and terror. The threat is worse because Pakistan and India are two nuclear-armed states whose tense relations threaten to spiral into conflict. And that could happen.\nNo one denies that we have inherited a challenging and troubling situation in Afghanistan and South Asia, but we do not have the luxury of going back in time and making different or better decisions. When I became President, I was given a bad and very complex hand, but I fully knew what I was getting into: big and intricate problems. But one way or another, these problems will be solved—I'm a problem solver—and in the end, we will win. We must address the reality of the world as it exists right now: the threats we face, and the confronting of all of the problems of today and extremely predictable consequences of a hasty withdrawal. We need look no further than last week's vile, vicious attack in Barcelona to understand that terror groups will stop at nothing to commit the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children. You saw it for yourself. Horrible.\nAs I outlined in my speech in Saudi Arabia 3 months ago, America and our partners are committed to stripping terrorists of their territory, cutting off their funding, and exposing the false allure of their evil ideology. Terrorists who slaughter innocent people will find no glory in this life or the next. They are nothing but thugs and criminals and predators and—that's right—losers. Working alongside our allies, we will break their will, dry up their recruitment, keep them from crossing our borders, and yes, we will defeat them, and we will defeat them handily.\nIn Afghanistan and Pakistan, America's interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us or anywhere in the world for that matter. But to prosecute this war, we will learn from history. As a result of our comprehensive review, American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia will change dramatically in the following ways:\nA core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions. I've said it many times how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance the dates we intend to begin or end military options. We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities. Conditions on the ground—not arbitrary timetables—will guide our strategy from now on. America's enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out. I will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will.\nAnother fundamental pillar of our new strategy is the integration of all instruments of American power—diplomatic, economic, and military—toward a successful outcome. Someday, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan, but nobody knows if or when that will ever happen. America will continue its support for the Afghan Government and the Afghan military as they confront the Taliban in the field.\nUltimately, it is up to the people of Afghanistan to take ownership of their future, to govern their society, and to achieve an everlasting peace. We are a partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live or how to govern their own complex society. We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists.\nThe next pillar of our new strategy is to change the approach and how to deal with Pakistan. We can no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond. Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan. It has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists.\nIn the past, Pakistan has been a valued partner. Our militaries have worked together against common enemies. The Pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism. We recognize those contributions and those sacrifices.\nBut Pakistan has also sheltered the same organizations that try every single day to kill our people. We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change, and that will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country's harboring of militants and terrorists who target U.S. servicemembers and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order, and to peace.\nAnother critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India, the world's largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States. We appreciate India's important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. We are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region.\nFinally, my administration will ensure that you, the brave defenders of the American people, will have the necessary tools and rules of engagement to make this strategy work and work effectively and work quickly. I have already lifted restrictions the previous administration placed on our warfighters that prevented the Secretary of Defense and our commanders in the field from fully and swiftly waging battle against the enemy. Micromanagement from Washington, DC, does not win battles. They're won in the field drawing upon the judgment and expertise of wartime commanders and frontline soldiers acting in real time, with real authority, and with a clear mission to defeat the enemy.\nThat's why we will also expand authority for American Armed Forces to target the terrorist and criminal networks that sow violence and chaos throughout Afghanistan. These killers need to know they have nowhere to hide; that no place is beyond the reach of American might and Americans arms. Retribution will be fast and powerful.\nAs we lift restrictions and expand authorities in the field, we are already seeing dramatic results in the campaign to defeat ISIS, including the liberation of Mosul in Iraq. Since my Inauguration, we have achieved record-breaking success in that regard. We will also maximize sanctions and other financial and law enforcement actions against these networks to eliminate their ability to export terror. When America commits its warriors to battle, we must ensure they have every weapon to apply swift, decisive, and overwhelming force.\nOur troops will fight to win. We will fight to win. From now on, victory will have a clear definition: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing Al Qaida, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.\nWe will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy with additional troop and funding increases in line with our own. We are confident they will. Since taking office, I have made clear that our allies and partners must contribute much more money to our collective defense, and they have done so.\nIn this struggle, the heaviest burden will continue to be borne by the good people of Afghanistan and their courageous armed forces. As the Prime Minister of Afghanistan has promised, we are going to participate in economic development to help defray the cost of this war to us. Afghanistan is fighting to defend and secure their country against the same enemies who threaten us. The stronger the Afghan security forces become, the less we will have to do. Afghans will secure and build their own nation and define their own future. We want them to succeed. But we will no longer use American military might to construct democracies in faraway lands or try to rebuild other countries in our own image. Those days are now over. Instead, we will work with allies and partners to protect our shared interests. We are not asking others to change their way of life, but to pursue common goals that allow our children to live better and safer lives. This principled realism will guide our decisions moving forward.\nMilitary power alone will not bring peace to Afghanistan or stop the terrorist threat arising in that country. But strategically applied force aims to create the conditions for a political process to achieve a lasting peace.\nAmerica will work with the Afghan Government as long as we see determination and progress. However, our commitment is not unlimited, and our support is not a blank check. The Government of Afghanistan must carry their share of the military, political, and economic burden. The American people expect to see real reforms, real progress, and real results. Our patience is not unlimited. We will keep our eyes wide open.\nIn abiding by the oath I took on January 20, I will remain steadfast in protecting American lives and American interests. In this effort, we will make common cause with any nation that chooses to stand and fight alongside us against this global threat. Terrorists take heed: America will never let up until you are dealt a lasting defeat.\nUnder my administration, many billions of dollars more is being spent on our military. And this includes vast amounts being spent on our nuclear arsenal and missile defense.\nIn every generation, we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed. We prevailed because we know who we are and what we are fighting for. Not far from where we are gathered tonight, hundreds of thousands of America's greatest patriots lay in eternal rest at Arlington National Cemetery. There is more courage, sacrifice, and love in those hallowed grounds than in any other spot on the face of the Earth.\nMany of those who have fought and died in Afghanistan enlisted in the months after September 11, 2001. They volunteered for a simple reason: They loved America, and they were determined to protect her.\nNow we must secure the cause for which they gave their lives. We must unite to defend America from its enemies abroad. We must restore the bonds of loyalty among our citizens at home, and we must achieve an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the enormous price that so many have paid.\nOur actions, and in the months to come, all of them will honor the sacrifice of every fallen hero, every family who lost a loved one, and every wounded warrior who shed their blood in defense of our great nation. With our resolve, we will ensure that your service and that your families will bring about the defeat of our enemies and the arrival of peace. We will push onward to victory with power in our hearts, courage in our souls, and everlasting pride in each and every one of you.\nThank you. May God bless our military.

MST\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Good afternoon. The President is going to visit a U.S. Customs and Border Protection hangar facility where we have unmanned aerial systems and some other tools and techniques we use to patrol the border.\nThe visit to Yuma is very relevant because it's an area where the strategy that the President is pursuing, articulated in his executive order, emphasized in his budget request for FY18, has worked, and worked dramatically. By putting up a border wall, by adding agents from 200 to 800, between 2005 and 2009, and including the technology and access roads needed to patrol the border effectively, apprehensions were reduced from 138,000 crossings in 2005, in just three years, down to under 10,000.\nThat's the kind of success that the President's strategy can realize in other parts of the border that are busier, such as Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. So it's a really important stop to emphasize his strategy and his message.\nMR. HOMAN: I'm Tom Homan from ICE. Look, I'm here to support our sister agency, CBP. Look, immigration enforcement is more meaningful when you have a true interior enforcement strategy, which we have under this President.\nSo as a CBP official just said, the numbers on the border are down drastically, almost 70 percent last month. That comes hand in hand with better border security, better tools, better equipment, better technology on the border, together with a strong interior enforcement.\nInterior enforcement is meaningful. For those who get by the Border Patrol, they need to understand there's no safe haven in the United States. So they got to understand, if you get by the Border Patrol, ICE is looking for you. I think hand in hand, ICE and Border Patrol is sending that message, and I think it has a direct reflect on the kind of apprehensions on the southwest border.\nQ: What's the President's message to the Senate on this border issue with the funding held up?\nMR. HOMAN: Look, I think the President's message is, we need a strong border and we need strong interior enforcement. What he's done so far has worked, so we need the funding to make it permanent. We need funding to build a wall.\nLook, I've been doing this 33 years; I started in the Border Patrol. The border wall is successful. Wherever that border wall has been built, the numbers have declined. Less drugs, less bad people, less illegal aliens coming in. I mean bad people, I mean anybody who wants to come into this country and do harm.\nThe border wall works every place it's been -- San Diego, Yuma, El Paso. It's worked. It declined in apprehensions, declined in crossings. And I think together with interior enforcement, the President's plan is working. So the funding needs to come through to make this a permanent fix. We can only get better with more funding, more equipment, and more manpower.\nQ: Just to be clear, those measures were made during the previous administration. Is that right?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: They were made during the Bush administration, those investments, and sustained. But, really, the FY18 request is a reasonable, balanced request of a border wall -- $1.6 billion -- as well as technology, additional Border Patrol agents, additional ICE agents, and access and surveillance equipment that will let us patrol that border more successfully. So it's a balanced request that we support strongly at the operational level.\nMR. HOMAN: Look, I think the message being sent on interior enforcement -- which wasn't part of the last administration, not to the extent it is now -- interior enforcement is sending that clear message that if you are lucky enough to get by the Border Patrol, in the last administration you're home free unless you commit yet another crime and get arrested and get put in jail, and get convicted of that crime. Now the message is clear: If you're in the United States illegally, if you happen to get by the Border Patrol, someone is looking for you. And that message is clear and I think it has a direct impact on the decrease in apprehensions.\nQ: Do you think the President should pardon Joe Arpaio?\nMS. SANDERS: I can speak to that, actually. I know that that's a question that you guys have asked a lot today. I can tell you that there will be no discussion of that today at any point, and no action will be taken on that front at any point today.\nQ: And, Sarah, tonight is the first time the President has done a rally since the Charlottesville events of about over a week ago. What kind of a tone does he want to set when he's speaking before supporters tonight?\nMS. SANDERS: This is a campaign event, so I can't get too deep into the specifics just because of the legal lines there. But I think the President was clear last night on what he feels like the tone of the country should be. I think he's been clear in every statement that he's made, and condemns hate in all form. He has been consistent in that, and I think you'll see that again not just tonight but throughout his tenure as President.\nQ: Did he have any hesitation about doing this after the mayor of Phoenix encouraged him not to come, and just after the response to his comments last Tuesday?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't spoken to him directly about that, so I'm not sure if there was a hesitation on that front. But I think the President always appreciates the opportunity and the ability to talk directly to the American people. I think we saw that last night, and that certainly was a great moment and a positive step forward. And I think that he'll continue to do that. And the more that the President has the ability to talk directly to the American people, that's always a good thing.\nAll right, guys, I'll come back in between. If you guys have one or two more questions for these guys --\nQ: What will he be doing between --\nMS. SANDERS: We're going to sit down during the landing, but I'll come back if you guys want to ask one or two more questions of these guys before the stop.\nQ: Is there anything we'll see today in terms of technology that is specifically new since the Trump administration came into office?\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No. Those budget procurements are still happening under the FY17 budget. But this is technology that the President is investing in and is sustaining that's going to improve our capability. We're going to be getting more hours for our UAS and more mobile surveillance systems that aren't going to be demonstrated today.\nEND 1:37 P.M.

Trump\nVISITING LAW ENFORCEMENT DEFENDING OUR BORDERS: Today, President Donald J. Trump is seeing first-hand the people and tools restoring law and order to our southern border.\n* President Trump is visiting Yuma, Arizona, the main base of operations for the U.S. Border Patrol's (USBP) Yuma Sector to evaluate results, initiatives, and morale as he seeks to increase support for the USBP.\n* President Trump will meet U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel and the state-of-the-art equipment used to secure our border. Equipment being viewed includes:\n* MQ-9 Predator B unmanned aircraft\n* UH-60 Black Hawk Helicopter\n* Super King Air 350ER aircraft\n* He will also receive a briefing on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) efforts on the southern border to prevent illegal entry into the country.\nBUILDING A WALL TO SECURE THE BORDER: President Trump is following through on his promise to the American people to build a wall to secure the southern border and the Yuma Sector is a clear example of how effective the wall can be.\n* Illegal border crossings in the Yuma Sector have declined by 70 percent from 2006, when the Yuma Sector built more than 50 miles of border wall.\n* President Trump has acted to build a wall to finally secure the southern border and prevent illegal immigration from spilling into the country.\n* To jumpstart construction on the border wall, President Trump ordered DHS to use $20 million of unspent appropriations in its account for border security, fencing, and infrastructure.\n* DHS has authorized a waiver to expedite a 15-mile stretch of wall near San Diego.\n* President Trump has worked with Congress to pass border wall funding and the House of Representatives passed $1.6 billion to fund 28 miles of new border wall and 46 miles of new and secondary fencing.\nRESTORING LAW AND ORDER: President Trump has made immigration enforcement one of the top priorities of his Administration, devoting resources and putting in place new mandates requiring enforcement of immigration laws.\n* One of President Trump's first Executive Orders informed sanctuary cities that failure to fully abide by Federal immigration laws would jeopardize access to certain Federal grant money.\n* As a result, Miami-Dade County reversed its years-long sanctuary policies.\n* Earlier this month, the Department of Justice (DOJ) determined Miami-Dade County to be \"in compliance\" with immigration laws.\n* Last month, DOJ laid out new guidelines requiring jurisdictions to cooperate with Federal immigration authorities in order to receive Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants, a leading source of Federal law enforcement funding.\n* The DOJ issued new charging guidelines in April to end catch-and-release policies by prioritizing criminal immigration enforcement to prevent and deter illegal immigration.\n* The President ordered the hiring of 10,000 new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents.\n* 54 additional immigration judges have been hired since President Trump took office to speed up the removal of illegal aliens from the United States, and new immigration judges are hired every month.\n* President Trump ordered the creation of the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) office at DHS, ensuring victims of criminal acts by illegal aliens are no longer ignored by the Federal Government.\nRESULTS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: In less than a year, President Trump has made substantial progress reducing illegal immigration along the southern border and targeting the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens in the country.\n* President Trump instituted tough immigration policies that have reduced illegal border crossings over the southwest border by 47 percent compared to the same period last year.\n* Illegal aliens removed due to ICE arrests have increased by over 32 percent, to 48,580 illegal aliens, compared to the same time last year.\n* 71 percent of the more than 91,000 administrative arrests conducted by ICE since President Trump's inauguration have involved convicted criminal aliens.\n* Of the illegal aliens arrested without criminal convictions, 74 percent were charged with a crime, were immigration fugitives, or were repeat violators.\n* So far in fiscal year 2017, ICE has removed over 2,700 criminal gang members, compared to 2,057 criminal gang members in all of fiscal year 2016.\n* During Project New Dawn, a nationwide, six-week operation, ICE officers and agents arrested 1,378 suspected gang members.\n* 104 of those arrested were members or associates of MS-13.\n* Operation Matador in the New York City metropolitan area has led to nearly 140 arrests, the vast majority affiliated with MS-13.\nNEW TOOLS TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS: President Trump is working with Congress to pass tough new laws to secure the border, strengthen immigration enforcement, and increase penalties for breaking our immigration laws.\n* President Trump supports the passage of Kate's Law to increase mandatory penalties for illegal aliens who re-enter the United States to a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 25 years.\n* President Trump supports the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which would block localities that do not cooperate with immigration enforcement from receiving many Federal grants.\n* President Trump supports the Davis-Oliver Act, which would restrict Federal money to sanctuary communities, increase funding to local communities enforcing immigration laws, and raise penalties for immigration crimes.", "timestamp": "2017-08-22", "title": "Press Release - Fact Sheet: President Donald J.

After years of careless immigration policies and leaders who have turned a blind eye to the chaos at our southern border, it's reassuring we now have a President who treats illegal immigration like the national security crisis that it is. In seven short months, the Trump Administration has already worked to advance Kate's Law, stop sanctuary cities from harboring illegal aliens, enforce existing deportation laws, decrease illegal border crossings, and tackle the problems at the root of our broken immigration system. Today's visit is further proof of President Trump's commitment to protecting all Americans.\"\nRep. Louie Gohmert: \"The best thing we can do for BOTH the United States and Mexico is to secure our border. Thankfully, we have a President who understands and is committed to that. A nation founded on laws that apply to everyone, where neither rich nor poor are above the law, must enforce the law to maintain its integrity, fairness, justice and opportunity. If we secure and enforce our border properly, Mexico's drug cartels will be reduced dramatically, which will reduce corruption and lawlessness in Mexico, and help Mexico finally achieve its place as one of the top economies and vibrant countries in the world. A good neighbor would help Mexico in this way. Thankfully, we have a President who not only understands the importance of security and the rule of law, but is doing all he can to make such security, propriety, and opportunity a reality.\"\nRep. Jim Jordan: \"Today President Trump will visit the U.S./Mexico border and reaffirm his commitment to securing our border. Under President Trump, the number of people trying to enter the United States illegally has dropped significantly. But we need to do more. I agree with the President that secure borders are a vital part of our national security. For the good of our country, Congress should include border wall funding in government funding legislation this fall. It's what we ran on – we need to fulfill that promise.\"\nRep. Dan Donovan: \"The President is bringing much-needed focus to the crucial first step in solving our immigration crisis: securing the border. Reforming our broken immigration system will be a pointless exercise if we can't stop illegal entries. I look forward to continuing to work with the President and my colleagues in Congress on this critical matter.\"\nRep. Mike Johnson: \"Securing our borders is critical to preserving our national security, and President Trump has made this a top priority during his time in office. Since his inauguration, illegal border crossings have decreased significantly. Just the idea of a strong leader willing to do what it takes to enforce our laws has slowed the flow of illegal immigrants across our border. Still, terrorists continue to exploit weaknesses in immigration laws across the world to carry out their attacks. Now, more than ever, it is imperative we reverse the previous years of lax enforcement and re-establish stability in our immigration system to better protect our nation and our people.\"\nRep. Earl L. \"Buddy\" Carter: \"President Trump's unyielding commitment to securing our borders and protecting the American people is already producing results. In the past seven months, the number of people arrested trying to enter the country illegal has been nearly halved. It's clear the world knows America is serious about enforcing our laws. What's more, the President's commitment has also boosted the morale of our law enforcement agents along the border because they know he's got their backs. The President's steadfast support for securing our borders is spurring Congress to action. I've been proud to help deliver to his desk the biggest boost to border security in years with $1.5 billion in additional resources. In the House, we've also fully funded the President's wall, passed Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act to further bolster our efforts.\"\nRep. Mark Meadows: \"The President's visit to Yuma, Arizona will be a critical step in highlighting the needs of our border patrol operations and evaluating the challenges they face in keeping our country safe. I applaud President Trump for his leadership on this issue and for his relentless commitment to keeping a promise that was central to his campaign. Congress would do well to join the President and follow through on our own promises by including funding for a border wall in upcoming spending bills--anything less will show that we are not serious about keeping our word to the American people.\"\nRep. Andy Harris: \"In the first seven months of 2017, the United States Border Patrol saw a 46% decrease in the number of illegal border crossing attempts and apprehensions from the same seven-month window in 2016. I applaud the United States Border Patrol and Department of Homeland Security for their hard work in reducing the rate of illegal border crossings, and I am proud to support increased funding for securing our borders in the FY18 spending bill. Through increased border security and legislation like the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, the Trump Administration and Congress are making great strides to end illegal immigration, making American citizens safer and more prosperous.\"\nRep. John Ratcliffe: \"I'd like to thank the Trump administration for working closely with Congress on securing our borders and enforcing our immigration laws. After the Obama administration's failure to protect the sovereignty and integrity of our territorial borders – which led to more crimes within our borders and the unnecessary loss of life at the hands of criminal aliens – it's encouraging that President Trump's commitment to prioritizing border security has already made our country a safer place. As a member of the House Judiciary and Homeland Security committees, I look forward to continuing my work alongside the Trump administration in building upon the progress we've made so far, so we can deliver on our promise to protect the American people.\"\nRep. Morgan Griffith: \"A weak border has consequences for the whole country. National security is jeopardized when we don't know who is entering and leaving. The rule of law is diminished. Opportunities for legal immigrants who follow the rules are closed. Dangerous and addicting substances routinely cross the border. The 2016 National Drug Threat Assessment found that Mexican transnational criminal organizations, which control smuggling corridors across the border, are the biggest criminal drug threat to the United States. Lax border security has fueled the opioid epidemic, the ready availability of meth, fentanyl, and the resurgence of cocaine. Parts of the country far from the border are in pain because the Federal Government didn't do enough to control who or what entered our territory. Fortunately, the Trump Administration has shown that it takes enforcement seriously. The proof is in the numbers. Apprehensions at the border from January 1 to July 31 of this year are almost half of what they were in the same period last year, a sign that many are choosing not to risk illegal border crossings. We should build on this success to further guarantee the integrity of our borders. To that end, I supported the inclusion of funding for a border wall in the appropriations bill the House passed last month and urge that it be kept in any bill to fund the government.\"\nRep. Andy Biggs: \"I am pleased to welcome President Trump back to Arizona. We are privileged to host him in the Grand Canyon State. Since President Trump took office in January, confidence in the economy has rebounded. Immigration laws have been enforced, and the number of illegal aliens pouring across our southern border has slowed. Onerous job-killing regulations have been slashed, freeing up major sectors of the American economy to revitalize job growth. Neil Gorsuch, a Constitutional constructionist, has taken his seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. Law and order will no longer be ignored. Our military has been empowered to keep our nation safe through strength. Life has been protected. President Trump has been successful in many of his quests to make America great again, and some of his battles are only beginning. As the President visits Yuma and the border today, I encourage the country – and our leaders – to renew our resolve to secure the border and to build the promised wall. The House of Representatives has already passed legislation providing border wall funding, and I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will do the same in September. We have no excuses for an unsecured border. President Trump realizes that, and the American people realize that. It is time for Congress to come to that realization when we reconvene.\"", "timestamp": "2017-08-23", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying: Praise for Donald J.

The President's strong action has caused illegal immigration to drop significantly at the U.S.-Mexico border. In addition to this progress, we also need to improve our nation's immigration laws and provide more tools to further reduce illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and human smuggling. The House of Representatives recently passed the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate's Law. These bills combat dangerous sanctuary policies that allow criminals to remain on our streets and punish felons who repeatedly enter the U.S. illegally, respectively. Both of these bills would dramatically improve public safety and I call on the Senate again to pass them without delay. The House Judiciary Committee has also approved a number of bills to strengthen the enforcement of our immigration laws within the interior of the United States, reform the refugee and asylum programs, and ensure unaccompanied minors who make the dangerous journey to the U.S. are safely returned home. The House must pass all these bills to provide the Trump Administration the tools needed to secure the border and enforce our immigration laws, and to ensure that future administrations do not ignore immigration enforcement laws.\"\nRep. Kevin Cramer: \"Actions speak louder than words. Due to President Trump's commitment to renewing border security, apprehensions are down 46% in the short time since he took office. Indeed, we are a nation of immigrants, but unlike our previous commander and chief, President Trump is setting the record straight that all immigrants must come here legally – the way our ancestors did. But, the President can't do this alone.

Under the leadership of President Trump and with a Republican majority in the House and Senate, a $1.5 billion boost for our border security is now law. This will also enable the federal government to hire more agents, enhance technology, update infrastructure, help deter and prevent illegal aliens from crossing our borders, and stem the flow of illegal activities, such as the smuggling of drugs, into our country. I've also voted for measures, such as Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, to increase the penalty for deported criminals who re-enter the United States, protect law-abiding citizens and withhold federal grants from cities that do not comply with federal immigration laws. I applaud President Trump's efforts to fulfill his campaign promise to make the security at our southern borders a top priority, and I look forward to continuing to work with him to implement his comprehensive strategy to secure our nation – both at home and abroad.\"\nRep. Bruce Westerman: \"Our nation's southern border has lacked necessary security and control for too long. I have toured the border first hand and will be making additional trips. While the brave men and women of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection do an outstanding job with the resources at their disposal, they are unable to prevent the immense flow of illegal immigrants, deadly narcotics, and illicit contraband from pouring into our country. President Trump today proved he is serious about securing our borders and protecting American citizens at home. I applaud his efforts and pledge to continue working with him in the months and years to come as we bring real security and control to our southern border.\"\nRep. Doug Collins: \"Sanctuary cities and illegal criminals have been put on notice. From 2016 to 2017, illegal border crossings fell 52% for the period covering February to March. A human smuggler based at our southwest border reports that his business is at an all-time low. He's considering a career change. At the same time, the House continues to work with President Trump to strengthen immigration enforcement policy through legislation like Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and it's clear that 2017 has brought new perspective to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. As President Trump visits our southern border and we consider the status of illegal immigration into our country today, we realize that the safety of Americans and the rule of law are once again non-negotiables.\"\nRep. Pete Olson: \"Texas like Arizona is on the front lines of our nation's border security crisis. For too long, our border patrol was hamstrung by policies of the Obama Administration that emboldened illegal border crossings by drug cartels and criminal aliens seeking to harm our communities. Through executive action and working with a Republican Congress, President Trump has taken important steps to turn the tide and these steps are working. This year, the Immigration Customs and Enforcement Agency has already removed over 2,700 criminal gang members, compared to 2,057 in all of 2016. The House has passed Kate's Law to expand penalties for returning deported, illegal immigrants who commit more crimes, and a bill to block funds for sanctuary cities. We also passed a spending bill that funds President Trump's border wall. I urge my Senate colleagues to stand with our President and pass these bills as well.

(Applause.)\nThe President announced a new policy to support the Cuban people's nearly six-decade struggle for liberty that will ensure that U.S. dollars will no longer prop up a military monopoly that exploits and abuses them.\nUnder President Donald Trump, it will always be \"Kay viva Cuba libre!\" (Applause.)\nAnd as President Trump said that day, under his administration, we know it is best for America and best for our hemisphere to have freedom for all of our people and a future where all the people of this hemisphere in each our countries can live out our dreams.\nThis is the spirit that we bring to our partnerships across the Western Hemisphere.\nLast week, President Trump sent me to Central and South America, as the first member of our administration to visit the region, to deliver a message -- under President Donald Trump, the United States will always put the security and prosperity of America first. But America First does not mean America alone. (Applause.)\nAnd as the President has said, in his words, \"America stands with all of the people in our great hemisphere yearning to be free\" -- and our administration is working hand-in-hand with free nations across Latin America to make this vision a reality.\nThe United States stands with our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere because our security and our prosperity are inextricably linked. Our interests are aligned. Our values are the same, and the birthright of freedom belongs to all of our people in this New World.\nA prosperous Latin America means a prosperous United States. A secure Latin America means a more secure United States.\nAnd the advance of freedom and democracy in Latin America benefits the cause of freedom everywhere. (Applause.) Because when free peoples stand together, there's nothing that we can't accomplish. And today as we look across Latin America, the winds of progress are at our back.\nLast week, I saw an opening all across Latin America of new pathways to prosperity creating new opportunities for progress. And we welcome this. We're confident that our nations' leaders can go even further in the days ahead.\nIn Colombia, I challenged President Santos to consolidate peace in that great country and offered America's support as they walk this road.\nIn Argentina, I praised President Macri for his bold reform, which is restoring Argentina's economy and renewing their leadership around the world.\nIn Chile, I met with President Bachelet, and I thanked her and her country for their continued example of free-market reforms.\nAnd I concluded my trip in Panama, where I visited that great pathway of prosperity, the Panama Canal and thanked them for all of their cooperation in security and commerce. (Applause.)\nBut for all the progress in our economies, we must never forget that security is the foundation of our prosperity. And here, too, Latin America has made important strides to ensure the safety of the region's citizens.\nAs so many in this room know, the most immediate threat to Latin America's security is the menace of transnational crime and the drug trade that sustains it.\nThe drug trade is a wellspring of violence, crime, and corruption -- victimizing people of all walks of life in every corner of our hemisphere. It carries not only illegal drugs; it also spurs illegal migration as families flee the chaos in search for a better life.\nThe people of South and Central America live with its consequences every day, and here in the United States, illegal drugs have poisoned our children, torn apart our families, and devastated too many communities.\nThe cancer of crime, corruption, and drugs will continue to stifle Latin America's progress as long as it exists. But as I saw on my trip, the nations and the people of the region are committed to action. And even now governments across the region are taking important steps to protect their people and provide them with real opportunities that will benefit the security of us all. (Applause.)\nAnd let me assure you, the United States is firmly committed to Latin America's security. And working with our allies in the region, we'll confront and overcome all who dare to threaten our well-being, and together, we will bring about a new era of safety and security for our people and all who call our hemisphere home.\nAs I told each of these leaders I met with last week, under President Donald Trump, the United States will continue to take decisive steps to address our nation's demand for illegal drugs. We'll continue to strengthen our borders, step up internal enforcement, and renew our effort to remove dangerous criminals, gang members, and drug dealers off the streets of America. (Applause.)\nAnd to protect the people of the United States, we'll also continue to work with all the nations across our region to combat drug production and transnational criminal syndicates. We'll support efforts to strengthen judicial systems to deal with traffickers more effectively.\nMy friends, my trip to Latin America strengthened my confidence that our future is bright. But it also convinced me that our future could and should be brighter still if every nation in the Western Hemisphere fully shared our heritage of freedom.\nThe past half-century has seen so much of Latin America follow down the road to freedom and progress. Yet as we speak, Venezuela has gone in the opposite direction toward dictatorship, not democracy; toward oppression, not freedom; toward the past, not the future.\nAs everyone here knows all too well, in Venezuela we are seeing the tragedy of tyranny play out before our very eyes.\nJust last week, in Cartagena, Colombia, my wife, Karen, and I met with brave Venezuelans who had fled the horrors of their homeland. At Calvary Chapel there, we breathed a prayer with them, and we listened to the heartbreaking stories of families.\nI spoke to a grandmother who had just rescued her grandchildren from Venezuela a week earlier. She told me with tears in her eyes how the children would have to rise at 4:00 in the morning in Venezuela in her hometown just to get a ticket that they could wait all day to use to buy one piece of bread.\nEveryone we talked to told us the same heartbreaking story of grinding poverty, families unable to find the food and medicine they need, and innocent children who are literally perishing every day from starvation and deprivation.\nThis is not the fate the Venezuelan people would have chosen for themselves. No free people has ever chosen to walk the path from prosperity to poverty. No free people has ever chosen to turn what was once and still should be one of South America's richest countries into its poorest and most corrupt.\nBut such is the plight of the Venezuelan people today. They've been brought to this point by the brutality and the barbarism of the Maduro regime.\nJust a few moments ago, I spoke with some of those who are here today who've either suffered themselves or seen their families suffer at the hands of the Maduro regime.\nI met with Daniela Schadendorf, whose stepfather, Antonio Ledezma, the mayor of Caracas, was thrown into prison just a few weeks ago for courageously opposing Maduro's regime to undermine democracy. (Applause.)\nI spoke with Alejandro Rebolledo and Antonio Marval Jimenez, two Venezuelan judges who've been driven into exile for supporting the rule of law, and others who've fled their homeland and faced detainment for their beliefs.\nWould those who I met with today mind standing briefly? Would you join me in thanking these heroes of freedom in Venezuela who have sacrificed much but will continue to fight for freedom in their homeland? (Applause.)\nThe stories will never leave me. I listened to the tragic story of Maria Eugenia Tovar, who brought a picture of her daughter, Genesis Carmona, who was murdered by the Maduro regime.\nThis mother grieves for her every day. And all of us who cherish freedom grieve with you, Maria. (Applause.) We grieve for the more than 130 brave Venezuelans who died in the fight to restore democracy in their homeland -- these men and women are heroes. They are martyrs in the cause of freedom, and we will never forget them. (Applause.)\nThe Venezuelan people are suffering every day. But as I told the men and women I met with today, they can know with confidence that under President Donald Trump, we hear you, we stand with you. (Applause.)\nAnd as the President said we \"will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\" (Applause.)\nThe United States will continue to stand with free nations across the hemisphere until democracy is restored for the Venezuelan people.\nAllow me to take a moment to thank Governor Rick Scott for his strong leadership for the people of Venezuela and the actions that he took just last week here in Florida. (Applause.)\nAnd let me also thank Senator Marco Rubio for being such a -- and eloquent champion for freedom in our hemisphere and around the world. (Applause.)\nAs I saw firsthand on my trip, Latin America is essentially united in condemning the Maduro regime and calling for the restoration of democracy for the Venezuelan people. But there's more work to be done.\nCountry after country has taken concrete steps to isolate and punish the Maduro regime. The four members of Mercosur unanimously voted to suspend Venezuela from their trade organization.\nAnd no fewer than 12 nations from across the Western Hemisphere joined together to sign the Lima Declaration, sending a powerful message that the free peoples of the Americas will stand with the Venezuelan people and stand up to their oppressors. (Applause.)\nAnd just yesterday, Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela announced a new policy in support of our efforts to require Venezuelans to obtain a visa before entering Panama. This is a strong step by Panama to further isolate the Maduro regime for its brutal tactics to undermine democracy, by denying safe haven to its corrupt and criminal inner circle.\nThe President and I are grateful for Latin America's strong stand for liberty, but we urge the countries of the region to do more -- much more. (Applause.)\nAnd you may be assured: Under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the United States of America will continue to bring the full measure of American economic and diplomatic power to bear until democracy is restored in Venezuela. (Applause.)\nAt President Trump's direction, the United States has already issued three rounds of targeted sanctions against Maduro and his inner circle. And there's more to come. (Applause.) And we'll continue to act until the Maduro regime holds free and fair elections, releases all political prisoners, and ends the repression of the Venezuelan people. (Applause.)\nOur resolve is unwavering; our conviction is clear. And while President Trump has said that \"we have many options for Venezuela,\" we remain confident that working together with all of our allies across Latin America we can achieve a peaceable solution to the crisis facing the Venezuelan people.\nWe do this because it's right. The birthright of the Venezuelan people has always been and will always be libertad! (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE: Libertad! Libertad! Libertad!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: We do this because, as President Trump has said, a \"stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of our entire hemisphere.\"\nWe share the same value. We share the same heritage of liberty. We share the same future. The collapse of Venezuela will affect us all.\nIt will drive more illegal drug trafficking, with its murderous criminal consequences radiating outward. The collapse of Venezuela into dictatorship will drive more illegal migration, corroding our borders, burdening our economies. And the collapse of Venezuela will ultimately endanger the well-being of all who call the Western Hemisphere home.\nWe cannot let that happen. We will not let that happen. (Applause.) Because them people of Venezuela are our brothers and sisters in liberty, their plight burns in our minds and in our hearts.\nWe all live in the same neighborhood. We succeed when our neighbors succeed. We struggle when our neighbors struggle, and so we will continue to act together with our partners and allies across this region in the fight for liberty for Venezuela. And I believe with all my heart that Venezuela will once again be free. (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE: Libertad! Libertad! Libertad!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: As Simon Bolivar himself declared for all the ages, \"A people that loves freedom will in the end be free.\" (Applause.)\nMy friends, freedom is the heritage and the legacy of all the peoples of this New World. In the long annals of liberty, names like Bolivar, San Martin, Marti stand with Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln.\nThey each held high the torch of freedom in their time. And now it has been passed to us, to carry, to keep lit in this hemisphere and to kindle to new brightness that it might illuminate and comfort all in its glow and inspire the world.\nThis, then, is our task, and under the leadership of President Donald Trump, I know we will succeed because I have faith. (Applause.) I have faith in the good peoples of Central and South America. I have faith in the timeless principles that bind us together. And I have faith in God -- (applause) -- whose word promised long ago that, \"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\" (Applause.)\nI felt that spirit as we prayed with those courageous Venezuelans in the Calvary Chapel just one week ago. In that moment I witnessed the power of faith to bring hope to the hopeless, to bring joy to the downtrodden. I saw men and women who by rights should be despairing but instead were confidently holding to the belief that there are better days for their families and their people.\nAnd as we stood holding hands and offering petitions from our hearts, I can only think of another promise, in that Old Book that reads: \"For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope, and a future.\"\nThe people of Venezuela have a hope, and the people of Venezuela have a future of freedom. (Applause.)\nSo I close with a prayer that God would bless all of you, many of whom are far from home but have never forgotten those who are struggling behind; a prayer for the American people who cherish and uphold freedom not just for ourselves but for all of our neighbors, and we inspire the world.\nMay God bless the people of Venezuela. May God bless the people Latin America. May God grant us the wisdom and the resolve to see our way to freedom in this New World and may God bless the United States of America.

SANDERS: I'll keep opening short today so we can jump straight into questions. Everybody knows I love a good birthday. Today is Stephen Miller's birthday. If you get a chance, be sure to tell him happy birthday. And if you have Jim Acosta's email, I'm sure Stephen would love to hear from him, so make sure you let him know it's his birthday so he can send him a note.\nQ: How old?\nMS. SANDERS: Twenty-five, I'm sure. (Laughter.)\nQ: I think I read 32.\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah, it's 32. But, I mean, I think everybody -- once you hit 30, you get to keep celebrating 29. I know that's what I've been doing for the last several years. I'm going to keep doing that for a while.\nQ: Here, here.\nMS. SANDERS: But anyway, we've had a great couple of days on the road, and with that I'll go ahead and take your questions and we'll jump right in.\nQ: Sarah, we had a chance to gaggle a little bit yesterday, but we didn't talk a whole lot since last Tuesday about just how the White House has reacted to the fallout from President Trump's remarks at Trump Tower. Can you tell us just a little bit about how people are feeling internally about that? There were some rumors that Gary Cohn was very upset and was considering leaving. Have you gotten any feedback from other advisors about how the President handled that last week?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think the President clarified a lot of that last night and had the opportunity to walk through each of the three times where he addressed both the media and the public, and has been very clear and very consistent since the beginning that the type of hate and evil that we saw has no place in America. He condemns that. He's done that time and time again, and he's going to continue to do that.\nBut at the same time, he's looking at ways that we can unify and break down some of the division that we think is taking place in our country. I think he strongly feels that a lot of that can be done through growing the economy, creating better jobs, and helping people have a better life.\nAnd that's certainly a big priority for this administration moving into the fall. Tax reform will be -- a tax relief, certainly for the middle class, is going to be a priority for the administration. It's something you'll see us put a lot of focus and emphasis on while we continue to look at the best ways to create a job-friendly environment and a strong economy.\nQ: So he joked a couple of times, both last night and today, about how his advisors had wanted him to rein it in a little bit -- be more \"presidential.\" Can you tell us a little bit about why that was that people within the White House were suggesting to him to take a different tone? I mean, he made it clear two times at least that he had been advised to do so.\nMS. SANDERS: I think you addressed that on the very front end of your question. He made a joke about it. Look, I don't think anybody in this administration came into it wanting to do anything but support and help this President and this President's agenda. And I think everybody who works for the President knows and understands that the reason that he is President is because he was himself, and the American people want somebody who is honest and authentic. And that's what they get with President Trump, and I don't think anybody in the administration feels differently.\nQ: Sarah, there were some reports earlier today that the White House was setting up meetings between the President and Mitch McConnell. Is that the case? Are there meetings? What will they talk about? And how would you characterize the relationship between the two?\nMS. SANDERS: Sure. You guys probably haven't seen it because I don't know if you have Internet, but we have a statement that's going out now, and also, Leader McConnell's office has put out a statement. I don't know if you guys saw that before you took off. I don't have his handy, but I'll make sure that you have it, and I'll bring a printout of this one so that you'll have it. But:\n\"President Donald J. Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell remain united on many shared priorities, including middle-class tax relief, strengthening the military, constructing a southern border wall, and other important issues.\nThey will hold previously scheduled meetings following the August recess to discuss these critical items with members of the congressional leadership and the President's Cabinet. White House and leadership staff are coordinating regarding the details of those meetings.\"\nSo, as you can see from this statement, there have been several conversations going on throughout the August recess about multiple meetings that will take place when everybody returns from August recess to discuss and set the agenda and the priorities for the fall agenda.\nI don't think that should come as a surprise to anybody. There have been quite a few ongoing conversations with the Leader's office, the White House, and members of the administration throughout August.\nQ: Where does healthcare fit into that?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that will certainly be part of the conversation. There's no question that Obamacare is still a disaster and there are still some things that need to be done, and we're going to continue to look for ways to fix the healthcare system. And I think there a lot of different options that may be on the table for that.\nQ: How do the various pieces fit together? Not just healthcare, but the President last night threatened a government shutdown over funding for the wall. The debt ceiling either has to be raised or has to be breached. All of these things -- funding the government -- all these things have to happen in, really, like four weeks, five weeks by the time people get back from recess. And Speaker Ryan today said he doesn't see a shutdown as necessary to achieve all the goals, but the President was threatening it specifically over the wall, which is not so much of a priority for some on the Hill. How does this all come together before we get to September 30th at 11:59?\nMS. SANDERS: Yeah. Specific to the border wall -- look, we're looking forward to working with Congress to get funding for the border wall. This was something the President campaigned on, he ran on it, and he won on it. And he's going to make sure that -- and has definite plans to make sure that it gets built. The border wall is a priority for the President. It's vital to security, the immigration system. And restoring law and order to the country's immigration system is one of the President's main priorities. This a big step in that direction.\nThe President has made no secret that this is a priority for him, and he continues to advocate for it and he'll continue to make sure that we move forward to secure the border and secure our country.\nQ: Was he serious when he said he would push the government to a shutdown in order to achieve that?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think the President is committed to making sure it happens, and he's also committed to working with Congress to make sure that we move forward. And as I think Speaker Ryan said, it's not necessary, so maybe that means he's onboard with making sure it happens.\nQ: And a follow to Jeff -- about being serious about the shutdown, was he also serious when he said that he didn't think that some journalists -- some in the press -- love this country?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think there are certainly some very real frustrations with the press, and certainly a lot of information out there that is not accurate that gets pushed to the American people. I think that's a real disservice to the American people. I think the job of reporters is to present facts and let people make up their own minds about where they stand on those issues. It's not for them to insert their own opinions and force those upon the American people. I think that's a problem. I think as much as we can avoid that, it's good for everybody.\nQ: Obviously you're the Press Secretary. Do you think what's happened since Charlottesville has irreparably damaged the President's relationship with the press?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't ever like to think that anything is irreparable. I certainly think that -- and the President pointed out last night -- that there are some good people within the press corps, but I do think that there are steps that need to be taken to make stories more accurate and to make sure that we're presenting the American people with the most -- the best information possible, and let them make up their mind on where they stand on particular issues.\nQ: Sarah, the President said last night that he views the press as the culprit for deepening division in the country and for sort of sowing some of these hateful thoughts. Can you elaborate a little bit? I mean, what specifically is he talking about that the press does that he thinks contributes to that process?\nMS. SANDERS: Certainly I think that some of that would be giving a platform to some of the divisiveness there and elevating it. There are a lot of problems that we have in this country that are completely ignored by the press, that aren't talked about, while others that certainly aren't issues of unity are relentlessly reported and driven and pushed and covered to the point where a lot of the big issues of our time are totally unknown.\nI mean, we have a lot of gang violence that's never reported, rarely talked about. Hundreds of people are dying in our country as a result of that, and that's something that just simply doesn't get covered a lot. And I think that's an issue that could be highlighted, and focusing on the law and order component versus, I think, issues where we give platforms to a lot of the evil people out there. We elevate a lot of -- oftentimes I think it's been seen when you have terrorism. By elevating those individuals it certainly, I think, encourages at times people who want to become famous by repeating those crimes and things like that. And I don't think that's helpful.\nQ: I was just going to ask, is the President going to go to any cities and talk about gang violence? I mean, he said the other day that he has plans to do more for urban cities than any previous President, but I don't believe he's made a major address on gang violence or any of those issues yet. Can you tell us what his plans are?\nMS. SANDERS: He certainly wants to make this a priority. He has talked pretty exclusively about the MS-13 gang violence, and he did an event in New York just maybe within the last month, I think it was, to highlight that and what we're doing to crack down on that. But I certainly think that you can always do more, and we'll keep you guys posted on scheduling for any event like that.\nQ: Is the White House drawing up paperwork for the President to pardon Sheriff Arpaio?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll keep you posted when we have an announcement and a decision on that front.\nQ: Sarah, the President's remarks on Saturday, after the Charlottesville riots, on Monday at the White House, and then on Tuesday at Trump Tower were all carried live by the networks. So his remarks were public and carried by the press. And he drew criticism not just from talking heads in the press, but also from members of his own party, as well as Democrats, as well as some world leaders. Does he acknowledge that?\nMS. SANDERS: I mean, does he hear that people were making critical remarks? Absolutely. But I also think that a lot of his remarks were mischaracterized in the following panels and everything else, basically calling the President a lot of things that he certainly isn't, and ignoring the fact that he had condemned these bad actors, he had condemned racism, he had called it evil. He called out the driver specifically. He condemns specific groups. And I think a lot of those comments had been ignored in some of the following -- just because they were covered in the 20-minute span of when he was talking. The other 23.5 hours of the day certainly didn't, I think, give a clear picture of the full comments that he had made at that time.\nQ: We really haven't had a chance since Monday night to talk about Afghanistan. The President said he wants an honorable and enduring result there. How long does he think that's going to take? And what does it look like for him at the end?\nMS. SANDERS: As the President said many times before, he's not going to set a timetable. He's looking at not repeating the mistakes of the previous administrations on this front, and going to rely heavily on the generals and the folks on the ground and the conditions to determine when the right time is to remove from Afghanistan.\nQ: Does the President, does the White House, does the administration feel responsibility to the American people, to military families, people in the military, to offer some kind of ballpark, some kind of idea of the magnitude of the number of troops who will be going into harm's way, and whether that's a rise -- a significant rise from current levels?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's important for the members of the military to be informed. And I think that as things move forward, that will take place. I think there was a reason that the President wanted to give that address and give those remarks in the location that he did. That was a decision that he made, that he wanted to do. And he wanted to speak directly to the troops and to all of the American people out of respect, because he understands the burden that he is asking them to take on, and that those are the people that will carry the water on this front. And so that was important for him to have the opportunity to speak directly to them about not only why, but what was happening in the process, and give them context into the decision that he made.\nQ: Sarah, he talked about the issue of economic development in Afghanistan, and he said that it could actually help to fray the cost of the American mission, but he didn't say how. Some people have speculated that the U.S. could actually invest in the mining industry and in extracting valuable minerals from Afghanistan. Is that what the President was getting at when he made that comment?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure about that. I have to check on that and get back to you.\nQ: Since Monday night, have any specific parts of his plan moved forward?\nMS. SANDERS: I know that the Department of Defense will be taking the primary lead on that, and they have stated that they are actively moving forward. But in terms of specifics, I would refer you to the Department of Defense to get more on that front.\nI'll take one more question.\nQ: A follow-up on Arpaio. You had told us yesterday that that issue would not be discussed. The President obviously did hint at it when he was at the rally. I know you don't want to talk about whether or not paperwork is being prepared, but can you comment on what he meant when he referred to that last night?\nMS. SANDERS: What I meant when I referred to it last night?\nQ: No, what President Trump meant when he was talking about the sheriff is going to be just fine.\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I think that he'll continue to make his plans clear when he's ready and at the appropriate time, and we'll certainly keep you guys posted on that. But I don't have anything else to add on that front today.\nQ: Actually, I have one more question. To go back to Leader McConnell, at the very beginning you were talking about this meeting and all that, but has the President seen the Times report in which the Leader specifically kind of -- at least through all this reporting -- seems to be saying that he's not sure that this President can get things done? Has the President seen that? What was his response? And in general, we've heard some jabs at some Senate Republicans from him in the last day. Is he worried that maybe taking this tough approach actually won't work with them?\nMS. SANDERS: The President -- again, I don't know if you guys have seen it, but Leader McConnell put out a statement and I'll try to make sure that we get you copies of that. I think it offers some clarity and mirrors a lot of what the statement I read to you earlier.\nIn terms of being tough with members of the Senate, I think everybody knows this President isn't somebody who backs down. And if he thinks that you need to lean in a little bit, he certainly will. And I don't think that's going to change at any point.\nThanks, guys. I'll make sure -- I'll try to get you guys copies of those statements so you'll have them.\nEND 6:23 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-08-23", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders"}

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128116", "text": "Secretary of Veterans Affairs Dr. David Shulkin: \"Today's appeals legislation was last updated in the 1930s. The President's signature today will help thousands of Veterans receive timely action on their appeals. We have to do better and get faster decisions for our Veterans.\"\nSenator Johnny Isakson (R-GA): \"For far too long, our veterans have faced unacceptable delays in their claims appeals. With this legislation, we're going to reduce the time it takes for our veterans to get a decision and increase the opportunity for them to receive their just benefits. I am pleased that this legislation moved quickly to reach the president's desk and to be signed into law.\"\nChairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Mike Bost (R-IL): \"This new law is vitally important for America's heroes and their families. Too many veterans are faced with intolerable delays during the VA's benefits claims appeal process. By modernizing the system, we can now ensure they get the help they need in a more efficient and effective manner. I thank my colleagues in Congress - both Republican and Democrat – for working together across the aisle to help our nation's heroes. I also want to thank President Trump for signing this legislation into law and prioritizing veterans' issues.\"\nChairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs Phil Roe (R-TN): \"For far too long, veterans with pending appeals on their disability claims have been stuck in an outdated and cumbersome process. In the last two fiscal years, the number of pending appeals increased almost 20 percent, meaning nearly half a million veterans are in limbo waiting for a decision on their appeal. This is absolutely unacceptable, which is why the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, led by Subcommittee Chairman Bost, came together to move legislation that will modernize the appeals process. In keeping with the committee's tradition of bipartisanship, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 was cosponsored by every single member of the committee. This new law will create three lanes for appeals claims which will undoubtedly speed up the appeals process and give veterans the certainty they deserve. I thank President Trump for signing this important legislation into law and commend my colleagues on the committee for their leadership on this bill, especially DAMA Subcommittee Chairman Bost and Subcommittee Ranking Member Esty.\"\nThe American Legion: \"Today's signing is a major victory for America's veterans. I can think of no better place for the president to sign this bill than at the national convention of America's largest and most influential veterans service organization. The legislation is a simple, fair and appropriate way to ensure that our nation's veterans — and their families — receive their earned benefits in a timely and efficient manner.\"\nParalyzed Veterans of America: \"The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Law represents a major step toward ensuring justice for the veterans, dependents and survivors who believe in their entitlement to a denied benefit. These people aren't asking for a handout; they simply want fairness and timely review when they file appeals. Paralyzed Veterans of America fights on behalf of the most catastrophically disabled veterans with the most complex claims in the system. Our unrivaled expertise is often challenged by a labyrinthine, protracted review process where a growing backlog, coupled with inconsistent and arbitrary decisions, hurt those who rate the benefits they're pursuing. For those appellants who choose to file without an accredited representative, it's nearly impossible to get a fair decision. We commend the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for hearing our concerns and working with us to preserve due process and develop new and improved standards. This new law is a culmination of those efforts. It is also a significant win for President Trump and VA Secretary Shulkin, both of whom are keeping their promise to veterans with the passage of this law.\"\nVeterans of Foreign Wars: \"Today's signing is the culmination of more than a year's work by the VFW and other partner organizations with Congress and the VA to build consensus on how to better help veterans access their benefits. Under the old system, appeals could take up to five years or longer to adjudicate, and veterans had no way out. Maintaining the status quo was unacceptable, so the VFW and our partners acted with a unified voice. As a former veterans' service officer myself, I know first-hand that many of the veterans the VFW helps every day to access their earned benefits will be better served under this new framework. We look forward to working with the Department of Veterans Affairs to make sure this new framework results in timely, understandable and accurate benefits decisions for veterans. Ending sequestration and fixing the VA are the VFW's top two legislative initiatives. The passage of all three bills are great leaps toward fixing the VA and restoring the faith of veterans in their VA — all thanks to a united Congress and a new president who vowed during the campaign trail that he would take care of veterans, service members and their families, and who has so far been true in both word and deed.\"\nDisabled American Veterans: \"For far too long, veterans have faced unnecessary and unacceptable delays within the current VA disability appeals system, on average taking between three to five years—sometimes longer—to complete. Passage of the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 into law today marks an important step forward in creating a more timely and accurate system for processing veterans' appeals.\"\nIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America: \"Today, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the leading voice of the Post-9/11 generation of veterans, applauded the President's signing of the VA Appeals Modernization Act of 2017 (H.R. 2288) into law. This long awaited improvement to the appeals system will make the process more efficient and help prevent a VA claims backlog, which for years forced veterans to delay critical health care or pay for care themselves, causing financial distress.\"\nHouse Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rogers (R-WA): \"The VA has one mission: to serve our veterans. Part of rolling out the red carpet for our heroes is ensuring that they don't get caught in a benefits claims backlog. With thousands of veterans waiting for decisions, the reforms in Rep. Bost and Sen. Isakson's bill are long overdue and much-needed. Thanks to their hard work and President Trump's continued commitment to our veterans, the VA will soon be one step closer to being reconnected with its mission.\"\nRep. Dina Titus (D-NV): \"Having led the effort to reform the VA appeals process for more than four years, I am pleased that this legislation I introduced last year will finally become law. To develop this new system, I held hearings and convened a working group consisting of the VA, VSOs, and other experts to modernize a process that has not been updated since the 1980s. What the president signed today is a result of hard work, collaboration, cooperation, and creativity to fix a snarled system that will improve the lives of veterans. Now we must work to ensure that it is quickly and carefully implemented by the VA and the VSOs.\"\nRep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND): \"Our veterans deserve the same access and quality of care that everyone else receives in this country. Unfortunately, with the massive backlog of appeals at the VA, they are not receiving the care we promised them. With President Trump's signing the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act today, the half million veterans who are still waiting for a resolution regarding their VA benefits will finally get a response in a timely manner. I applaud the President for making this a priority.\"", "timestamp": "2017-08-24", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying: Praise for President Donald J.

{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128117", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n2:57 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. It's good to be back. You guys don't seem nearly as excited. I thought for sure there'd be balloons or something. We'll save that for next time, I guess.\nEarlier this week, the President delivered his first prime time address to the nation on our path forward in Afghanistan and South Asia. The President's strategy is based on conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables. And it will ensure terrorists never again use Afghanistan as a haven to attack the United States.\nThe brave men and women of our nation's military have given extraordinary sacrifices to this longest war in American history.\nThe President recognized those sacrifices on Monday during his speech, and I would like to recognize one particular story here today.\nJoseph, a gentleman from Santa Fe, Tennessee, sent his son, a master sergeant in the United States Air Force, a letter nearly 10 years ago while he was serving our country in Iraq.\nNow his son is on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan, and his father has generously shared the letter and mailed it to the President that he wrote.\nJoseph told the President that he has been a police officer for over 30 years and that he sent this letter to his son and on to the White House in hopes that the President would actually receive it and read it, which I'm glad to say that he did earlier today.\nIn his letter to his son, Joseph wrote:\n\"Please don't lose sight of your purpose. You are the only hope and glimmer of light for the good, innocent men, women, and children that you are protecting. This may be hard for you to see or understand. Most people know that all of you are there because you volunteered to be there. Your actions and dedication are seen by people throughout the world as without a doubt the most heroic action of any person which can be made.\nYou and the soldiers standing next to you from all of the other countries are the pride of not only the nations they represent but every individual that yearns to be free.\nStand tall, my son, and be steadfast for it is you who are the defender of freedom.\"\nWe owe it to the servicemen and women like the master sergeant who have fought in our name in Afghanistan for 17 years -- and to the families who have watched them go -- to secure an honorable and lasting outcome to this conflict.\nAs the President said on Monday, \"The men and women who serve our nation in combat deserve a plan for victory. And once that victory has been achieved, they also deserve to return home to a country that honors their sacrifices and provides our nation's heroes with the support they've earned by risking their lives to ensure the freedoms of all Americans.\"\nThat's why the President was also honored to sign yet another historic piece of legislation to support our veterans earlier this week. The VA Choice Act streamlines the lengthy process of appealing claims for disability benefits for the more than 470,000 veterans that are still waiting for decisions.\nUnder the leadership of Secretary Shulkin, the VA is steadily delivering on the President's promise to fix the broken VA system.\nFinally, before I'd open it up to take your questions, as you're all very well aware, I kind of love birthdays around here. And oddly, we have quite a few of them going on. Major Garrett, happy birthday. But even more importantly, I'm pretty lucky -- I think I have two of the best parents in the world, and it's my dad's birthday. So happy birthday, Dad. And it's my niece's birthday, so I get to knock out a ton of stuff today. My only niece, Caroline, turned four today.\nAnd with that, I will take your questions. Steve.\nQ: Sarah, there seems to be some acrimony between the President and the Republican congressional leadership. How do you repair this relationship going into the fall?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think the relationships are fine. Certainly there are going to be some policy differences, but there are also a lot of shared goals. And that's what we're focused on.\nWe're disappointed that Obamacare -- they failed to get it repealed and replaced. But at the same time, President Trump has worked with Leader McConnell to reach out to other members and to work on those shared goals, and we're going to continue to do that when the Senate comes back from recess.\nQ: Will the President sign any budget bill that does not include funding for the wall?\nMS. SANDERS: The President has talked pretty extensively about this. He campaigned on the wall, he won on talking about building the wall, and he's going to make sure that that gets done. And he'll continue to fight for that funding and ensure that it takes place.\nLet's not forget that there were a lot of Democrat senators that also voted for border security and a border fence. And hopefully some of those same individuals will talk to members in their current party, and maybe we can get a bipartisan group to support that and make sure it happens because this President is going to see it through.\nJohn.\nQ: Sarah, it's my older daughter's birthday, by the way too.\nMS. SANDERS: Good, we'll go ahead and cover that one too. (Laughter.)\nQ: It's my understanding that when the President meets with Senator McConnell the beginning of September when Congress is back that he will ask him to take another swing at repealing Obamacare. At the same time, a judge in New Jersey, Judge Walls, has said that Senator Robert Menendez cannot come back to the Senate to cast votes. How does that, in combination with what the President might want the Senate Majority Leader to do on Obamacare factor into the balance of power and the vote count you need to get a repeal bill through?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure about the specifics of that case. I know there's still ongoing judicial process taking place, so I'm not going to get into that. But I can tell you that the President continues to be committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare and making sure that America has good healthcare and the healthcare that they deserve.\nQ: But given what happened just before the August recess, does he really have a chance of getting it through?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, we're committed to continuing to make sure that we have the best healthcare we can. And if we can do that in that direction, I think that's great. If we can't, we need to look for other ways that we can make solutions.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Sarah. Hurricane Harvey appears to be bearing down on the southern part of the U.S.; specifically Texas seems to be in its crosshairs there. There's no replacement yet for General Kelly at the Department of Homeland Security. First question, does the President plan to name a replacement for him anytime soon? And second of all, is this problematic in terms of dealing with Hurricane Harvey -- the fact that there's no one at the helm right now at DHS?\nMS. SANDERS: No. There's certainly someone at the helm. You've got Acting Secretary Elaine Duke, who's watching this closely -- very involved in the process along with the Acting Director for FEMA.\nAnd again, I think that we are in great shape having General Kelly sitting next to the President throughout this process -- and probably no better Chief of Staff for the President during the hurricane season. And the President has been briefed and will continue to be updated as the storm progresses and certainly something he's very aware of, and we'll keep a very watchful eye on, and stands ready to provide resources if needed.\nQ: Sarah, the President promised over and over again during the campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall. So why is he now threatening a government shutdown if Congress won't pay for it?\nMS. SANDERS: The President is committed to making sure this gets done. We know that the wall and other security measures at the border work. We've seen that take place over the last decade, and we're committed to making sure the American people are protected. And we're going to continue to push forward and make sure that the wall gets built.\nMatthew.\nQ: Why is he threatening a shutdown over paying for it? Again, he said over and over again -- he talked about it in the campaign over and over again. He said Mexico is going to pay for the wall. He asked people and his crowds chanted back at him, Mexico is going to pay for it. And now he's pushing -- threatening a shutdown of the government.\nMS. SANDERS: Once again, the President is committed to making sure this happens, and we're going to push forward.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. About a week ago, on August 17th, the President again referenced a fictitious story about General Pershing committing a mass execution in the Philippines. A couple of questions on that. Does the President know that this story is false? And if so, why does he keep repeating it? And why does the White House think it's appropriate for the President to perpetuate this false story if he hasn't been informed that it's not true?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had a chance to ask him about that so I can't speak to it.\nQ: Then on the broader point, so the President is spreading false information via his Twitter account that seems to encourage wartime atrocities. No one in the White House has thought to inform him that this story is false?\nMS. SANDERS: I didn't say no one had. I said I hadn't had that conversation so I wasn't going to speak to something I wasn't aware of.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Thank you. The U.S. has withheld funding to Egypt over its human rights record. President Trump praised President Sisi back in April when he was here. Why the change in tone now?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the United States has always been committed on human rights issues, and we'll continue to do that. And if I have further updates, I'll let you know. But I'd encourage you to reach out to the State Department.\nApril.\nQ: Sarah, two questions. On the economics of a government shutdown if the wall is not paid for, the President likes to talk about how the economy is doing well under his watch. If there is a government shutdown, people could be laid off for a moment or some people could lose their jobs. Talk to us about the economics. What does he view the economics of it with this wall for the average American that he's fighting for?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get into the weeds on that, but I know that the President is probably one of the strongest Presidents we've had on economic issues. There's a reason that over a million jobs have been created since he took office. There's a reason that the unemployment is at a 16-year low. There's a reason that the stock market is at an all-time high. He's very committed to job creation, economic growth, and he's going to continue to do that.\nQ: And then with the HBCU Summit, there is a big back-and-forth about this HBCU Summit. Three of the organizations that are over top of the HBCUs -- that basically represent them -- are saying this is not the time to have this summit because of Charlottesville and the fact that some of the schools feel that they just did not get what was promised from this administration and there could be an alternate summit by a congresswoman. Talk to me. What's going on here --\nMS. SANDERS: Look, the HBCU Summit has been going on for over 30 years. We have no intention of canceling it. And as of right now, the summit is at complete capacity with a waiting list. With that type of engagement, I think it's best that we move forward.\nQ: Can I see the list of schools and the names? Because we're hearing from schools that are saying that they are not coming -- and a lot of leaders.\nMS. SANDERS: I can only tell you who's registered and certainly that we're at capacity for the convention center with a pretty lengthy waiting list. In terms of whether or not we release that, I'd have to check on that and get back to you.\nQ: Sarah, what are the President's thoughts on the situation in Cuba at the U.S. embassy? We understand now as many as 19 Americans have been injured.\nMS. SANDERS: I know that they have been going through the process of bringing the majority of those people back to have thorough testing and see what actions need to be taken and how best to move forward.\nAt this point, I'd refer you to the State Department on anything further.\nQ: Does the President believe that Cuba is involved directly?\nMS. SANDERS: I can't comment on that at this time. Right now we're under a thorough review, and as soon as we know something we'll let you know.\nEamon.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. This morning, the President said that the debt-ceiling approval process is a mess. Is it? Is that accurate?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, it's our job to inform Congress of the debt ceiling, and it's their job to raise it. And Congress and the previous administration have obligated trillions in spending, and we need to make sure we pay our debts. We're still committed to making sure that gets raised.\nQ: So, Sarah, does he want a clean debt-ceiling bill?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes.\nQ: Does he want it to be clean? Yes.\nMS. SANDERS: Yes.\nQ: I was just going to ask a follow-up question about that. The health attacks -- as the Secretary of State has deemed them -- has the President been informed of this? Has he been briefed?\nMS. SANDERS: He's been briefed. But again, I think there's a thorough review taking place. And at this point, I'd have to refer you to the State Department for any further follow up.\nTolu.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. I'm going to try a business question for you.\nMS. SANDERS: Uh-oh.\nQ: Does the White House have any reaction to the FTC approving the acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of that. I'd have to check and see if there's an official administration response.\nQ: And second question, I want to read the comments from Senator Bob Corker -- I'm sure you've seen them -- over a week ago about the President saying that the President has not yet \"been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.\" He also said that he's not sure that the President understands the character of this nation. Do you have any response to that from a Republican senator?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that's a ridiculous and outrageous claim and doesn't dignify a response from this podium.\nMajor.\nQ: Just to follow up on Jonathan's question, since the President is going full-court press, threatening a shutdown over the funding of the wall, does that mean he is abandoning any efforts to negotiate with Mexico any payments for construction of the wall?\nMS. SANDERS: I certainly don't think any efforts have been abandoned. And an official happy birthday.\nQ: So wait, hold on, one second. You mentioned in the opening remarks \"honorable\" and \"victory,\" as the President did, in Afghanistan. Can you describe to the American people what both of those words mean for the President -- honorable and victory? What does it look like? What will the -- what does that mean?\nMS. SANDERS: I think when he spoke on Monday he laid out what the top priority was in this process, and that's making Americans safe and protecting the American people and moving forward with this strategy and making sure that Afghanistan is never able to be used as a haven to attack the United States.\nI think those are certainly clear goals and part of that process.\nQ: Does that mean, therefore, that U.S. military personnel will be there as long as there is any type of terrorist activity or cell in Afghanistan or Pakistan?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think when it comes to the strategy in Afghanistan, they're going to be focused on the conditions on the ground, which will be determined by the generals in the military on the ground and certainly through the Department of Defense and General Mattis and his team, and not arbitrary timetables. And he'll be the one that can lay out those specifics for you and what that looks like.\nQ: I'm just asking because you've mentioned terrorism. You mentioned threats. There are several different networks there -- Haqqani, Taliban, al Qaeda, ISIS. Is the priority of this administration and the strategy that it will pursue until it is accomplished to eliminate all of those terrorist cells in either Afghanistan and Pakistan and only then can victory be achieved and that be described as honorable?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not going to get down into that. I think that's a question that's, again, best answered by General Mattis and the Department of Defense.\nWhat I can tell you is that the ultimate goal is a peaceful settlement between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban that protects our interest and protects American lives. That's the focus, and I'll let Secretary Mattis determine and lay that out for you more specifically.\nQ: Sarah, I've got a follow-up on Major of Afghanistan. So first of all, if what we've been doing in Afghanistan has been working, then why are we still here? And if it hasn't been working, what are we planning to be doing differently moving forward?\nMS. SANDERS: I think -- again, one of the things that is different is the decision and whether or not when and how to withdrawal would be based on conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables; making sure that we have an integrated strategy that puts all of our American power -- diplomatic, economic, and military -- in a way that's sustainable and cost-effective. And making sure we have that integrated process is a big key to this strategy.\nQ: Adding troops is just prolonging the withdrawal. Is that what that is?\nMS. SANDERS: No. Again, we're not doing this based on a timetable but conditions on the ground and making sure that we're protecting American lives and defeating terrorists.\nI think that it's very clear when the President laid that out on Monday.\nQ: And my second question -- hold on, wait, I had a second question on that. Whatever the final objective is, is it really worth the reported trillion dollars that it would cost? Isn't there anything better we might be able to spend that on?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think you can put a price tag on American lives.\nQ: Sarah, one more question on Afghanistan. The President talked about putting more pressure on Pakistan to play a constructive role. But he also talked about having a new, closer strategic partnership with India, which is Pakistan's prime antagonist. Why does the President think drawing closer to India will prompt the Pakistanis to play a more constructive role rather than becoming more defensive and playing more into a strategy of giving harbor to extremists?\nMS. SANDERS: Well, we think it's important that there's a regional approach, and part of that is developing and strengthening that relationship and partnership with India. They've been making important contributions towards Afghanistan's democracy and their stability, and we think it's important to continue that effort.\nCecilia.\nQ: Sarah, on this threat of the government shutdown if Congress doesn't secure funding for this wall, how is that not a concession from this White House that Mexico isn't actually going to pay for this wall and American taxpayers will?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, this is something the President is committed to. He's committed to protecting American lives. And doing that through the border wall is something that's important. It's a priority, and we're moving forward with it.\nNoah.\nQ: But he's not saying that Mexico is going to pay for it now.\nMS. SANDERS: He hasn't said they're not either.\nNoah.\nQ: On the --\nQ: They have. They have.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you. I think we've had enough outbursts from that side. Thanks.\nQ: On the President's ban on transgender service in the military, how close is the White House to sending guidance to the Pentagon on that? And the policy itself, how much discretion will be given to the Pentagon on implementing it?\nMS. SANDERS: When we have an announcement on that, I'll let you know, and we'll be sure to answer those questions at that time.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Two questions, please. First, the beginning of May with great fanfare, the President signed a string of religious liberty executive orders. In the last few days, the head of the Becket Fund -- a group that fights for religious liberty in court -- complained that that the executive order, even with the Johnson amendment, the tax-exempt status for churches, whether they deal in politics, and the Affordable Care Act's contraception clause were both still being enforced in spite of the President's orders that they not be. What is the President doing about this? And is he aware of these complaints?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure if he's aware of the complaints or any specific places where that's being ignored, so I'd have to look into that, probably talk to our friends at HHS specific to the contraception thing, and get back to you.\nQ: All right. And my second question is: In Russia the major story there is that the theater director Kirill Serebrennikov, who is a well-known figure in the Russian entertainment industry and an opponent of the Putin regime, has been arrested and is being tried on what he said are trumped up charges regarding his finances. There are massive demonstrations beginning. Does the administration have a comment on what's happened to Mr. Serebrennikov?\nMS. SANDERS: I certainly can't make an official statement at this time, but I'll circle back with you.\nFred. Sorry, Fred.\nQ: Sarah.\nMS. SANDERS: Sorry, you're over there. Thought I saw you in the back.\nQ: Yes, two questions. One, given the rift with the President and Republican leaders in Congress, is there an elevated role right now for Vice President Pence -- having been in Congress or kind of speaking both languages -- in terms of working with Congress going into negotiating the budget and so forth?\nMS. SANDERS: The Vice President plays a key and pivotal role in the administration and the White House. I think he's certainly always going to be an important part of the process of moving legislation forward on whatever that circumstance is or whatever the matter is. He is probably one of the best advocates here at the White House and certainly somebody that the President has a great deal of trust in and is happy to have him on his team.\nQ: I got one more question. Is that role elevated though considering that there seems to be a rift between the White House and Congress?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the Vice President is the second-in-command, so it's a pretty high role where he is. And certainly, again, a key member of this administration and somebody who plays a pivotal role every single day in the White House no matter what the circumstances are.\nGo ahead.\nQ: One more topic. And then, Sarah -- there has been some increased criticism from conservatives about Commissioner Koskinen at IRS after an IG report came out that highlighted that there were 213 employees that were rehired after committing offenses, including some crimes -- for termination. And I was wondering if you could revisit why Commissioner Koskinen is still part of the administration and if the President has any plans put in place to replace him when his term is up in November.\nMS. SANDERS: When we have a personnel announcement on that front I'll certainly let you know.\nGo ahead.\nQ: Two questions on pardons, if I could. One on Sheriff Arpaio. Is the President seeking a recommendation from the pardon attorney and the deputy attorney general, or is he asking for an FBI background check in his consideration of that pardon?\nMS. SANDERS: I would imagine they go through the thorough and standard process, and when we have an announcement on what that decision is after that's completed, we'll let you know.\nQ: And more broadly, beyond Arpaio, there are 2,200 other pardon applications pending. Does the President have any pardon policy, pardon philosophy, any particular way that he would like to use his pardon power during his term in office?\nMS. SANDERS: I haven't had a specific conversation with him about that, but I know that the White House counsel plays a big role in that and would certainly be involved in that process and any deliberations on that.\nAlexis.\nQ: Sarah, the President has made clear that -- in the past that he wanted to get started on tax reform, but we haven't heard him say that much about it. Politico talked to a White House correspondent and published this week that the President has an imminent announcement about tax reform. Can you describe how he wants to kick off the fall campaign to get that accomplished this year? And are we going to hear from him this week, next week, what would you expect?\nMS. SANDERS: Tax relief and the focus on tax relief for middle-class Americans is a huge priority for this administration and it's certainly going to be a big focus in the fall. And we're going to look a lot of different ways in which to talk about that and present that to the American people, working with Congress to make sure that that happens. And we'll keep you guys posted when there are specific announcements. I think that you can expect some of that to take place in the very short order, probably next week and following through to the fall.\nQ: Then, Sarah -- it's customary for Presidents to get annual physicals -- physical exams at Walter Reed. The President -- I think he last released information about his medical condition last fall during the campaign. Can you tell us whether the President intends to utilize the federal facilities at Walter Reed this year to get a physical and then release that information to the public?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll let you know if that's going to happen.\nTrey.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. On Tuesday, President Trump said \"if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.\" Does he stand by that statement?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think the President has been clear that this is a priority -- protecting American citizens is a priority, something he's committed to. As I've said multiple times today, he's committed to seeing that through.\nQ: Is there a plan to force a government shutdown to get the wall built?\nMS. SANDERS: I think I've answered this question several times.\nZeke.\nQ: Two questions for you. First, the President at the rally in Phoenix mentioned that he seemed inclined to be pulling the U.S. out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. His comments came after the first round of NAFTA renegotiation talks last week. So were those comments informed by the status of those negotiations last week here in Washington when he said -- that was his prediction that he was going to be pulling the U.S. out?\nMS. SANDERS: The President is being kept up to date on those negotiations. I think he has certainly been clear about how he feels about NAFTA and making sure that we get the best deal for the American people. He's committed to that. We'll see how the negotiations go and then go from there.\nThanks so much guys.\nEND 3:22 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-08-24", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders"}

Trump has signed an Executive Order imposing strong, new financial sanctions on the dictatorship in Venezuela.\nThe Maduro dictatorship continues to deprive the Venezuelan people of food and medicine, imprison the democratically-elected opposition, and violently suppress freedom of speech. The regime's decision to create an illegitimate Constituent Assembly—and most recently to have that body usurp the powers of the democratically-elected National Assembly—represents a fundamental break in Venezuela's legitimate constitutional order.\nIn an effort to preserve itself, the Maduro dictatorship rewards and enriches corrupt officials in the government's security apparatus by burdening future generations of Venezuelans with massively expensive debts. Maduro's economic mismanagement and rampant plundering of his nation's assets have taken Venezuela ever closer to default. His officials are now resorting to opaque financing schemes and liquidating the country's assets at fire sale prices.\nAs Vice President Mike Pence has said, in Venezuela, \"we're seeing the tragedy of tyranny play out before our eyes.\" No free people has ever chosen to walk the path from prosperity to poverty. No free people has ever chosen to turn what was once, and should still be, one of South America's richest nations into its poorest and most corrupt.\nWe will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles. The President's new action prohibits dealings in new debt and equity issued by the government of Venezuela and its state oil company. It also prohibits dealings in certain existing bonds owned by the Venezuelan public sector, as well as dividend payments to the government of Venezuela.\nTo mitigate harm to the American and Venezuelan people, the Treasury Department is issuing general licenses that allow for transactions that would otherwise be prohibited by the Executive Order. These include provisions allowing for a 30-day wind-down period; financing for most commercial trade, including the export and import of petroleum; transactions only involving Citgo; dealings in select existing Venezuelan debts; and the financing for humanitarian goods to Venezuela.\nThese measures are carefully calibrated to deny the Maduro dictatorship a critical source of financing to maintain its illegitimate rule, protect the United States financial system from complicity in Venezuela's corruption and in the impoverishment of the Venezuelan people, and allow for humanitarian assistance.\nThe United States is not alone in condemning the Maduro regime. Through the Lima Declaration of August 8, our friends and partners in the region refused to recognize the illegitimate Constituent Assembly or the laws it adopts. The new United States financial sanctions support this regional posture of economically isolating the Maduro dictatorship.\nThe United States reiterates our call that Venezuela restore democracy, hold free and fair elections, release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally, and end the repression of the Venezuelan people. We continue to stand with the people of Venezuela during these trying times.", "timestamp": "2017-08-25", "title": "Statement by the Press Secretary on New Financial Sanctions on Venezuela"}

SANDERS: Good afternoon, everybody. I hope you don't mind, I brought a few friends today. We've got a lot to get through so I'm going to keep it short on the front end, and then of course I'll be back up to take your questions.\nFirst, I'd like to invite Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin and National Security Adviser General H.R. McMaster up to discuss the new financial sanctions on the dictatorship in Venezuela that the President imposed today. They'll each deliver brief opening remarks and take your questions on that topic.\nAfter that, Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert will be up to give an update and take your questions on preparations for Hurricane Harvey. The administration has been closely monitoring the situation, and we want to make sure the American people are fully briefed on this important news of the day.\nAnd finally, after all the three of them wrap up, I'll be back up here to take a few of your questions on other topics.\nThanks.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Good afternoon, everybody. As you've seen, the President signed a new executive order that strongly punishes the Venezuelan regime. This order demonstrates more clearly than ever that the United States will not allow an illegitimate dictatorship to take hold in the Western Hemisphere at the expense of its people.\nThrough the President's strong action, the United States will target the means with which the Maduro dictatorship can accumulate debt to enrich its corrupt regime insiders and perpetuate its repressive behavior.\nOnly six weeks ago, several million Venezuelans voted overwhelmingly against the Maduro regime's plans to convene a constituent assembly that the people of Venezuela never requested. The United States and the regional community stood in solidarity with the Venezuelan people and demanded that their voices be heard.\nBut Maduro chose to embrace dictatorship over his own people. As a result, a dozen of Venezuela's neighbors gathered in Lima, Peru, and rejected Maduro's actions.\nPresident Trump promised strong action if Maduro moved ahead and ignored his people's will. With today's announcement, the President is keeping his promise of strong action and continuing to show strong leadership.\nThis executive order does not need to be permanent. The President has said that \"a stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of the entire hemisphere.\"\nWe will continue to work with our friends and partners in the international community to support the Venezuelan people until their rights and democracy are fully restored.\nNow I'll turn it over to Secretary Mnuchin to describe this executive order in greater detail.\nMr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you. Today's executive order demonstrates the U.S. government's condemnation of tyranny and dictatorship in Venezuela. The Maduro regime has consistently shown hostility to the rule of law, democratic institutions, and the Venezuelan people.\nThis has been a catastrophe for the country. Nicolas Maduro has financed his regime by hollowing out Venezuela through economic mismanagement, corruption, and the assumption of onerous debt.\nLet me be clear: Today's action is focused on restricting the regime's access to American debt and equity markets. Maduro may no longer take advantage of the American financial system to facilitate the wholesale looting of the Venezuelan economy at the expense of the Venezuelan people.\nThese measures will also undermine Maduro's ability to pay off political cronies and regime supporters, and increase pressure on the regime to abandon its disastrous path.\nUnder the executive order, U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in specified dealings involving the government of Venezuela and its instrumentalities. This includes state-owned oil company PDVSA. These prohibitions extend to transactions or activities occurring in the United States and cover both debt and equity instruments.\nIn an effort to minimize the undue harm to the American and Venezuelan people and global markets, we are issuing general licenses permitting transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under the executive order. These include a 30-day wind-down period, the financing for humanitarian goods to Venezuela, and certain dealings in specified debt instruments that trade on secondary markets, and certain dealings with U.S. entities owned or controlled by the government of Venezuela.\nAlso, the executive order carves out short-term financing for most commercial trade, including the export and import of petroleum.\nThis executive order builds on a number of actions taken by the U.S. government to prevent the flow of funds to Maduro's regime. On my first day in office, I was here with you at this podium where the Treasury Department designated the Venezuelan vice president under the Kingpin Act. And this year alone, we have sanctioned 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself.\nWe urge those within the regime, including those who have been sanctioned, to distance themselves from the violence and the dictatorship. President Trump made it clear the status quo is unacceptable. Today's actions is the next step towards freedom for the Venezuelan people. We will continue working to achieve this goal with allies around the world who have widely condemned Venezuela's dictatorship.\nAnd with that I'd be happy to take some questions.\nQ: Could you describe the carve-outs for debt trading on secondary markets? And do you have a sense of exactly how long those carve-outs would last and what they consist of specifically?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: So there will be a general license that carves out specific debt instruments that we know are held by U.S. entities. So we want to make sure that U.S. pensions or U.S. fiduciaries are not hurt by this, and if they want to sell their bonds they can do so. But this will limit any new investments.\nQ: Thank you very much. I have one question for both of you. General McMaster, the President had indicated that military action was on the table. Is that still the case, given this new round of sanctions? And can you talk about potential concerns about the impact this could have on the broader region and the economic crisis that has already in place?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I'll let the General comment first on military actions, and then I'll comment on that.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Well, the President directed us not just to develop plans for the current situation, but to anticipate the possibility of a further deterioration within Venezuela. As you know, the Venezuelan people are suffering tremendously -- suffering more and more every day as they see democracy distinguished and this autocratic regime put in place.\nAnd so the President said, if things get worse, how could they get worse, and what are a range of options available to him that we could take in concert, certainly, with our partners in the region.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: On the economic front, I would say our plan has to continue to hurt, turn up the heat on the Venezuelan government. And these specific actions we've tried to balance things that don't hurt the Venezuelan people, so we have made sure that humanitarian efforts are still allowed. We've also made sure that certain U.S. entities can continue to trade. But we view that this will have a significant impact, and in no way do we want the American economy and the American financial markets to continue to finance these activities.\nQ: Thank you, sir. This is a pretty strongly worded statement, and you describe President Maduro as a dictator who disregards the rule of law and things like that. I'll ask you again, because I asked you this last time you guys were up here on this subject: How is what's happening in Venezuela with President Maduro any different from the situations with dictators in Turkey, in the Philippines, and in Russia that also routinely step on the rule of law and ignore democratic norms? And yet President Trump and his administration can't seem to bring themselves to criticize them. Why is this dictator worse than all the other dictators?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, I think, as you know, on Russia we've taken very significant actions. And I say, we will look at every one of these on specific situations. And right now we are dealing with a terrible situation in Venezuela, and that's what we're here to address.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. You said recently that you're working with congressional leaders to push for a clean debt-ceiling hike, but the President said yesterday that he wants to attach VA reform to the debt ceiling. So I'm just curious whether you feel you're on the same page on that front.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Sure. Well, let me first assure you the President and I are completely on the same page, and we're speaking on a regular basis on this. We had a meeting with the President and the Vice President yesterday in the Oval Office.\nWhat the President said was that his strong preference had been that when they passed the VA bill before they left, that they attach the debt ceiling to that so that we wouldn't be dealing with this in September. And what I have said before, my strong preference is that we have a clean debt ceiling, but the most important issue is the debt ceiling will be raised in September.\nI've had discussions with the leaders in both parties, in the House and Senate, and we are all on the same page. The government intends to pay its debts, and the debt ceiling will be raised.\nQ: General McMaster, just to clarify on the question of options for the President that's asked of you. When the Vice President was in the region, almost every nation he went to expressed reservations about U.S. military involvement in Venezuela. Will that be enough to dissuade the President from taking any military action? And if military action is contemplated, what is the national security implication to the United States of the situation in Venezuela?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: I would just say the Vice President had a very successful trip through Latin America, and I don't think that there's ever been a time where we are better aligned with our partners in the region than we're aligned with them today on Venezuela, but on a broad range of other issues as well.\nIn terms of military options or other options, there's no such thing really anymore as only a military option, or a diplomatic option, or an economic option. We try to integrate all elements together.\nNow, in terms of contingency planning and trying to envision what might trigger us to bringing to the President options -- we always look at a broad range of contingencies and how this might evolve in the future. But, obviously, any decision would be in conjunction with our partners in the region, and no military actions are anticipated in the near future. But what the President asked us to do is, he said look how this could evolve in the future, and provide a broad range, as we always do, integrated options for the President.\nQ: Thank you very much. I want to ask you about the decision yesterday in Venezuela. The government decided to order to cable television providers -- to cut the signal of two Colombia networks, (inaudible). And three years ago (inaudible). I want to know if you consider this a crackdown on freedom of speech by Nicolбs Maduro's regime. I don't know if you want to answer or --\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I think we've considered everything. And again, we'll continue to monitor the situation.\nYes.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. One gets the impression from the sanctions and what you said about the regime that the United States would only restore the normal situation -- the status quo -- if Maduro and his indicted Vice President are gone. Is that safe to say that the U.S. would only deal with a regime that does not include either of them?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: I'm not going to comment on the hypothetical of that. I think what the President is very clear on is the existing situation is unacceptable, and if they restore the proper democratic processes, we'll react to that appropriately. This is not about changing leadership, per se. This is about restoring the democratic process and rule of law.\nQ: Can you talk about debt restructuring -- how these sanctions impact the ability of Venezuela to engage in debt restructuring with U.S. investors?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, there will be no transactions with U.S. investors for new debt, including restructuring existing debt or extending maturities, without specific licenses being issued.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, going back to the debt ceiling, you sound completely confident the debt ceiling will be raised in September.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes. I am 100 percent confident. Leader McConnell said that same thing last week. I think there is no scenario where the government won't be paying its bills.\nQ: So what did the President mean when he said in a tweet this morning, now it's a mess? He said, \"It could have been easy if it was attached to the VA. Now a mess.\" What did he mean by that?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Again, I think there's a lot to do in September. We have the debt ceiling, we have the continuing resolution to fund the government, we have a budget. Congress has a lot of work this month, and I think the President and I wish that they had raised the debt ceiling before they left.\nHaving said that, we are where we are, and we're going to get it done.\nQ: If I could ask each of you gentlemen a question now that you're here. General McMaster, if you could help us all understand what the President meant on Monday night when he said that we're looking for an honorable and enduring outcome in Afghanistan.\nAnd, Mr. Secretary, if I could ask you -- your colleague, Gary Cohn, had remarks -- an interview with the Financial Times this morning in which he said he felt compelled to express his distress about the President's remarks last week. He said he felt intense pressure to resign. He said that he won't do so, but he believes that the administration must do better confronting hate groups. Do you associate yourself with those remarks? And did you feel the same pressure that Gary Cohn said he felt, to resign?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me first comment. I think you know I put out an extensive statement earlier last week on my view of the situation. I think there's no question that the President was not equating the hate groups with the people who were peacefully. And under no circumstances was I going to resign.\nGary and I have known each other for 20 years. I can tell you I'm speaking to him every day. His number-one focus is absolutely working on tax reform with me and getting tax reform done. And Gary is committed to be here, and I couldn't be more excited about that.\nGENERAL MCMASTER: In terms of the outcome in Afghanistan and, broadly, in connection with the South Asia strategy, the President gave us very clear guidance that we worked on, as you know, over the period of several months across the whole national security team. And that guidance was to prioritize the safety and security of the American people, and that's what our efforts are prioritizing now.\nThe second thing is he said that he wanted us to have a sound regional strategy, not a strategy that lasts a year. Some people have said -- and I think there's an element of truth to this -- that we've had 16 one-year strategies in Afghanistan. And so you see a fundamental change in an outcomes-based strategy rather than a time-based strategy. And what that does is give us the greatest chance to combine what we're doing militarily, largely in support of the Afghan government and their long struggle against terrorists and groups and the Taliban, but also to integrate that with what we hope to achieve diplomatically.\nI think it was clear to anyone that the approach of, \"Well, let's talk with the Taliban and tell them we're leaving at the same time,\" how would that ever work? Especially when the Taliban were making battlefield gains associated in large measure with our disengagement from the fight with the Taliban in support of the Afghan forces.\nAnd so it is a fundamental shift in the strategy. Those who have said, \"Well, this is more of the same,\" are absolutely wrong about that. Just think about that.\nConditions-based versus time-based. A regional approach rather a myopic focus on one little group or another group. You know, we tried very hard in Afghanistan over recent years to disconnect the dots. So we took a broad approach at this -- looking at this with our intelligence community and our partners, and the President has also asked us, how can others do more? How can others share more of the burden and the responsibility? And so this strategy delivers on all of that.\nIn connection with your answer, the answer is, the American people abroad and here at home are safe and secure from terrorists who could otherwise gain a safe haven and support base that they could use to organize, plan, finance and conduct attacks, not only in that region but globally. And we know that that's their design, and we know that from our own history, and we know that from the intelligence.\nQ: General McMaster, following on that, given the history and the ideology of the Taliban, are you confident that a political solution settlement could ever be reached with the Kabul government that wouldn't end up once U.S. forces leave Afghanistan and the Taliban reneging on their agreement and trying to take over Afghanistan?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: Well, no, I don't think I'm confident. I don't think anybody is confident about that unless we can demonstrate, through whatever an agreement is, that various groups who will cease their hostility to the Afghanistan government would then recognize that constitution and participate in a future of Afghanistan that is acceptable to the Afghan people.\nYou know, the Afghan people remember -- they remember 1996 to 2001 pretty vividly, and what it was like to live under that brutal regime. Now, the Taliban, as I mentioned -- we work hard sometimes to disconnect the dots here, especially in connection with the Taliban's relationship with al Qaeda, the Taliban's relationship with other terrorist organizations. But what we also recognize is none of these groups are monolithic or homogenous either. So if there are those who are ready to join a political process, like Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin did over the past year, then I don't think the Afghan government would object to that in any way.\nBut the critical thing is, if your enemies are fighting aggressively against you, it is not a good option to say you're not going to fight them anymore and then just hope for an outcome that secures the interest of the American people.\nQ: For General McMaster, could you define \"winning\" in Afghanistan? What does winning in Afghanistan look like for the United States?\nGENERAL MCMASTER: All right, so winning in Afghanistan is really aimed at allowing Afghanistan to be Afghanistan. As the President said, not to nation-build, not to create a state in U.S. image. Winning in Afghanistan means that there are not terrorist groups who are able to control key parts of the territory and population centers there that could be used to mobilize resources, raise funds, use those funds to then organize, plan, and conduct acts against us and our allies and partners.\nAnd so that's what the success is, is really a sustainable outcome there that ensures the safety and security of the American people. And, as you know, Afghanistan is connected to broader security concerns across the region. And so the outcome is to ensure that a threat from that region doesn't threaten the safety and security of the American people.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Last question right here.\nQ: Mr. Secretary, while you're here, if you don't mind -- on tax reform, yesterday Mitch McConnell said that this would happen during the Congress, suggesting that potentially this could be a 2018 event. Paul Ryan was much more certain, saying that this is going to happen in 2017. As you see it, the timeline, do you still believe that this can get done in 2017? And, secondly, now that this is being put in the hands of the committees from here on out to kind of do the work and come up with the figures, how confident are you that Congress can kind up handle this so you don't get burned on tax reform like you did with healthcare reform?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me just comment that, first of all, Gary and I have been very focused on tax reform, working with the leadership since January. I think you know, earlier in the year I said I thought we'd get it done by August, and I was wrong. Okay? I'm now going to say that I am very hopeful, and I think we can get this done by the end of the year. But we will Congress to revisit it.\nAnd let me just say, as we've said before: Our objective here is to have one plan that includes the administration, the House and the Senate to work very closely together. The Group of Six has been working nonstop. We've put out a statement on that. We'll continue to put more details. And I think that it's very important that both committees in the Senate and in the House have the ability to debate this and review it.\nBut I can assure you that the President's number-one objective is now to get tax reform done. He's going to go on the road. We're starting with his first trip next week, and the President is 100 percent supportive of us passing legislation this year.\nThank you, everybody.\nMR. BOSSERT: Everyone, sorry to move from one serious topic to another, but I wanted to come out and speak to you a little bit about Hurricane Harvey, the federal government's preparations, the state and local governments' preparations. If I could, I'll try to stick to the themes of informing you, then maybe influencing, and then maybe inspiring. Maybe the last will be a little bit too far for me to go.\nOur highest priority at this point is the safety of the public. And by that, we mean everyone in the path of the storm, but also the safety of the responders. So, life safety here is our priority.\nI want to walk through a few things that we've done. State and local officials have the lead for this, as always. We encourage individual responsibility and planning, as always. And I would stress that this is a serious storm. As you've seen from the reporting, we've had significant rainfall predicted. Storm surge in Texas and Louisiana over the weekend and into the next week are forecast to be serious.\nThis could remain a dangerous storm for several days, and certainly we don't want to lose any life. Flooding, flash flooding, and other high wind damages -- although we expect this to be a rain event more so than a wind event -- neither of those can be counted upon. So taking this seriously and preparing is very important.\nRight now, President Trump and his entire team have been actively engaged with the state and local officials in Texas and Louisiana preparing for this storm. As you know, President Trump spoke to both governors today, spoke to his FEMA Administrator, Brock Long, and myself and General Kelly. He also spoke to Acting Secretary Duke. We did that this morning around 10:15 a.m.\nUnder that leadership team -- we couldn't have a better team, to be honest. Under the leadership team at DHS, we're in good hands at the federal level. As you might know, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the FEMA Administrator are responsible for bringing together the firepower of the federal government to assist the state and local governments. But the state and local governments are in the lead here, and we've got a lot of respect for and a lot of faith in the governors of these respective states, as well, directly in the path.\nSo Governor John Bel Edwards in Louisiana has a strong handle on what he's doing, and Governor Abbott in Texas likewise.\nSo what we'd like to do is reinforce their planning efforts, challenge the people in the path to be prepared, to listen to their institutions and their state and local governments. Now is not the time to lose faith in your government institutions. Those emergency managers giving you advice and making recommendations for you to evacuate are doing so with your best interest at heart. We encourage you to listen to them.\nAnd then, lastly, I'd encourage a little shameless plug here for all Americans to visit Ready.gov. It sounds like something that might not teach you anything. Maybe you know how to take care of yourself, but I think maybe you'll learn something if you go there and it would help you and your family.\nSo with that, I'll take some questions. If I could start with Jon Karl.\nQ: Tom, give us an idea of what the President is doing to monitor the developments of the storm and what he'll be doing as he moves to Camp David this weekend. How is he going to be in touch with federal officials and local officials?\nMR. BOSSERT: First, I'll start with what he has done. We've been giving him fairly regular briefings. And by \"we,\" I mean John Kelly and myself. We've also had him in touch with his Secretary of Homeland Security and his FEMA Administrator.\nThat started several weeks ago, really several months ago, as we transitioned into this administration. You saw President Trump visit FEMA, give a talk to the team over there, but also to set his clear expectations for his new FEMA Administrator. I've known Administrator Long now for 15 years. We couldn't have picked a finer leader. He's had state director experience. He's had FEMA experience. He's absolutely the top of the top.\nAnd what the President will do as we move forward is continue talking directly with them, directly with the governors. If they have any unmet needs, that's our problem. The President won't tolerate that. But he'll also continue talking to me and the Secretary -- now Chief of Staff Kelly.\nAnd as we move out to Camp David, as you know, he's got the full resources and capability to communicate with us.\nQ: Will the President sign an emergency declaration before landfall -- that has happened in the past -- to pre-prepare and set the funding in motion even before the event happens? Is that being contemplated? Will that be done today?\nMR. BOSSERT: That's being contemplated, and what we'll do is take the governors' request. I believe the governors actually made that request. As you know, the process works thusly; first, the governor assesses whether he has unmet needs and the affected communities are unable to respond collectively to this event. If he makes that determination and a number of other statutory requirements, he then requests of the President federal assistance. That request moves through the FEMA regional administrator, to the FEMA Administrator, up to the President. I believe it's in that process right now.\nOnce it gets to the President of the United States with a formal recommendation from his FEMA Administrator, he'll act on that very quickly. I'm under the impression that the governor of Texas has made that request and it's at FEMA right now.\nQ: Would you anticipate it tonight?\nMR. BOSSERT: If all the conditions are met and if it's appropriate to provide federal assistance, I believe the President will be very aggressive in leaning forward and declaring that disaster.\nQ: Tom, Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley urged the President not to repeat the mistakes of the past -- 2005 Katrina, specifically. How much is that in the back of your mind as you prepare for landfall of Harvey?\nAnd also, in hurricanes past, typically there were events where the hurricane goes through, and then you come in in the aftermath to pick up the pieces. I know -- Mark Lemondi (ph) and I were at Katrina in 2005. We saw what happened there. This time, though, this is going to be a multi-day event. What sort of challenges does that present in terms of trying to get aid to people who need it immediately while you still have buckets of rain coming down?\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, so a number of good questions there. I'd start with the first one. I was also in and through, and had a role at FEMA during Hurricane Katrina. I remember it very clearly and had a role in helping our government write the \"lessons learned\" report from it. And so I think it's not just what's on my mind, but it's on the minds of all the emergency managers in our community, especially those in Texas and Louisiana. That experience is still in their memory. It's still in their experience, their muscle memory. And what we've done has gotten a lot better as a government.\nCongress has gotten better. It passed laws to allow us the flexibility we need to employ, not just deploy, resources and assets in advance of an event, which Brock Long has marshaled heretofore. He'll employ those resources carefully if the state requests and we grant that declaration, which I suspect we might.\nAnd then lastly, to your point about how difficult it is to get assistance to people, I would say this: You never want to plan for the federal government to swoop in and provide everything that you need when you need it just on time, right?\nIt's going to be 4.6 million people, I guess, in the path of the storm, depending on how the forecast goes. That's a lot of people. We encourage people to be ready, be prepared, take some responsibility for their own safety as the next 72 hours unfold.\nOf course, food, water, shelter are the primary concerns. But then secondly, when we provide that assistance, we do it in such a way that's so organized -- if things work out the way they're supposed to -- that the assistance flows either directly to the individuals that are eligible for it, or it flows to the state and local officials who have the logistics trail in place to provide that food, water, and those commodities, and the shelter.\nAnd lastly, I'd like to make a plug for non-governmental organizations as well. As you know, we've got a number of organizations, like the Red Cross and others, to manage shelters. Those types of resources are imperative to the people that are confronting this peril, and I'd like to thank them for their work.\nBefore I take that next question, I would say that I just came off of what FEMA organizes, which is a conference call -- actually, a video teleconference call with all the affected parties, and there were no unmet needs reported. We went across all the emergency support functions of the federal government, but also the state and local governments and the non-governmental organizations, and they all seem to be well-postured. And they didn't report to us any additional needs. In fact, they all reported that they're in the right operational posture right now to help the American people in the path of this storm.\nI'm going to take a question in the back, please.\nQ: Thank you, sir. The President tweeted out a photo of you briefing him this morning. What questions did President Trump have for you about the preparations that are underway?\nMR. BOSSERT: So the President had three primary concerns. His first concern was the life safety and evacuation timing. Are people getting out of harm's way that need to get out of harm's way? And then his second concern was, do we have the appropriate resources to bring to bear? That was a question he directed at Administrator Long and Elaine Duke. Brock Long reported to him that we did, in fact, have all those resources pre-deployed.\nAnd, really, the third concern from the President's perspective after hearing the briefing was not only that the people in harm's way in Texas be prepared and be evacuated as appropriate, but that the people in Louisiana, should the forecast wobble in any direction, also be prepared. And so, as we see this move to the south -- the forecast track -- don't lose track of the fact that we've got low-level areas all through the coast of Louisiana. Fifty-percent of the population of Louisiana lives on that coastal region. New Orleans, as we've seen before, to the allusion to Katrina, lives below sea level. They rely a great deal on pumps to pump water out.\nThe Army Corps of Engineers, with FEMA's coordination, have been providing necessary electric power generation to those pumps to make sure that if the conditions were to materialize in New Orleans, that we don't have necessarily bad flooding that would put lives in harm's way.\nAnd so those were his three concerns: New Orleans, Texas, life safety, and evacuations.\nYeah, thank you. I'm sorry, can I come here please?\nQ: Thank you. Can you tell us specifically who is going to be traveling with the President this weekend? You mentioned that you will be. Who will be accompanying you? And is there any discussion about the President canceling his trip, in light of everything that you're saying? And then can you just give us a sense of how he and you and your teams are thinking about this? Is this a storm, are you anticipating, that will be of the magnitude of Katrina, given all the comparisons?\nMR. BOSSERT: I don't want to make that comparison. I guess the first answer is, I don't have any insight into the travel package with the President, but I do have insight into the resources he has available to him at Camp David. So it is just as well-resourced as the White House, so he'll have access to anybody, all the communications means that he might need. So it's not a trip. I wouldn't characterize it as a trip. It's just 45 minutes up the road, as you all know. For those of you in America thinking Camp David is far away, it's right up the road.\nSo, secondly, I would say that we're not seeing this -- and every disaster is different, so I don't want to make any starch comparisons here -- strong comparisons, rather. Stark comparisons. But I would say this: For the person affected, if your house is flooded, it doesn't matter if 10,000 other houses are flooded or 10 houses are flooded. So what you need to do is be prepared for your own damages, your own consequences. The governments need to be prepared for the uniqueness of each community. We've got some low-level islands here -- Galveston and others -- that might be in the storm surge path.\nBut Katrina was a massive event. It was a staggering event that took place in just the perfect condition, and, as you know, we had a flooding event associated with levy failure and other things. So I don't want people to draw those comparisons. I won't characterize the magnitude of this event until it's over.\nGoing to go here.\nQ: The nation's fuel supply chain may be impacted by this hurricane. What are you doing to prepare for that? Give me a sense about the concerns that you've expressed to the President about that particular issue.\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, so a number of things inform my thinking here at the White House for the President. And one of the things I hope to do is have full faith and trust -- and I do in this case -- in the responders at the state and local level and at the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate and bring to bear the full resources of the Cabinet to keep this regional event focused on the life-saving, life-sustaining efforts and to make sure Americans in harm's way are protected.\nSecond concern you have, though, is making sure that that regional event doesn't lose containment and become a national or international event. And so as the refining capacity, as I understand it, approximately 50 percent of the Gulf Coast refining capacity and a third of the U.S. capacity is in the storm path. That's something we have to take very seriously. There have been reports on that speculating on potential gas price increases and so forth.\nI'm not in a position to confirm those increases, but I will tell you that the last report I received was that the appropriate steps were being taken by the private sector to take their refineries into a position where they were ready to withstand some wind and some flooding. We still have to wait it out, let Mother Nature play its course, and see what kind of damage is on the other side.\nBut the hope is they'll be able to fix those damages, repair them quickly, and be right back in business. And so, while a large proportion is affected, it might not cause a large and long-term disruption.\nQ: South Florida right now is marking the 25th anniversary of Hurricane Andrew. So in that situation, the FEMA response was incredibly slow. By comparison, how quickly are you prepared to move into Texas?\nMR. BOSSERT: We've made leaps and bounds since 1992 in our federal planning, in our state and local planning, and as an emergency management community as a whole. We had a federal response plan that failed. We updated that federal response plan after 1992. Then we had a 9/11 event that caused us to create a national response plan. We tested it in Katrina and found deficiencies, and created a national response framework. A great deal of effort went into changing those names of those documents, and a great deal of effort went into training the people to execute those changes.\nAnd so I've got a tremendous amount of experience here and a tremendous amount of confidence in the people at FEMA, and the people at the state and local levels in these emergency management operations centers. And I actually have a lot of confidence in the American people that they're going to do what they need to do in this case.\nQ: Can you give us a timetable? How quickly can you move into the area then?\nMR. BOSSERT: Well, it's not about how quickly we can move into the area. The federal government has already pre-positioned all sorts of resources in the area. So what we do is we begin helping people from before a storm landfall. We're already helping people in a way, depending how you assess and define that. So we're already providing resources. In fact, I mentioned as an example, the Army Corps is providing extra generation capacity. That's going to help a lot of people if those pumps stay running.\nSo we're already leaning forward, and the authorities that were given to us by Congress after Katrina have allowed us to do that in a more full-throated way.\nSir.\nQ: You mentioned in your opening statement that now is not the time to lose faith in your government institutions. That struck me as a very interesting line coming from somebody behind the White House podium. Can you talk a little bit -- expand on that a little bit? Is there a fear that you have or the administration has that either political climate or rhetoric being used either in this town or more broadly could have real impact on lives -- in this case, people maybe not listening to a government if they lost faith in their government, as you warned?\nMR. BOSSERT: No, not at all. I'm telling you from my own personal experience that it's important in every emergency, and I've been through a lot of them, to remind people to listen to their state and local officials. Because, inevitably, people don't, and then they end up thinking they wish they had. Right? So you have nothing to lose but your life, and I want you to take it seriously, and I want you to listen to those state and local officials.\nIn fact, I'm not worried about you losing faith in the federal government; I'm worried about you losing faith in the state and local government that provides you the best information that they have. And so don't worry about parsing whether they're right or wrong. If they're asking you to evacuate and telling you to do it now, listen to their advice.\nOftentimes people try to supplant their own judgement for theirs, and what they don't understand is the number of time and man-hours that go into planning those evacuation routes. You have to coordinate them with other counties farther north, and you have to do road closures and reverse the traffic flow, and there are things that people just might not be aware of. So have a little faith in the professionalism of your emergency managers, listen to their advice, and you'll be better off for it.\nAnd lastly, I'd say if you do, and you're out of harm's way, you don't put a responder's life in jeopardy later, and you allow us to recover more quickly, which is really the goal.\nQ: Because there has been some controversy in Texas -- I'm thinking of Corpus Christi -- about mandatory evacuation, can you add what FEMA's experience is, particularly related to the length of flooding that might follow this storm, about the federal government's perspective on whether local officials should or should not declare mandatory evacuations?\nMR. BOSSERT: No, I'm going to leave that judgement to the state and local officials that make those determinations. A lot is said about mandatory versus not mandatory, and that's one of the responsibilities I have here to enforce both of those decisions and to reinforce them with rhetoric. I think the idea here is, we have faith in their judgement. The people affected by those local government officials should as well. Mandatory or not, if you're asked to leave, I think it's a good idea to make those preparations and take those steps.\nQ: Related question on that. There's been some concern that patrol checkpoints for the Border Patrol north of the border in Texas are being maintained and that could dissuade some people from getting a shelter. Are you addressing that?\nMR. BOSSERT: Let me understand your question. There are people that can't get across the border for life-saving purposes?\nQ: No, not across the border. North of the border there are immigration inspection checkpoints, and supposedly those are being maintained, as well as the fears that there could be checks at shelters. So that would dissuade people from evacuating from –\nMR. BOSSERT: I haven't heard that, but people shouldn't be fearful of going to a shelter and receiving food and water. That's not a problem.\nQ: Tom, you have described your experience and Director Long's experience, but this is the first time President Trump will be in charge for a national disaster of this -- natural disaster of this scale. What do you think he has to project in terms of leadership or skillset for the country to feel that he has led well in this situation?\nMR. BOSSERT: This is right up President Trump's alley. Not only has he shown leadership here, but his entire focus has been on making America great again. He is focused on the Americans that voted him into office. He's focused on the Americans that didn't vote him into office. He's focused on effecting positive change in this country. And when we go in and brief him on the preparations for this hurricane, he is acutely focused on making sure that -- and just the right thing, by the way -- that the American people in the storm's path have what they need.\nHis questions weren't about geopolitical issues or about large political consequences. His questions were about, are you doing what it takes to help the people that are going to be affected by this storm.\nYou might not, if you're living in the northeast, think about this storm over the weekend; you might go about your business. But the President is worried about the 4.6 million people or so that are in that area of Texas that are going to be affected by this, because to them this is the most important thing they are going to have to worry about for the next 24, 48, 72 or more hours.\nSo from my perspective, I was extremely happy with his leadership instincts on this, and I think that that will carry through as you see him respond to this event.\nSir.\nQ: Governor Abbott has requested disaster declaration before landfall. Is that something the President would do? And does it really make much of a difference in the response, one way or the other?\nMR. BOSSERT: It can make a little bit of a difference here, and it makes every bit of a difference to the spirit mentality of the people that have to employ those resources. So to the extent that it meets the criteria, I would advise him to consider it very favorably. And to the extent that any ambiguity be cleared up at the implementation level, people know that they have the ability to employ resources for FEMA to start mission assigning and providing money to the other departments and agencies to do what they have to do. It's a good idea and there is precedent for it.\nQ: Was there any discussion with the President about him coming out and addressing the nation, given the magnitude, potential magnitude, of this storm? Should people be hearing from their Commander-in-Chief about the preparations the government is taking, and just hear it from his mouth that he believes that you should be listening to state and local officials and offer assurances at a time like this?\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, I think at the time when it's appropriate, the President will come out and address this. I think right now what's more appropriate is that the faces and the voices of this event be the two governors of the affected states.\nRemember, no matter what we do, no matter how forward- leaning we are, all the federal families here support the two governors in this event and any governor in this event, and they're there to support the local officials.\nSo this is kind of an enshrined principle of federalism. If and when this becomes of the magnitude and the severity that it overwhelms the state and affect local officials and the President declares such, and issues a declaration that this is a major disaster, provides all the federal assistance, then it might be a good opportunity for him to come out and speak to you on it. But for right now, let's hope and pray that people follow the advice of their officials; that they do what they have to do to stay out of harm's way, that there is no loss of life in this event.\nLet's say a little prayer for those that are affected over the weekend. Know that here in the White House, over across the street at DHS and FEMA, and all the way down to the lowest level -- local level -- in Louisiana and Texas, that people are doing the right thing.\nYou'll hear from the President later, I'm sure, if it merits. Let's hope that this event fizzles and that the forecasts are all wrong, but I don't think that is the right thing to hope for right now. We're executing and we're going to do what it takes to save people's lives and to make their lives easier as they sustain damage.\nSo I really appreciate your time today. Thank you very much. And we'll keep you informed, okay? Thank you.\nMS SANDERS: Thank you, Tom. Due to the President's departure coming up here shortly, I am going to take a few questions. We are a little tight on time today. I will skip any opening comments. But just so you're aware, the press staff will be around the rest of the day and throughout the weekend, providing updates both on the storm and any other issues that we certainly don't get a chance to cover today.\nAlso, we just received an update a few minutes ago that it looks like the President will try to make plans to go to Texas early next week. And we'll keep you posted on details about those as they're firmed up, and certainly on any other plans and schedule changes throughout the weekend.\nJonathan.\nQ: Sarah, has the President spoken to Gary Cohn about his comments? He said that the administration \"can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning hate groups.\"\nMS. SANDERS: The President is in regular contact with Gary. I'm not going to get into a deliberation on specific conversations they may have had. But the President has been very outspoken in his condemnation of racism, of bigotry, of hate of all forms.\nBut I think as long as those things exist, there's always more that we can do, and that we should be looking and we will be looking for ways that we can do more as an administration.\nUntil there is zero of those things, then there's always more that you can do. And I think that doesn't just happen within the administration, but I think that happens with the American people. I think that the President has called on America to come together to unite certainly throughout his comments over the course of the last week. And I think that's something that we should all step up and be willing to do is come together and look for ways that we can get rid of racism, bigotry, and hate in all forms.\nJohn.\nQ: What did the President mean --\nMS. SANDERS: John. Sorry, we're really tight on time, so I'm going to try to get to several of your colleagues.\nQ: What did the President mean when he said there were very fine people on both sides? Who were the very fine people who were protesting with the neo-Nazis at Charlottesville?\nMS. SANDERS: Go ahead, John. Sorry.\nQ: Who were the very fine people --\nMS. SANDERS: Jon, we're super tight on time, so I'm going to try to cover as many of your colleagues as possible.\nGo ahead.\nQ: I'm just wondering, was the President aware of the content of Gary Cohn's interview before it was published?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I think everybody wants to focus on a really small part of that interview. Ninety-five percent of that interview was on tax reform, and we're looking at a very small portion of it.\nThe President, as I said, and Gary have spoken many times. Gary has not held back what his feelings are --\nQ: Was he --\nMS. SANDERS: -- if you'll let me finish -- Gary has not held back how he feels about the situation. He's been very open and honest. And so I don't think that anyone was surprised by the comments.\nJen.\nQ: Two quick tax questions. For the Missouri trip next week, do you expect the President will reveal any new details about what he'd like to see in the tax reform overhaul?\nMS. SANDERS: If he is, I certainly wouldn't announce that today. I'll let the President do that while he's in Missouri next week. I know he's looking forward to really focusing on tax relief for middle-class Americans as we move into the fall. That's going to be a very big priority for this administration and something that I think everyone can expect to hear a lot more about over the coming weeks.\nQ: And then on the corporate tax rate --\nMS. SANDERS: Sorry. I've just got to keep moving because we're really tight today.\nQ: Sarah, the President mentioned two weeks ago possible military action in Venezuela, but H.R. McMaster just said that there's nothing in the near future. Does the President now feel that way? Or is he still pushing towards possible military action?\nMS. SANDERS: I think we've been clear that the focus is first to use things like sanctions. That's the first line. That's where we're focused on right now. And hopefully that will have the impact that we're looking for.\nAgain, as General McMaster said, we leave all options on the table, and we're not taking any of those things off. But nothing in the immediate. We're going to focus on these sanctions at this point.\nKristen. Sorry. Go ahead.\nQ: Sarah, thank you. I want to ask you about DACA. Has the President made a decision about whether to end or phase out DACA? And is that imminent?\nMS. SANDERS: The administration has indicated several times before that the DACA program is under review. It continues to be under review, and when we have an announcement on it, we'll let you guys know.\nQ: Is the decision imminent, Sarah?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, once we have an announcement on that, we'll let you know.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. A number of charities and other groups have cancelled events scheduled at Mar-a-Lago in the wake of the President's Charlottesville comments. Does that, coupled with these Mr. Cohn comments that we've discussed, the disbandment of the business council, does that make him rethink and reconsider at all his remarks and his reaction in the wake of Charlottesville?\nMS. SANDERS: I can't speak to anything regarding the Trump organization, but I can tell you that, again - and I'll echo the President's comments, his words, and his feelings on this situation -- is that he condemns this in the strongest form possible. We will continue to do that and continue to look for ways to bring America together. That's the focus of this administration currently and will continue to be as we move forward.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Sarah, the President today took to Twitter to criticize Senator Bob Corker. And in just the past month, he's criticized a number of Republican senators. He's criticized Leader McConnell on Twitter, Senator John McCain, Senator Flake, Senator Graham of South Carolina, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. What is the end game for the President? What does that do for him in terms of trying to move his legislative forward when he criticizes these important people, given the majorities are so slim in the Senate that are necessary to move his legislative agenda forward?\nMS. SANDERS: I think it's clear that the endgame is for Congress to do its job and actually pass legislation. I think the American people are very frustrated with Congress's lack of action. And for years they've been all talk and no action. We're looking for them to step up at this point.\nSorry, guys, to cut short today. We'll be around for the rest of this afternoon to answer your questions. But as you know, the President is departing here in a few minutes.\nThanks so much, guys.\nEND 2:44 P.M.

On the anniversary of that historic day, we celebrate Women's Equality Day and the innumerable contributions women have made to their families, their communities, and in service to our country.\nWomen's suffrage in America has its roots in the meeting of a group of trailblazers in 1848, in Seneca Falls, New York. While that meeting sparked a movement, suffragists fought for 72 long years thereafter to secure the vote for women nationwide. Women have always been instrumental to America's greatness, but with greater access to governing institutions through national suffrage, generations of women have been able to use the power of the ballot to shape their communities and help keep America a beacon of freedom and opportunity for the world.\nMy Administration will continue to support the advancement of women, in every corner of the Nation. One of my first actions as President was to establish the United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. Recently, I pledged $50 million to the new World Bank Group Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative. By expanding access to capital and networks, this important initiative will address many of the unique challenges women entrepreneurs in the developing world face when financing and growing their businesses. Through these efforts and others, we will support bold and innovative women leaders and entrepreneurs domestically and abroad, recognizing that their successes make our economy, and our Nation, stronger.\nMy Administration is committed to fostering an economy where all women can succeed and thrive. We must prioritize the needs of working mothers and families, including access to affordable childcare. Therefore, for the first time in the history of this country, my budget proposes a national paid family leave program. Our working families must be able to provide and care for their children without fear of financial insolvency, to strengthen our communities and drive a booming economy.\nAs President, I am also working to ensure that all women have access to the training they need to succeed in our modern economy, especially in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Women make up only 12 percent of engineers, and the percentage of women in computer and mathematical occupations has decreased over the past three decades. To empower women to participate in all sectors of our economy, my Administration is committed to workforce development, particularly through the expansion of apprenticeships and vocational education. We must break down the biases and barriers women in STEM face, and encourage every American to pursue excellence in his or her chosen field.\nAs we observe Women's Equality Day, commemorating the 19th Amendment, we honor America's female pioneers. These resilient women have inspired countless others to challenge the status quo in order to advance the ultimate American value: that all men and women are created equal. Together, we are creating a Nation where every daughter in America can grow up believing in herself, her future, and following her heart toward the American Dream.\nNow, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2017, as Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to celebrate the achievements of women and observe this day with appropriate programs and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\nDONALD J.

Policy. (a) Until June 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (collectively, the Departments) generally prohibited openly transgender individuals from accession into the United States military and authorized the discharge of such individuals. Shortly before President Obama left office, however, his Administration dismantled the Departments' established framework by permitting transgender individuals to serve openly in the military, authorizing the use of the Departments' resources to fund sex-reassignment surgical procedures, and permitting accession of such individuals after July 1, 2017. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security have since extended the deadline to alter the currently effective accession policy to January 1, 2018, while the Departments continue to study the issue.\nIn my judgment, the previous Administration failed to identify a sufficient basis to conclude that terminating the Departments' longstanding policy and practice would not hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unit cohesion, or tax military resources, and there remain meaningful concerns that further study is needed to ensure that continued implementation of last year's policy change would not have those negative effects.\n(b) Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States under the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including Article II of the Constitution, I am directing the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard, to return to the longstanding policy and practice on military service by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June 2016 until such time as a sufficient basis exists upon which to conclude that terminating that policy and practice would not have the negative effects discussed above. The Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may advise me at any time, in writing, that a change to this policy is warranted.\nSec. 2. Directives. The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard, shall:\n(a) maintain the currently effective policy regarding accession of transgender individuals into military service beyond January 1, 2018, until such time as the Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the Secretary of Homeland Security, provides a recommendation to the contrary that I find convincing; and\n(b) halt all use of DoD or DHS resources to fund sex-reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel, except to the extent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex.\nSec. 3. Effective Dates and Implementation. Section 2(a) of this memorandum shall take effect on January 1, 2018. Sections 1(b) and 2(b) of this memorandum shall take effect on March 23, 2018. By February 21, 2018, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall submit to me a plan for implementing both the general policy set forth in section 1(b) of this memorandum and the specific directives set forth in section 2 of this memorandum. The implementation plan shall adhere to the determinations of the Secretary of Defense, made in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, as to what steps are appropriate and consistent with military effectiveness and lethality, budgetary constraints, and applicable law. As part of the implementation plan, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall determine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military. Until the Secretary has made that determination, no action may be taken against such individuals under the policy set forth in section 1(b) of this memorandum.\nSec. 4. Severability. If any provision of this memorandum, or the application of any provision of this memorandum, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this memorandum and other dissimilar applications of the provision shall not be affected.\nSec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d) The Secretary of Defense is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nDONALD J.

Welcome.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Michael and Shara, thank you for having me on. Let me say on behalf of the President and our entire administration, our hearts are all in Houston today. And our prayers and the concerted effort of our national government and local and state officials are continuing to lean forward into a rescue operation, and our prayers also are with you all.\nQ: Well, Vice President Pence, I know you you've been a governor for the last four years before being the Vice President. You understand the importance of those federal assets -- the federal declarations, the FEMA assistance. What can we expect in the coming days?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, as you know, Mike, the President made his decision on Friday night, before landfall, to issue an emergency declaration with regard to Texas. In fact, this morning the President also issued an emergency declaration with regard to Louisiana as we continue to see the impact of this storm.\nAnd let me just say, from those early hours, President Trump and our entire administration have been working closely with Governor Abbott and with officials at every level to bring the full resources of the federal government to bear.\nAs we speak, I hope it is encouragement to your listeners to know that there are more than 8,000 federal officials in the area. We've already shipped more than 1.2 million meals, a million liters of water, and we continue to support some 65 mobile emergency resource support personnel and 10 mobile communications offices to get people as quickly as possible out of harm's way. But I just can't --\nQ: It's a big task.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, it's extraordinary, and I have to tell you, Shara, it is moving to hear the reports over the course of the weekend. The President assembled the Cabinet twice. We received continuous reports about the challenges, not just the devastation of the storm as it came ashore, but obviously the rising flood waters.\nAnd right now, as you all know, we're focused on a rescue operation. And we just encourage all of your listeners, as so many others have, to listen to local emergency management officials. If they find themselves in an immediate need of medical attention or evacuation assistance, to call 911. They also can call one of several numbers of the Houston command center of the United States Coast Guard. One of those numbers is 281-464-4851. All the numbers are available at FEMA.gov if people are able to get online.\nBut as you all know, the focus today is on making sure that we're doing everything to get people out of harm's way, and that includes an enormous volunteer effort.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, you know your FEMA director -- they've been holding news conferences -- and they've already said that they expect that they're going to have to be in this region for years.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we truly believe --\nQ: Is there that type of commitment behind that? Can we count on that?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I think what you're going to see is that the national government, and we anticipate the Congress, are going to make the resources available to see Texas through the rescue operation, through the recovery. But's there simply no question, when you look from afar, Shara -- when you look at the magnitude of the flooding that's taken place in the 4th largest city in the United States, that we anticipate that it will be years coming back.\nBut Houston and Texas are strong. The people are resilient. You see that in the extraordinary outpouring of volunteer efforts -- people reaching out, making boats available, and volunteering, the number of people that have already gone online to Redcross.org or to other organizations to begin to provide resources.\nWe know we'll be there to rebuild, and the American people are with you.\nQ: Vice President Mike Pence, we appreciate you being with us. The President has said that he did not want to be a distraction, but he does want to be here. And I think the consensus is people would like him to come and see what is happening. We've heard that that visit will be tomorrow. Do you have any more details on that?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Mike, those details will be forthcoming, but I can tell you that from Friday night forward, the President has been continuously engaged in this. And we've all been deeply concerned about the impact of this storm. We're saddened by the loss of life, and the President is anxious to come to the region tomorrow. The President and the First Lady will be there, along with a number of other Cabinet officials.\nBut it's really -- again, we understand, as the President has said, we are at the beginning of this effort. The focus now completely is on lifesaving efforts. We just encourage people within the sound of our voice that if you are in a place that is warm and dry and you have provisions, to just continue to shelter-in-place, unless local officials tell you to do otherwise.\nAnd just know that we'll get through this. The President will be there tomorrow. But again, we will not relent in our effort to see the rescue operations done thoroughly, working with local emergency managers and officials. And then the recovery effort will be long term, and we'll be there. We're with you.\nQ: Vice President Pence, I don't have to tell you what assets you have in the Cabinet, but there's one fellow sitting at that table who's the Secretary of Energy who did a great job for well over a decade with just these sorts of emergencies. I hope he's part of the team.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I'll tell you, our Secretary -- your former governor -- Rick Perry has been intimately involved in all of these efforts in the Cabinet meetings, not only in his new role with regard to energy, which has such an enormously important role in that region, but just bringing his practical experience and his deep love and admiration for the people of Texas.\nI would just say to anyone that is within the sound of our voice, again, listen to local emergency officials. And if you can be helpful, we just encourage you to go to NVOAD.org to find national organizations active in the disaster, or go online with Redcross.org. There will be an awful lot of needs; the federal government, the state government will be there. But I know people who are not affected by this, who are anxious to help their neighbors and friends, are doing that as we speak.\nAnd, frankly, Texas is inspiring the nation with the outpouring of support and concern for your neighbors, and the courage of the first responders that we're seeing hour by hour.\nQ: Well, we appreciate that very much, as well as we appreciate the people from other states who have come in and offered their aid as well. And certainly, we appreciate what the federal government is doing for us and the quick response -- because, indeed, they're here and they're already working. And one thing that really, I think, impresses all of us in Texas is the fact that they keeping saying, \"Look, we're here -- we're here in a support role. We're not here to come in and tell you what to do. We're here in a support role. Please pay attention to your local officials.\" And that's very much appreciated, Mr. Vice President.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Shara, you're exactly right. You know, before I was the Vice President, I was a governor. In these situations, the state governments and local officials take the lead, and the federal government is there to provide the support.\nBut President Trump wanted FEMA on the ground from go. That's why he signed the emergency declaration even before landfall. And we're there now. As I mentioned, more than 8,000 federal officials will continue to provide the supporting role.\nBut we know that Texas is strong. The people of Texas are resilient and generous. And I have to tell you that to watch and to witness the response by the state of Texas, by your local first responders, and by the countless volunteers that are coming alongside neighbors and friends -- it is inspiring the nation. And we're going to continue to provide the federal response that the American people expect to see in this moment.\nAnd President Trump is continuing to marshal the full resources of the government through rescue. And we'll be there through recovery, Mike and Shara. We'll see Houston all the way back, and the whole region, back to security and to prosperity.\nQ: Vice President Mike Pence, the good people of Texas thank you. Appreciate your time.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: You bet. God bless you all.", "timestamp": "2017-08-28", "title": "Interview of the Vice President by Michael Berry and Shara Fryer, KTRH"}
{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128132", "text": "Q: Sir, thank you for being with us on The Chris Salcedo Show.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, good morning, Chris. Thank you for having me on, and thank you for all you've done to get the word out in the midst of this crisis.\nI'm speaking to you from the White House, but I can assure you, on behalf of the President and myself, our entire administration, the hearts of every American are in Houston today and with all of those affected by the impact of Hurricane Harvey and, of course, its aftermath with the historic flooding.\nQ: Indeed. Let's detail some of that federal response and the assets that are on the ground courtesy of the federal government. Can you give us a rundown?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I sure can. At this point, it's important to note that in moments like this -- as I knew back in the time that I was governor of Indiana -- Chris, as you well know, the state is in the lead. Governor Abbott has been very gracious in his words about the response of our administration and the swift response by President Trump in issuing an emergency declaration, even before landfall of Hurricane Harvey.\nBut in moments like this, your listeners know well, the state is in the lead. And it is important, and we can't say often enough, that it's important that people continue to follow the instructions of state and local officials, whether that's shelter-in-place, or to evacuate, or to not return to an evacuated areas. Local and state officials are in the lead, and the role of the federal government is to provide support.\nAnd at President Trump's direction, we've been bringing the full resources of our national government to bear on the impact of Hurricane Harvey and, of course, the flooding, the rescue that's underway, and the recovery that will follow. We're with you.\nWe've deployed now more than 8,000 officials working through FEMA -- are literally on the ground supporting response in Texas and Louisiana. We have literally dozens of Coast Guard helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, well over a hundred shallow water rescue boats working with Texas officials, and more than 3,000 National Guard.\nPeople should also know that there are literally several dozen states that have provided task forces for rescue operations, and this is really an all-hands-on-deck effort, not only for the state of Texas and local officials, but for the federal government and states around the country. The focus right now, Chris, as you know, is on lifesaving efforts, and we will continue in the midst of this tropical storm to do everything in our power to get people out of harm's way and to conduct rescue operations. We are just so inspired by the efforts of first responders; in many cases, in the midst of a tropical storm, have been out in the air and on the water rescuing people.\nAnd lastly, I would say to you, the President and I are deeply inspired by the volunteer effort that's been underway. Hundreds and hundreds of small boats that have been making their way down streets, finding neighbors and friends, the most vulnerable -- especially the elderly.\nTexas is inspiring the nation by your volunteer efforts, by the heroism of your first responders. And at that the direction of President Donald Trump, I can assure you we are with you, we're going to stay with you with the full resources of the national government through this rescue operation into the recovery efforts, until we see all of eastern Texas restored from the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.\nQ: Yeah, that is truly a testament to the American spirit -- what we've been seeing from civilians coordinating their efforts with our brave first responders, running toward danger.\nVice President Mike Pence, our guest right now on The Chris Salcedo Show, let's move forward. The storm is (inaudible) with us at least past the middle of the week and a maybe a little beyond, depending on how long it meanders. And folks want to know, will the federal government be there afterward to help in the rebuilding efforts. Can you assure the people of Texas that will happen, sir?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, let me assure all of your listeners that while the focus at this hour is on lifesaving efforts and rescue operations, we know -- as the FEMA director said this morning, Brock Long, at a press conference -- we know that literally, Houston and all the surrounding areas, Corpus Christi and the like, this will be years coming back. And we are with you.\nFamilies that are affected by this should know that there is disaster assistance available. Businesses later this week -- we'll make sure and unpack small business loans that are available through the Small Business Administration. There's a broad range of resources that are available, and we're very confident that, working with the Congress, we'll be there for the long haul. We'll see Houston all the way back and provide all of the appropriate support from the federal government.\nI do also want to encourage all of your listeners whose hearts are as moved by the suffering and the impact of Hurricane Harvey, as the President and I and our entire team: Take the opportunity to respond to that concern by supporting Red Cross, by supporting faith-based organizations that are already coming alongside in the midst of the storm, making resources and support available. We've actually got a website -- NVOAD.org -- which lists the national organizations active in disasters -- NVOAD.org. Or you can just go to Redcross.org and make a contribution.\nWe spoke to the leadership of Red Cross on Saturday. They already had hundreds of volunteers on the ground. These non-government groups and faith-based groups are full partners in these moments. And as we move forward into the long recovery, long after the water is gone, there will be families that are hurting, there will be real needs. Your national government, your state government, and these faith-based organizations and charities will be there as well.\nAnd people who are as moved as we all are across the country with what's happening in Texas should respond as they're able to with generosity and, I'd also say, with prayer, Chris. We've been praying for all the families affected by this storm. From landfall to this very hour, our little family has been praying. We've all been carrying Texas in prayer, and we urge people to remember all of those that are hunkered down in dealing with this storm to the best of their ability.\nQ: Only got about a minute left, Mr. Vice President. I hate to even talk about this, but politics has reared its ugly head before the rain even started falling. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas congresswoman, tried to put some blame early on the administration. \"Texas has been through major storms,\" she wrote on a tweet, \"in the Gulf. Trump has not. He needs to move quickly declaring a federal disaster area in Texas.\" Of course, this was already underway when she tweeted this. Mr. Acosta from CNN jumping on board right away saying, \"Good morning, Mr. President. What is your administration doing to keep Texans safe?\"\nFor those who are trying to make political hay of this, do you have a message for those folks, too?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I couldn't be more proud of President Trump's leadership, of the leadership of Governor Abbott and all the local officials and first responders in Texas. And we're going to continue to keep our eye focused completely on the rescue and recovery efforts.\nI expect there will be plenty of time to debate all of this in the days ahead, but I can assure you that from the President on down, we're completely focused on doing everything in our power to get people out of harm's way, to engage in lifesaving efforts, and to continue to lean into this effort to assist in the long-term recovery that will be required in Texas.\nBut I would just say as a last thought -- I know your time is short, Chris. Thanks for letting me come on. Just encourage everyone in the sound of my voice, continue to follow the instructions of state and local officials, whether that's shelter-in-place or evacuate. And to those that are thinking about getting on the road to try and leave an area or to return to an evacuated area, we just encourage them: Listen to your local officials. Don't put your life at risk. And if you need help, to call 911 or all of the other resources. And help is on the way.\nQ: The Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence.

Mr. Vice President, thank you, it's an honor to visit with you this morning, sir.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Good morning, Trey, and thanks for everything you've done from San Antonio to help bring relief and comfort and support to all of those affected by Hurricane Harvey. I can speak on behalf of the President, our entire administration -- we've been deeply moved by those that have been suffering under this hurricane since it made landfall and now the historic flooding. And, frankly, we've also been deeply inspired by the people the people of Texas, by your first responders, by neighbors who are coming alongside people in the midst of this hardship. And just know all of our hearts are in Texas, from all across America and from here at the White House.\nQ: Thank you very much, sir. You know, we have a great Governor here who is doing a wonderful job. He has stepped up to the plate. We've had a number of local officials -- it's the local officials who really lead the charge in something like this.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: That's exactly correct. And we commend Governor Abbott and local officials for just an extraordinary effort. You're absolutely right. I remember this during my days as governor of Indiana, Trey, that when the rain comes down and beats against the house, and the flood waters rise and the wind blows, states are in the lead and your local first responders and local emergency managers.\nBut the federal government has a vital role in providing support. And from even before landfall, President Trump directed the full resources of the federal government to support the people of Texas and, as of this morning, the people of Louisiana, in the midst of this storm.\nAs I speak to you, we have some 8,000 federal officials working through FEMA on the ground in Texas and Louisiana. We have dozens of fixed-wing and helicopter aircraft with the Coast Guard that are supporting National Guard efforts.\nThere have literally been thousands of rescues by air and shallow water. And also, the people of Texas should know as well that there literally have been several dozen task forces deployed under FEMA from states around the country. We have first responders from around the country that are on the ground -- in many cases, at risk of their own personal safety -- that have been involved in the rescue effort. And that's where our focus is right now, Trey. It's at 100 percent on rescue, on lifesaving efforts.\nRecovery will come, but as the flood waters continue to rise, the rain continues to fall, our focus is on saving lives and supporting the efforts of the state of Texas and local emergency personnel to accomplish that mission. And our only message, if your listeners are talking to neighbors and friends across the affected areas in southeast Texas, is just listen to local officials. That is the standing order. Everyone should continue to follow the instructions of state and local officials, whether that's shelter-in-place, or evacuate. And especially if there's a life-threatening situation or health situation, people can call 911 and get the assistance that they need.\nBut the most important thing is that people listen -- listen to local officials about how to respond. And we'll get through this and the federal government will be there for the long haul to help rebuild Texas and all the affected areas from Hurricane Harvey.\nQ: I'm going to get into that federal government response in just a minute. I am visiting with Vice President Mike Pence. Trey Ware here on KTSA, talking about these local officials and your great advice there. There's millions of people listening to us right now. The amazing thing about this, Mr. Vice President, is the fact that the loss of life -- right now the numbers are at five. Now, that number could change, but it certainly is far less than what was anticipated in a storm of this magnitude, and I think that's a credit not only to local officials but the public responding and doing what they needed to do.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, look, Texans are tough and --\nQ: (Laughter.) That's true.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And, look, in Texas you've dealt with a lot of hardship, you've dealt with hurricanes in the past that have come through. We grieve for the loss of life. And as rescue operations go forward and our first responders continue to get into these affected areas. We hope and we pray that those numbers will not increase.\nBut is a testament to local officials. It's a testament to people responding to the direction that they receive from their state and local government. But people should know within the sound of our voice, particularly if they have families and friends across the area, Trey, is just, we are 100 percent now focused on rescue efforts. There will be disaster assistance available for businesses. There will be small business loans available. There will be plenty of time, once the flood waters begin to recede, for us to begin to deploy those resources.\nBut right now is on lifesaving efforts -- getting people out of harm's way and also making sure -- the federal government has already shipped more than a million meals, more than a million liters of water with millions more on the way, cots, blankets, medical supplies --\nQ: Generators.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right. And the response from the Red Cross, by faith-based organizations that already have been on the ground since this weekend has been deeply inspiring.\nQ: Before I let you go, I know the President is planning a trip here tomorrow. Do we know when and where specifically?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Those details will be forthcoming, Trey. I know the President and the First Lady have been very anxious to come to the area to see firsthand the efforts that are underway and to come alongside. I know in San Antonio you have more than a thousand people in shelters already. But the President wants to be there and make sure the families and all of those affected and our first responders know that we are with you.\nI can tell you, having spent a good part of the weekend with the President in Cabinet meetings called on Saturday and on Sunday, the President has been continuously updated, fully engaged, he's deployed the full resources of the national government. He'll reflect on that tomorrow, and people can just be confident that as we move through this rescue operation that we're there for the long haul. We're there for the long haul with Texas through the recovery efforts.\nBut now is the time to focus on lifesaving efforts. And if I have one message for your millions of listeners is just make sure they tell folks to listen to local emergency managers and officials. This continues to be a very dangerous storm, and we're not out of the woods. And life-threatening flooding will continue to occur, and people just simply need to continue to heed the direction of local officials. And we'll continue to lean into this effort with our support.\nAnd, of course, you all should know that the prayers of millions of Americans, including our families here at the White House, are all with the people of Texas.\nQ: It means everything in the world to us, sir. I appreciate your time, and when we get through this and get to the other side, you are welcome here anytime. I'd love to sit down and have you on the show and let's just shoot the breeze and talk a little bit.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thanks, Trey. We'll make a point of it. Thanks for all you're doing to help the people of Texas through this very difficult time.\nQ: Thank you, sir. We'll visit again soon.", "timestamp": "2017-08-28", "title": "Interview of the Vice President by Trey Ware, \"The Trey Ware Morning Show,\" KTSA"}
{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128134", "text": "Q: Mr. Vice President, are you there?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I'm here, loud and clear, coming to you from FEMA Headquarters.\nQ: All right, sir. We appreciate it. You're on with KHOU here in Houston. My name is Russ Lewis. We have our crew here. We've been on the air for many, many hours and we appreciate you checking in with us.\nSo you're at FEMA Headquarters. Let's just talk about what you're seeing there. We heard from somebody from FEMA at a press conference this morning. What are you seeing there right now?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, Russ, first, let me say the President asked me to come here -- FEMA Headquarters -- this morning to meet with our personnel. And let me convey the President's thoughts and prayers, and the determination of all of us here to continue to provide all of the support of the federal government to state and local efforts there in Houston.\nI can tell you, the hearts of every American are in Houston today. We are with you and we will continue to bring the full weight of the federal government behind the efforts to see to the rescue of those who are in harm's way and also to the long-term effort of recovery that will be necessary to bring this great city and this great region of the state of Texas back.\nQ: We know how important it is, Mr. Vice President, for the state to be in direct touch with FEMA to make the requests needed. Is that communication happening as well as it should, as far as you can tell?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: We commend Governor Abbott and local officials on the extraordinary cooperation that's taken place, Russ, frankly, since before the storm made landfall on Friday. As you know, at the state's urging, President Trump issued an emergency declaration on Friday night that made it possible for the full resources of the federal government -- now more than 8,500 federal personnel that are in southeast Texas today, in the Houston area today -- to be on the ground. We pre-positioned resources to be able to assist state and local officials.\nAs you know, Russ, state governments and local governments are in the lead. We greatly admire the work that Governor Abbott, the National Guard, local officials, and all your courageous first responders are taking. But from even before this storm came ashore, with the direction of President Trump and his declaration, the full weight of the federal government has been there.\nAnd I want to urge your viewers to continue to heed the direction of local emergency management personnel, but know that the federal government is there now. We're on the ground, we're increasing our presence and our commitment, and we will see this through -- through the rescue phase and all the way through to the recovery phase.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, there's concern about money -- FEMA having enough of it to respond properly to this. We understand there's only $3 billion or so in the disaster relief fund. Is that enough? Does Congress need to appropriate more? There was so much more for a storm like Katrina; doesn't appear to be that much right now. What's going on there?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, in speaking with FEMA officials, we truly believe that we have the reserves to address the financial burden of this crisis. But candidly, Russ, before I was Vice President, I was a governor. Before that, I was in the Congress. And we're very confident that the Congress of the United States is going to be there to provide the resources necessary -- not only that that we already have with regard to rescue efforts, but to make sure that the disaster assistance that already some 22,000 Texans have signed up for is available and is there.\nWe actually anticipate that as many as a half-a-million people in Texas will be eligible for and applying for financial disaster assistance, and we remain very confident that with the reserves and with the support in the Congress, we'll have the resources that we need.\nBut right now, as you know very well, the focus now is on rescue, on getting people out of harm's way, on making sure that anyone within the sound of my voice heeds the direction of local officials; not put themselves into harm's way by attempting to enter what could be very dangerous flooding and is, in fact, a very dangerous storm, as we speak; or, in some cases there have been some reports of people trying to return to areas that have been evacuated.\nThe President and I could not be more grateful for the efforts of state and local officials in Texas. But it's so important that Texans continue to do what people have been doing, and that is listening to local emergency management officials and making sure that they and their families stay safe.\nQ: All right, we're out of time, Mr. Vice President. Real quick though -- is the President coming to Texas? We're hearing that, but have not heard anything official. Have you?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I actually just left the White House this morning, and the President is finishing plans to come to Texas tomorrow. The President and the First Lady will be traveling to Texas. But as you know, from the time the President signed the emergency declaration on Friday, to assembling the Cabinet twice over the weekend, the President has been in continuous contact with our emergency management personnel here, with state and local leadership in Texas. And the President has made it very clear that our entire administration is to bring the full weight of federal support to state and local efforts to meet this crisis.\nWe know it's far from over. We know there's more rain coming. The flood waters will likely continue to rise. But your viewers should know that they have the support of this administration from the President on down. We'll continue to provide all the support to state and local officials.\nAnd let me also say, on behalf of the President and our families here in the administration, and we're continuing to carry the people of southeast Texas and Houston in our prayers. So you'll have our support, you'll have our prayers, and we'll keep all that coming.\nQ: Vice President Mike Pence, thank you very much for joining us here on KHOU. We appreciate it. We look forward to the President's visit here to the state tomorrow.", "timestamp": "2017-08-28", "title": "Interview of the Vice President by Russ Lewis, KHOU-Houston"}

Happy to have you here.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Rush. Great to be back on. Thank you for the opportunity to speak about the extraordinary events taking place in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. I know that millions of your listeners are supporting the families and communities that are affected with prayers and supporting organizations who are coming alongside. But I appreciate the opportunity to talk about the efforts of the federal, state, and local governments to provide resources and support for rescue and recovery.\nQ: How is it all going? How would you assess -- I know you're biased, but how would you assess the effort so far?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I would tell you, I just walked out of FEMA; President Trump directed me to head over there for a quick update. And I think it is important that all of your listens know that this is still a very dangerous storm. Particularly people in the affected areas, in Texas and Louisiana, need to approach this with great caution. Listen to local emergency management officials. Heed their warnings and their direction.\nBut I think the American people can be very proud of the effort that Governor Abbott of Texas and local first responders are making. And I'm very proud of the strong leadership President Trump has provided for our entire administration. We have more than 8,500 federal employees on the ground. We have dozens of Coast Guard assets in the air -- fixed-wing, helicopter. The Coast Guard is involved in rescue operations. And frankly, you know, the volunteer effort that is also underway, where people are heading out, looking after vulnerable neighbors and friends who are stranded in the midst of this historic flood -- it reminds us of everything that's great about being an American.\nBut, look, it's early in this process. We're 100 percent focused on lifesaving efforts right now. But the President and the First Lady will be there tomorrow. We already have our FEMA Director, Brock Long, on the ground in Texas today. But once the flood waters subside, then the real work of recovery will begin in earnest, and we're going to be making sure upwards to a half-a -million Americans that may be eligible for disaster assistance know that we are with them, we'll support them. And we'll see Houston and southeast Texas all the way through this crisis.\nQ: You mentioned something here that I have observed myself, and that is that -- it's a sad thing, Mr. Vice President, but so much in our life has become politicized. But this incident, it has its political elements if you go to the wrong places in the media, but people that are on the ground there don't seem to be involved in that at all. There is a great display of self-reliance. There is a great display of neighbor helping neighbor; Americans setting aside, whatever it is that divides them -- and it may not be that much anyway -- and all banding together to help.\nIt seems like a unified effort here. You have a number of celebrities that are running charitable donation efforts here. It seems like a lot of things came together immediately when this storm hit; even some of the things got set up before the storm hit. And it seems like it's being met as well as it could be.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we're leaning into this effort, but I don't think you could have said it better than you just said it. These moments bring out the character of our nation. We're seeing the generosity, the compassion, the courage of the American people in high relief, whether it be the first responders who -- you know, the Coast Guard is in the air -- was in the air as of yesterday even though this is still a tropical storm. I mean, you have first responders who have risked life and limb to rescue families that were stranded after Hurricane Harvey made landfall.\nBut to see the way that people are volunteering, to see the way that people are contacting the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, Samaritan's Purse, and other organizations, and providing the necessary financial resources that those groups are already deploying on the ground is -- it just -- it really is deeply inspiring to President Trump and myself and to our entire administration.\nBut I can't say enough to your millions of listeners, particularly those in the affected areas, with families in the affected areas, just to note this is still a very dangerous storm. And while the federal government is there now with more than 8,500 officials on the ground, we've been moving literally over a million meals and over a million liters of water. We positioned Coast Guard assets, Navy assets. But the reality is that this is a long way from over. It could get worse before it gets better, with additional rain coming. And we need to --\nQ: The rebuilding phase, that's going to start the -- I mean, once we get past this and the water recedes, and then people see the full impact of the damage, that's when they're going to be reaching out to you because that's rebuilding time and this is where it --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: That's right.\nQ: It's going to be a long-time, ongoing effort here, wouldn't you say?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. You know, it will be. And people within the sound of my voice who are in the affected areas or have families should know that they can go to DisasterAssistance.gov and they can already begin -- we have some 22,000 that have already registered for disaster assistance, and there's a broad range of financial support that is available to support housing, to support businesses that are affected by storms of this magnitude. And we think there might be as many as a half-a-million people ultimately eligible, given the enormity of this storm.\nQ: Wow.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And again, people can go to DisasterAssistance.gov and already begin to register for that assistance.\nBut your listeners should know, Rush, 100 percent of our focus, 100 percent of the focus in that room in FEMA that I just left five minutes ago is on the rescue operation. And it's just so important that people listen to local officials -- if they're to shelter in place, to stay there; not to return to areas that have been evacuated; not attempt to get out into what is still a very dangerous storm. And --\nQ: Mr. Vice President, I'm down to five seconds and I know you have your meeting to go to. Thanks for making time for us today. I'm sure it was valuable and worthwhile for many. We'll be back here, folks. Don't go away.", "timestamp": "2017-08-28", "title": "Interview of the Vice President by Rush Limbaugh of \"The Rush Limbaugh Show\""}

It's my honor to have President Niinistö of Finland, a country that we have had a wonderful relationship. We're working with them very strongly right now. We have trading relationships. Sadly, they have a trade surplus against the United States, but maybe we can do something to change that.\nBut it's a great honor to have you. Your country has done very well. It's doing extremely well under your leadership. And an honor to have you at the Oval Office.\nThank you very much.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: Thank you so very much. It's an honor to be in the Oval Office. Just a reminder, even though the balance is pro for us, the balance of the investments is different. (Inaudible.)\nMr. President, I would like to say that what we are seeing in Texas -- our thoughts are with those people.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: And I am sure that they and you, Mr. President, have the strength and courage to overcome the disaster.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, that's very nice. And we appreciate it. And coming from yourself and the people of Finland, I very much appreciate it. Thank you.\nThank you, everybody. Thank you very much.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I'll be going to Texas tomorrow. I look very much forward to it. Things are being handled really well. The spirit is incredible of the people. The coordination between all of the different services, as you know, has been going very well. Great respect for the governor. He's done an incredible job.\nAnd I look forward to the trip. So I'll be going there tomorrow. We're leaving at about 8:30 in the morning. We don't know exactly which sections; we'll be notifying you soon. But we'll be traveling throughout certain parts, and we may actually go back on Saturday. Depending on where the storm goes, we may also go to Louisiana on Saturday.\nQ: Are you surprised at the magnitude?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: It's the biggest ever. They're saying it's the biggest. It's historic. It's like -- really, like Texas, if you think about it. But it is a historic amount of water in particular. There's never been anything like it.\nSo the people are handling it amazingly well. And the people of Texas, as you know, have really persevered. And when you watch the spirit and the enthusiasm, and helping each other, the teamwork, it's really been something for people to say -- I think even in Finland they would say it's been pretty incredible what they've been able to do.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: We have noticed that, yes. Wonderful.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: It's been really something.\nSo we'll be leaving tomorrow at about 8:30 in the morning.\nQ: Will you be doing anything special, sir, with the Cabinet or Congress?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we've done quite a few Cabinet meetings to make sure everything is coordinated. We're dealing with Congress. As you know, it's going to be a very expensive situation. We want to take care of the people of Texas and Louisiana, when that happens. Let's see what happens with the flow. The flow seems to be heading toward Louisiana right now, as we speak. But we'll be there for the people of Louisiana also, very much so.\nSo we'll see you tomorrow. And I guess you'll see both of us in a couple of minutes in the East Room.\nThank you all very much.

It is my great honor to welcome President Niinistö to the White House. We've just concluded a very positive meeting.\nAnd I want to begin today by extending my thoughts and prayers for those affected by Hurricane Harvey and the catastrophe of flooding and all of the other difficulties that they're currently going through in Houston, in southeast Texas, and now it's looking more and more like the state of Louisiana will be also affected.\nMy administration is coordinating closely with state and local authorities in Texas and Louisiana to save lives, and we thank our first responders and all of those involved in their efforts.\nWe're working directly with Texas Governor Greg Abbott -- who, by the way, is doing a fantastic job -- and his entire staff, likewise, as well as with Governor John Bel Edwards, who's very much involved in starting the process of Louisiana. We've pledged our full support as Texas and Louisiana battle and recover from this very devastating and historic storm. There's probably never been anything like this.\nUnder the supervision of FEMA Administrator Brock Long, there has been a tremendous amount of work done. He has been so outstanding in so many ways. More than 8,500 federal workers are involved in the Texas effort alone. I've also today declared emergencies in Louisiana at the request of Governor Edwards.\nRecovery will be a long and difficult road, and the federal government stands ready, willing, and able to support that effort. Right now, the single most important thing is the safety and security of those still in harm's way, including the first responders who have been so terrific and brave. Protecting the lives of our people is my highest priority. Every asset at my command is at the disposal of local officials.\nTragic times such as these bring out the best in America's character. Strength, charity and resilience are those characters. We see neighbor helping neighbor, friend helping friend, and stranger helping stranger. And you see that all over. If you watch on television, you just see such incredible work and love, and teamwork.\nWe are one American family. We hurt together, we struggle together, and, believe me, we endure together. We are one family.\nTo the people of Texas and Louisiana: We are 100 percent with you. We're praying for you, we're working closely with your leaders and officials, and I will be visiting the impact zone tomorrow to ensure that you're receiving full support and cooperation from the federal government. And on Saturday, we think we're going back to Texas, and also we will be going to Louisiana.\nNothing can defeat the unbreakable spirit of the people of Texas and Louisiana. Right now, every American heart sends its love and support to those whose lives have been upended -- totally upended -- totally -- by this very horrible storm.\nWe ask God for his wisdom and strength. We will get through this. We will come out stronger. And, believe me, we will be bigger, better, stronger than ever before. The rebuilding will begin, and in the end it will be something very special. And I just want to thank everybody in the affected area, because it has been absolutely incredible to watch -- the spirit, the cooperation, and the love.\nI would also like to share a message to the people of Finland who have recently suffered a terrorist attack in Turku: We stand in solidarity with you against the terrorist threat. We must all work together to deny terrorists safe havens, cut off their finances, and defeat their very wicked ideology.\nMr. President, Americans are grateful for your steadfast support as an ally in the fight against terrorism -- appreciate it -- including your membership in the coalition to defeat ISIS. Finland makes important contributions to the coalition and its effort in Afghanistan, and has troops on the ground in Iraq training Iraqi soldiers.\nIn Afghanistan, Finland provides troops and financial contributions to support the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces on a modern-day frontier between barbarism and civilization. That's what you have -- it's barbarism versus civilization. We are particularly grateful to the Finnish citizens who have sacrificed for our mutual security.\nFinland is a leading expert in cybersecurity. In fact, we should be calling you pretty soon. You do do a fantastic job with cybersecurity, and I congratulate you. And I think in a very short period of time, we're going to be right there with you, believe me. The United States is a very proud partner of Finland's European Center of Excellence to counter modern threats, including cyberattacks.\nIn addition, we look forward to your leadership as chair of the Arctic Council. The Arctic region has strategic and economic importance for both of our nations -- very much so.\nThe foundation of our friendship is our shared love of freedom. On behalf of all Americans, I congratulate you and the Finnish people on the 100th anniversary of Finland's independence -- 100 years. Fantastic.\nIn honor of Finland's centennial, the United States is contributing an additional half-million dollars to the Fulbright Finland Foundation. Through the Fulbright program, we are sending more of our best and brightest to Finland, forging lasting connections between Americans and Finns.\nOn the economic front, we seek fair and reciprocal trade to benefit both of our countries. I applaud Finnish companies for their commitment to increase investment in the United States, adding new technologies and adding good jobs for hardworking Americans. Thank you.\nThe U.S.-Finnish partnership is rooted in our shared interests and common values. As President -- and I must say, and I want to thank you, President -- we've discussed and we look forward to further strengthening these bonds of culture, commerce, and cooperation between our two countries so that our citizens and our nations can thrive and prosper together.\nMr. President, I'd like to thank you very much for being at the White House and a great meeting in the Oval Office. It's my honor to have you here. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: Mr. President, I want to thank you for your very kind words. And I just want to tell you that it is a great pleasure and honor to be here today. I thank you also for the discussions we have had. They have been of most interest.\nWe have been closely following Hurricane Harvey. Our thoughts are with the people of Texas and Louisiana. They and you, Mr. President, have shown strength and courage to overcome this catastrophe. It has been touching to watch the TV and see how people help each other. That is what we basically are built of -- helping each other.\nFinland highly appreciates our close relationship with the United States. Today, they are broader than ever, ranging from security to defense cooperation, to trade and innovation. We are indeed celebrating our 100 years of independence. I want to thank you for the generous gift presented to the Fulbright Finland Foundation.\nI want to also take this opportunity to greet the almost 700,000 Americans who have Finnish origin. Mr. President and I exchanged views on several international issues. Our broad headline was security. We discussed the importance of the transatlantic bond between the European Union and the United States. History has taught us Europeans the value of unity.\nThe U.S. and NATO presence in Europe are -- and in Baltic Sea -- are most important, and they are increasing rapidly. Finland is doing its part. We promote dialogue. To reduce risks, Finland has proposed steps to improve flight safety in the Baltic Sea area. They are small, but positive steps in reopening dialogue between NATO and Russia. We remain committed to supporting Afghanistan, and we are a dedicated member of the global coalition against ISIS.\nFinland took the chairmanship of the Arctic Council from the United States in May. We can't afford losing the pristine Arctic nature. Finland firmly believes that business and environment can both be winners in the Arctic. A good example is reducing black carbon.\nMr. President, I'm looking forward to even closer cooperation with you and your great nation.\nI want to thank you. Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: So we'll take a couple of questions. How about we go to Texas. Todd Gillman. Todd.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes.\nQ: I'm wondering what you can tell the people of Texas to expect in terms of long-term recovery efforts. And, in particular, you have been feuding with some key congressional leaders. You've also threatened a government shutdown, potentially next month, over border wall funding. Are these going to hamper long-term -- the funding that will be needed long term for recovery?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, Todd. I think that you're going to very rapid action from Congress, certainly from the President. And you're going to get your funding. It's a terrible tragedy. Your governor has been absolutely outstanding in the job he's done, and his entire staff.\nAnd I will say that -- I just spoke with Greg, and he is working like 24/7. We expect to have requests on our desk fairly soon, and we think that Congress will feel very much the way I feel. In a very bipartisan way -- that will be nice. But we think you're going to have what you need and it's going to go fast.\nTexas is a unique place. It's a great, great state, great people, and I think you you'll be up and running very, very quickly. Really, very quickly. So, yeah, I think you're going to be in fantastic shape. I have already spoken to Congress and everybody feels for you and feels for what you're going through. But at the same time, they have great respect -- even additional respect for the state, because you've handled it so well, so brilliantly.\nBut it's a long road. Still pouring, still a lot of rain. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. I've heard the words \"epic,\" I've heard \"historic\" -- and that's what it is. But you will have what you want, I think, very, very quickly.\nAnd, Todd, you can ask a question the President.\nQ: Sure, thank you. Does this situation make you reconsider the possibility of a government shutdown?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I think it has nothing to do with it, really. I think this is separate. This is going to go really very, very quickly. Again, I have spoken to many of the people we're talking about, and everybody feels the same way I do.\nQ: Thank you. And, Mr. President, I wanted to ask you: Your neighbor Russia has meddled in U.S. politics. They have a military exercise coming up in the next few weeks. In the Baltic, there are tensions over there. What kind of advice have you offered, and can you offer, to the United States in dealing with this adversary?\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: Sir, we are not feeling ourselves as advisors, but we are feeling ourselves as doing all what is possible to maintain peace. And that is what we are doing in Baltic Sea area too.\nWith the -- actually, you refer to a different kind military training, which is going to happen there. I have to tell you that a couple of weeks ago, I met President Putin, and there were media interested in why Chinese navy is having training together with Russians in Baltic Sea area. Putin answered that it is not a bloc, it is not against anybody. My answer was that we are also training in Baltic Sea with United States and Sweden, and it's not bloc, it's not against anybody.\nSo we have to be very careful that this huge training, huge military trafficking over politics doesn't cause any accidental problems. Because we know that from accidents might grow whatever. And that is why I think it's important that we continue to work with NATO to enhance, like I said, dialogue between Russia and NATO. And it is going forward.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: You have a question?\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: Finnish Broadcasting Company. Where you are? Okay.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question to President Trump, if I may. As President Niinistö told, he's been raising the issue about the security situation in the Baltic region and the Baltic Sea, specifically, and has been concerned about the Russian planes flying there without transponders on. So my question to you, Mr. President, would be: Mr. Trump, would you consider Russia as a security threat? Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I consider many countries as a security threat, unfortunately, when you look at what's going on in the world today. As you know, a few weeks ago our great Vice President, Mike Pence, who's right here, was in the region and spent quite a bit of time there. We consider that a very, very important part of the world. We have great relationships there. We have a great relationship with Finland.\nAnd so I would consider many countries threats, but these are all threats that we'll be able to handle if we have to. Hopefully, we won't have to handle them, but if we do, we will handle them.\nQ: Can I have a follow-up, as he had also? So if the situation in the Baltic were to escalate, what would the U.S. be ready to do in that unfortunate circumstances? Thanks.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we are very protective of that region. That's all I can say. We are very, very protective. We have great friends there, great relationships there. We are extremely protective. Okay? Thank you.\nQ: Thank you, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: A question for the President? Yes.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: No. Sometimes he --\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Do you have a question for the President? Do you have a question for the President?\nQ: What if --\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: It's all right. Somebody else could.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: You don't have to. (Laughter.)\nQ: Mr. President, (inaudible) from Finland.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: Okay.\nQ: Did you speak about climate change at all? And what about your, Mr. President Niinistö, initiative about cleaning up the Arctic and doing it together with the United States? What kind of response did your idea receive here in Washington, D.C.?\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: We discussed a lot about black carbon. And to explain to everybody: What happens is that, from atmosphere, black carbon covers the Arctic, and we know what happens when sunshine meets black. It melts the ice. And the problem is not only Arctic; if we lose the Arctic, we lose the globe. That is reality.\nSo we must fight against those emissions spreading black carbon. I understood that the United States is going to put it in half, and we know that black carbon sources are a lot of them in Russia. They are old-fashioned energy plants producing heating. The other problem is flaring. You know that in oil fields, they flare up the extra gas, and the amount is huge. Yearly, they flare 40 times more than Finland spent gas.\nSo if we can -- and here comes also a business picture -- it would be a good business to renew those old-fashioned plants, to make more with less energy. It would be the business to stop flaring, to take use of that gas which is now burned (inaudible).\nAnd I think that these elements are shots that we can continue discussing in Arctic Council. We have inherited the chairmanship from the United States, and we continue the work.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: We had a very good discussion, in particular on the Arctic and black carbon. And I think we have much in agreement.\nOne of the things we also agree on: We want crystal-clean water, and we want clean air -- the cleanest ever. Very important. So we have a lot of agreement.\nJohn Roberts, yes.\nQ: Mr. President, thank you so much. President Niinistö, I have a question for you as well, but if I could start with President Trump. In the middle of Hurricane Harvey hitting on Friday night, you chose to pardon former Sheriff Joe Arpaio. I wonder if you could tell us what was behind your thinking for issuing the pardon for the Sheriff. And, as well, what do you say to your critics, even some in your own party, who say it was the wrong thing to do?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, a lot of people think it was the right thing to do, John. And actually, in the middle of a hurricane, even though it was a Friday evening, I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally. You know the hurricane was just starting, and I put it out that I had pardoned, as we say, Sheriff Joe.\nHe's done a great job for the people of Arizona. He's very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration. He is loved in Arizona. I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him right before the election voting started, as you know. And he lost in a fairly close election. He would have won the election, but they just hammered him just before the election. I thought that was a very, very unfair thing to do.\nWhen I mentioned him the other night -- you saw the massive crowd we had. The people went crazy when I said, \"What do you think of Sheriff Joe?\" or something to that effect. The place went absolutely crazy when I was in Arizona last week.\nAnd as far as pardons are concerned, I actually did this just before the meeting because I assumed that somebody would ask me the question. I didn't know it would be you, as you can attest. You didn't even know you were going to be called. But I thought I would. And, you know, Sheriff Joe is a great veteran of the military, great law enforcement person, somebody that's won many, many elections in the state of Arizona. But I wanted to look at some of the other people that were pardoned over the years.\nAnd if you look at, as an example, President Clinton pardoned Marc Rich, who was charged with crimes going back decades, including illegally buying oil from Iran while it held 53 American hostages -- wasn't allowed to do that, selling to the enemies of the United States. He was pardoned after his wife donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clintons.\nThen you have dangerous criminals. President Clinton pardoned Susan Rosenberg, a member of the Weather Underground, charged as part of a bank robbery that led to a guard and two police officers being killed.\nDrug dealers. President Clinton commuted the sentence of Carlos Vignali, a central player in a cocaine ring that stretched from California to Minnesota.\nCriminal leaker. You've heard the word \"leaker.\" President Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who leaked countless sensitive and classified documents to WikiLeaks, perhaps and others. But a horrible, horrible thing that he did. Commuted the sentence and perhaps pardoned.\nPresident Obama commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera, who was charged as part of a violent independence group from Puerto Rico, responsible for 28 Chicago-area bombings and many deaths in the 1970s and 1980s.\nSheriff Joe is a patriot. Sheriff Joe loves our country. Sheriff Joe protected our borders. And Sheriff Joe was very unfairly treated by the Obama administration, especially right before an election -- an election that he would have won. And he was elected many times.\nSo I stand by my pardon of Sheriff Joe, and I think the people of Arizona, who really know him best, would agree with me.\nThank you very much.\nQ: Mr. President, I'd like to claim prescience that you did all the research, but I'm afraid I have to confess the question was fairly obvious.\nAnd President Niinistö, I'm sure that President Trump either briefed you today, or you're aware of his new plan for Afghanistan that really relies, at its core, in bringing the Taliban to the table for negotiations. Given the history and the ideology of the Taliban, do you ever believe that they would honor any kind of an agreement that was ever made? Or would they, when the United States and Finland and other countries leave Afghanistan, renege on that deal?\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: Yes, first of all, I want to underline that Finland has been involved from the very beginning to all the attempts to solve the situation in Afghanistan. We have troops there. We have also financial aid going on all the time.\nWe have to try. We have to try in all possible ways to solve the situation in Afghanistan. It has been ongoing quite a long time, for decades. But to solve it by negotiations, surely you have to have full respect to the one you negotiate, and to also full believe that what is negotiated is also fulfilled.\nThese elements have to be all the time present when you discuss with whichever party in Afghanistan.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: I know there might be a couple of more questions, but do you want to take one more? Would you want to take one more? Go ahead, pick. (Laughter.) Go ahead.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: Please.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Again? You're going to give her the same one?\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: No, she's not the same lady. (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Go ahead.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: They are sitting side-by-side.\nQ: We have a lot of blonde women in Finland.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Go ahead.\nQ: Mr. President Trump, what kind of role do you see as Finland having in the U.S.-Russia relations? Do you think Finland could be of assistance, helping U.S. get better relations with Russia?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I hope that we do have good relations with Russia. I say it loud and clear, I've been saying it for years: I think it's a good thing if we have great relationships, or at least good relationships with Russia. That's very important, and I believe someday that will happen. It's a big country, it's a nuclear country, it's a country that we should get along with, and I think we will eventually get along with Russia.\nFinland is respected by Russia. Finland has been free of Russia, really -- just about one of the few countries in the region that has been -- for 100 years. And Russia has a lot of respect for Finland, so that's always good. But I think Finland is doing fine with Russia, and I hope that the United States will someday be able to have a very good relationship with Russia also. I think that's very good for world peace and for other things.\nThank you.\nQ: As a follow-up, if Finland's relationship with Russia were to deteriorate, would the U.S. -- what kind of assistance would the U.S. be willing to give to Finland bilaterally, if we needed it?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, as I said before, that, you know, our relationship with Finland is a very close one and we're always ready to help Finland. One of the things that is happening is you're purchasing large amounts of our great F-18 aircraft from Boeing, and it's one of the great planes, one of the great fighter jets, and you're purchasing lots of other military equipment, and, I think, purchasing very wisely. I know all of the military equipment and I actually agree with everything you purchased. We talked about it before.\nI think Finland is really a respected country militarily. It's got large armed forces for its size as a country. Really, proportionally, probably one of the biggest in the world if you think of it.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: I guess so.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: But they're very respected militarily, and they're respected beyond militarily. So hopefully it will never come to that. Thank you.\nQ: And President Niinistö? President Niinistö, did you discuss Russia? And did you offer any assistance to the U.S. with their relationship with Russia?\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: Well, like I said earlier on, we did discuss about Russia. But actually, I don't feel myself or Finland being any advisor to anybody, but we try to do our best, and hopefully we get also results from that.\nI want to remind you that, in NATO meeting, a year ago approximately, it was stated by all NATO countries that with Russia you have to be deterrence, but you have to exercise dialogue too. These two-way elements have to be there.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. Trey Yingst with One America News. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, do you believe that cutting FEMA's budget is the right thing to do?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: No, I think what's going to happen is the FEMA money is relatively small compared to the rebuilding money. So FEMA -- right now, we have the money necessary for Texas and Louisiana, if we need, but the real number, which will be many billions of dollars, will go through Congress. I think it'll happen very quickly, it'll go very fast, and I want to congratulate you on the network. It's a great network.\nQ: Thank you. If I may follow up on one other question from earlier -- the southern border wall. Is your plan still to have Mexico pay for the wall?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes, they will. One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. That's right. It may be through reimbursement, but one way or the other, Mexico will pay for the wall.\nWe're right now negotiating NAFTA. In my opinion, Mexico has been very difficult, as they should be. Why wouldn't they be? They had a sweetheart deal for so many years. It's one of the great deals of all time for them. One of the worst trade deals ever signed. I guarantee you, Mr. President, Finland would never have signed NAFTA with Russia or whoever you wanted. This is not a deal that you would want to sign. This is not a deal that Finland would know about.\nNAFTA is one of the worst trade deals ever signed at any time, anywhere in the world. And I can understand why Mexico is being difficult because why wouldn't they be? They've had it their way.\nBut, no, Mexico will pay for the wall. It may be through a reimbursement. We need the wall very badly. As you know, Mexico has a tremendous crime problem -- tremendous -- one of the number two or three in the world. And that's another reason we need it. And the -- just to add on, tremendous drugs are pouring into the United States at levels that nobody has ever seen before. This happened over the last three to four years in particular. The wall will stop much of the drugs from pouring into this country and poisoning our youth.\nSo we need the wall. It's imperative. We may fund it through the United States. But ultimately, Mexico will pay for the wall.\nQ: Sir, if I may follow up. On Tuesday, you said, if we have to close down our government, we are building that wall.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I hope that's not necessary --\nQ: If Mexico is paying for wall, why would you close down our government?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Let me just tell you -- yeah, I hope that's not necessary. If it's necessary, we'll have to see. But I hope it's not necessary. The wall is needed from the standpoint of security. The wall is needed from the standpoint of drug -- tremendous, the drug scourge, what's coming through the areas that we're talking about. As you know, I have General Kelly here. We stopped traffic coming through -- 78 percent. It's going to be, I think, 81 percent this quarter, which is a record. In other administrations, if they stopped it just a little bit, like one, or two, or three percent, they considered that a great thing. We're up to almost 80 percent. We'll soon be over 80 percent.\nBut you need the wall to do the rest, and you need the wall for the drugs. The drugs are a tremendous problem. The wall will greatly help with the drug problem, and ultimately that's a good thing for Mexico also. We have a very good relationship with Mexico, but I will say that dealing with them -- I've always said -- I've talked about NAFTA, you've heard me many times -- and I've said that we will either terminate it or renegotiate it.\nWe're in the process of renegotiating -- right now renegotiating the deal. I believe that you will probably have to at least start the termination process before a fair deal could be arrived at because it's been a one-sided deal. And this includes Canada, by the way. Great respect for Canada, great love for Canada, but it's been a one-sided deal for Canada and for Mexico.\nAnd the United States workers, all of these incredible people who have lost their jobs because of NAFTA, they're not going to be suffering any longer. It's been unfair for too long.\nSo we will build the wall, and we will stop a lot of things, including the drug -- the drugs are pouring in at levels like nobody has ever seen. We'll be able to stop them once the wall is up.\nThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ: Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-08-28", "title": "The President's News Conference with President Sauli Niinistö of Finland"}
{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128138", "text": "Q: We are really honored right now to have with us on the telephone, the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence. Thank you so much for being with us, and we want to get right to it and ask you about this federal declaration -- disaster declaration. Talk to us a little about what that means; what the federal government is willing to do to try and help us out here in Houston.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, first, let me thank you, and let me thank this station, and all the great local media that has been working, I know, around the clock, to get real time information to those that are struggling in the aftermath of landfall for Hurricane Harvey and now dealing with the historic flooding.\nI can tell you that the hearts of every American and I can assure you, the President and myself, and our entire administration are all in Houston, and we're with you.\nAnd the disaster declaration you referred to, the President actually signed on Friday night before Hurricane Harvey made landfall. And, what it did was free up an enormous amount of federal resources.\nWe currently have more than 8,500 officials on the ground, our FEMA director is there. The President and the First Lady will be on the ground tomorrow, in Texas, to see firsthand about the progress of our response. We have dozens of Coast Guard helicopters and fixed-wing working with first responders.\nWe just commend Governor Abbott, we commend local officials in Houston and all of those that are reaching out and making every effort. We know it has saved lives. We grieve the loss of life that has occurred. But to see the effort by local first responders and state and local officials, to see the way volunteers have poured forth with vehicles and small boats to help neighbors and friends -- Texas is truly inspiring the nation.\nQ: And yeah we appreciate those words, and President Trump has similar words just a little while ago when we listened into a press conference. So, as you mentioned, he is expected to visit the Corpus Christi area tomorrow with the First Lady. Can you share any more goals of that visit when he gets on the ground and what we might expect of that trip tomorrow?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, to know President Trump is to know a hands-on leader, someone who has high expectation. And really, from the time that Hurricane Harvey first made landfall, the President has been in continuous contact with Homeland Security and every agency of the national government that has been deployed to be with the people of Texas and with the people of Louisiana.\nAs you know, the President signed an emergency declaration this morning for Louisiana and has been in touch today with, I know, governors of both those states. And what I can tell you is that our Cabinet met over the course of this weekend. President Trump has been driving forward.\nWe're encouraged by the progress that's been made by the efforts that state and local officials have made with support of federal officials to deal with the storm and the flooding. But we know there is a long way to go, we are not out of the woods.\nAnd so the President wanted to be there on the ground to see firsthand the progress that's been made, and also to make sure that every agency of the federal government is doing everything in their power to move people out of harm's and then, also, begin the long process of recovery that the people of Houston, the greater area of southeast Texas will be dealing with for some time.\nAnd the President wants to assure families that are affected that they have our prayers, but they have the steadfast support of this administration at every level, as well as the outstanding work of state and local officials, and leaders, and first responders to see our way through this and recover and rebuild southeast Texas -- as the President said today -- better and stronger than ever before.\nQ: Yes, we need prayers and manpower for certain. I know there was an effort today by our governor to try and encourage people to right away begin the process of reaching out to FEMA.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well that's exactly right. And people would do well to reach out to FEMA directly. The phone number is 1-800-621-FEMA. People can also reach out to the disaster assistance website. As of this morning, we already had some 22,000 citizens who had contacted FEMA to begin the process of obtaining federal assistance that is available to Americans in these circumstances. It's DisasterAssistance.gov, if people are able to get to the Internet.\nWe think there may be as many as 500,000 people that will be eligible across the region for federal financial assistance. And if people think they are or might be, they can call that phone number, as I'm sure you've shared it, or go online at DisasterAssistance.gov to go ahead and register.\nBut I can assure you that, right now, the total focus of officials at the local level, first responders, and all of us partners at the federal level is on a rescue effort, getting people out of harm's way. And that will continue as the flood waters continue to rise, the rain continues to come down. But getting in front of the recovery effort, getting in front of the rebuilding effort, we encourage people to reach out to those resources and begin that process soon.\nQ: And I know you're watching a lot of the images coming out, specifically here in the Houston area, now that we are days and days into this. And even to us, and we're watching this around the clock, it's shocking to us to see this happening in our backyard. Just on a human level, what goes through your mind when you are seeing some of these images? And speak directly to the people of southeast Texas; what message do you have for them?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I can tell you that the message from President Trump and his family, and myself and my family, is that it just breaks our hearts to see the families struggling and suffering through this ordeal. And just want people to know that we are with you. We stand with you. The American people are standing with the people of Texas and Louisiana, as you go through this extraordinary ordeal.\nAs the President has said, we're all part of the same American family. When one hurts, we all hurt. And I can assure that we are not going to rest or relent in our efforts to see this rescue effort through. As the rain continues to come down and the flood waters rise, we'll be there. We'll be there with your first responders, with state and local officials. And long after the flood waters have gone, I can assure that your national government, the American people, are going to be with the people of Texas. And we will stand with the strong and resilient people of Texas as you rebuild southeast Texas better and stronger than ever before.\nQ: Absolutely. Vice President Mike Pence, we so appreciate you taking time out of your busy day to bring us your warm words and also some very applicable and (inaudible) tips for people who are going through a difficult time. Thank you so much.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. Thank you for having me on, and we are with you. The President and the First Lady will be there tomorrow, and we're going to see our way through this. God bless Texas.\nQ: Absolutely. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2017-08-28", "title": "Interview of the Vice President by KTRK-Houston"}

{"author": "Mike Pence", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128140", "text": "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good morning, Frank. This is Mike Pence calling from the White House.\nQ: Vice President, thank you so much for taking time to be with us this morning.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: No, thank you. And thank you for all that you've done, all this station has done to provide support and timely information to people that are enduring not only the landfall but now the incredible aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. I just -- the President and I have been deeply moved by the suffering that's taken place. But we've been inspired by the way the people of southeast Texas have come alongside their neighbors, the way state and local officials have responded, the way our first responders from the Coast Guard, to your National Guard, to local public fire and safety have put themselves literally in harm's way to save lives.\nAnd if I have one message to all of your listeners on behalf of the President and the entire federal government is the people of Texas should know we are with you, and the President and the First Lady will be in Corpus Christi today. My wife and I will be in southeast Texas later this week, and we're going to continue to provide all of the resources necessary to advance the efforts to rescue people that are enduring this storm. And also we'll be with you through the long, long recovery that awaits Texas.\nBut thank you for having me on.\nQ: Vice President Mike Pence with us this morning. I know you're an old radio guy.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I am.\nQ: Did you ever have any situations of disaster that you covered when you were a broadcaster?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Never on this scale. To see it from afar, Frank, has just been stunning I know for every American.\nBut when I was governor of Indiana, when I was working in the radio decades ago, we had our snowstorms. We had our tornadoes. We even had flooding. But to see the magnitude of this storm, the violence as it came ashore in your listening audience, and now to see the persistence of the rainfall that could be as much as 50 inches in the region -- never saw anything on this scale.\nBut I can tell you I was at FEMA yesterday getting a briefing on our team, and I hope everyone within the sound of my voice knows that the full resources of this national government at President Trump's direction -- beginning Friday night -- have been brought to bear on supporting state and local efforts, and that will continue to be the case until everyone in harm's way is rescued and everyone who is in need of assistance for recovery gets the financial support that the American people have made available to people in like circumstances.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, some of our outlying communities have just been utterly devastated, and we hear when these people call us, and they're just -- they're seeking information. They're -- I know these resources are starting to come in, but do you have any words for these people that are sitting there without power, without drinking water? They're trying to find services. The only method of communication is truly this radio station -- all six of our stations, iHeartMedia stations that we're streaming on -- do you have a message for these folks?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Our message to them is that it's important that they continue to listen to local officials, local emergency managers -- whether that's to shelter in place or to not return to affected areas. The most important thing now at every level of government is that we focus on saving lives and rescuing those that are in harm's way.\nBut they should know that help is on the way. As I speak to you, there's -- in addition to all of the extraordinary commitment, the activation of the entire Texas National Guard, first responders on the ground, we have more than 8,600 federal officials through FEMA on the ground. We've delivered more than 2.5 million meals, 2 million liters of water -- and with more on the way.\nThis is an unprecedented storm by every calculation, and I can assure you and assure each one of them that the continuous response of state, local, and federal officials is unprecedented as well; and we'll continue to lean into this effort.\nBut my most important message to them is that you're in our prayers. We'll continue to make every resource available. But please, please listen to local emergency management officials about how to conduct yourself and keep yourself and your family safe.\nQ: We're talking to Vice President Mike Pence with us this morning on iHeartRadio Corpus Christi, and we had the initial brunt of Hurricane Harvey here in the Coastal Bend. That storm was massive. It went on to bring these tremendous flooding rains to Houston and southeast Texas. And so the question starts to begin: The amount of resources that poured into our area -- do we start to see our resources go away? Or are there other resources that are heading to Houston? How do they split that up from a logistical standpoint? And what can we expect? Are we going to lose out? I don't want to say lose out to Houston because that's an incredible devastation and a whole lot of people affected. But how is that -- how does that separation of these resources, how does that go into play?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, first and foremost just know that, as will be evident when the President and the First Lady visit today and come to Corpus Christi, Corpus Christi we understand is the region where this made landfall. And the devastation that took place there, the displacement of families, those resources are continuing to flow -- from temporary housing for those that have been displaced, to shelter support. We have more than three dozen Coast Guard vehicles, helicopters and fixed-wings in the area; more than 100 shallow-water rescue boats; not counting literally the hundreds and hundreds of volunteers that have come to the area with their own watercraft to assist people. It's been incredibly inspiring.\nWe'll keep it in the forefront. And rest assured, we're very confident that federal emergency management reserves have more than sufficient funding to provide the initial response and all that FEMA is purposed to do. And we're also very confident that when Congress reconvenes next week that we'll be able on a bipartisan basis to seek any additional disaster assistance funding that maybe necessary for the families.\nAs of yesterday, Frank, we had more than 22,000 families go to disasterassistance.gov to begin to initiate an application for support and for services in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. We encourage people if they can to go to that website and begin that process. There may be as many as a half a million Texans who are eligible for financial support. They go to disasterassistance.gov or check in with FEMA at 1-800-621-FEMA to begin that process.\nBut again, that's all about recovery. And just be assured, Frank, before I was Vice President and governor, I was a member of Congress for 12 years. And I can assure you that the heart of our national government -- the Congress of the United States and this White House -- will work in concert, will work quickly. And we'll make sure the financial support is available for everyone affected by Hurricane Harvey.\nQ: Thank you for that. And our Congressman Blake Farenthold was in here a little bit earlier, and he reiterated that, as well.\nAnd we thank you, sir. And I know you mentioned that you all are keeping us in your prayers and the state of Texas in your prayers, and I want you to know that there's a lot of people in Texas that are keeping yourself and your family and the President in their prayers, as well. And we appreciate your service, and I know you're busy. And we thank you very much for your time to come on and talk to the Coastal Bend this morning.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, Frank, it's just -- let me say again, literally, we've been on our knees for the families affected by this storm. And we know we're not out of the woods. People within the sound of my voice should know that this is still a dangerous storm. Life-threatening flooding will continue to occur, and they need to heed the voices of local officials that they're hearing on the airways of your station.\nAnd let me lastly just say, thank you for being there for this community in this hour of need. This is a special radio station. Thank you for your commitment and the heart, if I may say, that you've shown for this community.\nWe'll get through this. Texans are tough, and we'll all work together. But it's a great, great testament to this radio station's commitment to the community that you've provided this public service. And God bless you for it.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. We appreciate your time this morning. Thank you, sir.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: All right, bye-bye now.", "timestamp": "2017-08-29", "title": "Interview of the Vice President by KKTX, Radio 1360"}

Let me ask you first and foremost, your assessment not just as the Vice President of the United States but as a citizen of this great country -- your assessment so far on the rescue and the recovery job being done by the governor of Texas, Mr. Abbott, the state of Texas, in conjunction with the federal government.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, good morning, Charlie. Thank you for having me on WOAI. Can I just begin by complimenting this radio station and you?\nQ: Absolutely.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you so much for the way that this station has leaned into this effort to provide timely information to people all across the region. It's the very best of public service, and we commend you for it. We truly do.\nI would rate -- and were President Trump on the phone with you this morning, we would rate Governor Abbott's leadership, and the efforts of state and local officials, and especially your first responders as excellent.\nThis is an unprecedented storm. We've been deeply moved by the suffering that we all have witnessed as Americans. But we've been equally inspired by the way that your leadership from the state on down -- and the volunteers -- the literally armada of volunteers that have made their way with watercraft, large and small, oftentimes into harm's way, to support efforts to rescue your fellow citizens and in most cases complete strangers. It's been very inspiring.\nAnd my message to all of your listeners and to people of Texas is that we are with you. As we speak, there are more than 8,600 federal officials through FEMA that are on the ground working to support the response in Texas and Louisiana. We've already shipped more the 2.5 million meals, more than 2 million liters of water. We have more than three dozen Coast Guard fixed-wing and helicopter aircraft, more than a hundred shallow-water rescue boats that have been working in the area for several days in conjunction with local first responders, your Texas National Guard.\nAnd the focus right now, Charlie, is completely on rescue. We recognize that we're not out of the woods. This is still a very dangerous storm.\nAnd anyone within the sound of my voice should know that as this storm continues to pound Texas and Louisiana that there will continue to be life-threatening flooding and that people need to continue to listen very carefully to local emergency managers and officials. And we will continue to focus on keeping people out of harm's way and rescuing people that find themselves in dire circumstance.\nQ: We are visiting with the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence. Mr. Vice President, obviously a lot of challenges -- you hit on a couple of them right there. From where you sit, what's the most challenging aspect of this situation?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I think the work that is being done on the ground has been exceptional by state and local officials. And I was at FEMA yesterday, Charlie, and got a full briefing. We literally have hundreds of FEMA personnel representing every government agency and most non-profits that are already working in the area like Red Cross and Samaritan's Purse and others.\nIt's all-hands-on-deck, but I think for every American what's frustrating is how relentless this storm continues to be and the sheer magnitude of it, which is historic in its proportions. But the will of the American people and the resilience of the strong people of Texas is stronger than any storm, and people should know that we are with you now. We're focused on rescue.\nBut very soon when the flood waters recede, they can be confident in Texas and in areas affected in Louisiana that the American people, through the federal government and your state and local officials -- we'll see Texas and the entire region all the way back, as the President said, stronger than ever before, but it's going to be a long haul. But right now -- right now, Charlie, it's all about saving lives.\nQ: Well, you're well aware as well that the media politicizing this event with a lot of unnecessary rhetoric, including it's the administration's first real test -- whatever that means. I'm sure that you, the President, and the administration are looking at this as anything but a test.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I think from Friday night, when the President took the unusual action of declaring an emergency before a hurricane made landfall, I can assure you that our entire administration has been completely engaged. The President has been in continuous contact. He assembled the Cabinet twice over this weekend. All we are focused on is protecting lives and laying a foundation for a full and robust recovery for southeast Texas after this storm.\nI mean, there will be a lot of time to talk about this storm and a lot of time to talk about the efforts that have been made in the future, but right now, I can you, from the President on down, we're all focused on the mission.\nAnd again, let me just say, we couldn't be more grateful for the leadership of Governor Greg Abbott. We couldn't be more inspired by your first responders at every level. And frankly, for me, looking at the volunteers that have been pouring forth, oftentimes putting themselves in harm's way to help a stranger, to help a neighbor, to go and come alongside the most vulnerable -- it's just, in many ways, in this very, very challenging time, this could well be Texas' finest hour.\nQ: What can you tell, quickly, Mr. Vice President, about the President's trip to Texas today?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, the President and the First Lady are in the air. They, frankly, were both very anxious to be there, to be with families. They'll be in Corpus Christi today. They'll also be getting a full briefing at the Emergency Operations Center.\nAnd I think the President -- to serve with President Donald Trump is to serve with a leader that is absolutely committed to making sure things are happening the way they're supposed to be happening. And so, the President wanted to get there not only to show solidarity with the families that are suffering in this storm but to make sure that all the federal agencies engaged are doing everything that can be done to rescue people and lay a foundation for full recovery.\nAnd let me also put a word in too -- we just couldn't be more grateful for the various volunteer organizations that have been on the ground since this weekend, Charlie. I spoke to the Red Cross myself this weekend. Samaritan's Purse is on the ground already, the Salvation Army, numerous church and faith-based organizations are already there with families, as you well know, in providing support and resources.\nThis is a challenge of such enormous magnitude that, as people remember the families that are affected in prayer, as all of us that are charged with public responsibilities lean into the effort of rescue and recovery, I sure do hope as many of listeners as can would maybe pick up the phone, go online, and find an organization that they can support financially that's out there putting the hands and feet and the compassion of the American people on the ground at the point of the need.\nQ: Thank you very much for your time, and I couldn't be more proud of my Vice President and President of the United States in this time.", "timestamp": "2017-08-29", "title": "Interview of the Vice President by WOAI, Radio 1200"}

I want to express my gratitude for our fellow Texans and especially the people of Corpus Christi for giving the President such a warm welcome on his ride over here, showing the gratitude that we all have for the President.\nI want to express my deep gratitude to the President for him and his entire Cabinet and staff for what they have done over the past couple of weeks. A lot of people see what happens in front of the camera. I want to reveal in just one minute what's been going on behind the scenes, behind the camera, for the past two weeks.\nAbout 10 days in advance of the hurricane even coming into the Corpus Christi area, members of the President's Cabinet and the President himself were in contact with me and my office pre-preparing for this catastrophe that was coming our way. And every step of the way, as the hurricane came across the shore, as the flooding began in Houston, Texas, the President and his Cabinet remained in constant contact with me and my staff. And they all had one thing to say: Texas, what do you need? How can we help? You can count on us.\nWhat I have learned is we can count on the President of the United States and his staff for helping Texas. Texas has been tested, but our response to this challenge has been made much more effective because of the very effective way the President and his staff has helped Texas respond to this challenge. So, Mr. President, thank you. Thank you. Welcome to Texas.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. That's so nice, Governor, and it's really my honor. This is a very special place in a special state. And Senator Cruz and Senator Cornyn, we thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. I know it was hard to get here for both of you -- you were trapped in various locations -- but we appreciate you both being here.\nI want to thank my staff, my Cabinet. We have quite a few of our Cabinet here. You know Ben Carson, obviously, from HUD, and Tom Price and Linda McMahon -- Small Business. Small business, which is now big business, because when you add them all up you're going to be helping a lot of the people in Texas and doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much, Linda.\nBut we have had a tremendous group of folks. Our Acting Director, Elaine, thank you very much for the job you've done. And a man who has really become very famous on television over the last couple of days -- Mr. Long -- we appreciate it very much. You have been just outstanding.\nAnd I can tell you that my folks were just telling me how great your representatives have been in working together. It's a real team, and we want to do it better than ever before. We want to be looked at in five years, in ten years from now as this is the way to do it.\nThis was of epic proportions. Nobody has ever seen anything like this. And I just want to say that working with the Governor and his entire team has been an honor for us. So, Governor, again, thank you very much. We won't say congratulations. We don't want to do that. We don't want to congratulate. We'll congratulate each other when it's all finished. But you have been terrific. Really terrific. It's a great honor. And you've been my friend, too, for a long time.\nAnd with that, maybe you could say a few words.\nADMINISTRATOR LONG: Thank you, Mr. President. So the whole community is coming together. You know, right here where the brunt of the Category 4 hurricane winds came in just north of Corpus Christi, we're already starting to effect recovery. Recovery is a slow process, but rest assured that we're doing everything we can to unify our efforts down to support the local responders, the first responders that we have here.\nYesterday, I put eyes on the ground down in Rockport. We already have points of distribution flowing. We're working in conjunction with the Governor's National Guard where FEMA is supplying meals and water, and the National Guard is helping to run those distribution points. That's how this system works. All eyes are on Houston and so are mine. We got a long way to go. We're going to have to set up expectations of the citizens that we're going to have to continue a unified effort down to help the state of Texas ultimately recover.\nSo, very quickly, the objectives stay the same. The event, unfortunately, to the north of us is not over. We're still in a lifesaving, life-sustaining mission. We're very aware of the issues at the Convention Center, but let me be clear: This is not the Superdome. The Convention Center -- we are sustaining food. They have food, we have security. I have an incident management team inside the city of Houston as we speak, and more and more people are being moved to shelters to stabilize the situation.\nThe next thing is, is that we're pushing commodities. Once the water goes down, we'll continue to push not only commodities but also help to get people registered in the system to receive assistance from all of us. You know, assistance doesn't just come from FEMA; it comes from many organizations who are represented here today by Secretary Price, Secretary Carson, and others.\nThe next thing is, is that we're looking at power restoration. We're maintaining security. You know, Ms. Duke, you've mobilized the Homeland Security Search Capacity Force. With that comes law enforcement to make sure that we're overcoming and anticipating any security needs that we have.\nAnd then also, with Secretary Price over here, we're working with not only the Governor's disaster medical teams but we're also sending federal disaster medical teams in, not only to the Convention Center today -- there's already some on site -- but there's going to be multiple areas, not only for crisis counseling but also to make sure that we're meeting access to functional needs.\nThe access is a challenge to getting all the supplies in, once the roadway systems come out. We've amassed quite the federal force to be able to support the local and state efforts. For example, the Governor pulls 12,000 National Guard troops in. We're pulling units out of Fort Hood as the federal government and federal DOD forces are coming in as well. We've pulled several hundred trucks and staff just from assets right here in the state of Texas, and that's how the system works.\nThis recovery is going to be frustrating. We're going to be here with you to help you guide through it. It's going to be tough to navigate all of the programs that become available, but we're here to help.\nSo with that, I'd like to pass it along to our friends at the Coast Guard.\nU.S. COAST GUARD PARTICIPANT: Mr. President, good afternoon, sir. This is where your Coast Guard serves at its best.\n(Inaudible.)\nU.S. COAST GUARD PARTICIPANT: (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I want to tell you, I can speak for the Governor because we spoke about it, and we're very proud of the Coast Guard -- the job you have done with the lives you've saved. We're very, very proud of you, and thank you very much.\nU.S. COAST GUARD PARTICIPANT: (Inaudible.)\nADMINISTRATOR LONG: Mr. President, before the press pulls out, there's information that I'd like to share in regards to how citizens can get involved -- so here again, it's the whole community. Neighbors helping neighbors is going to be needed in helping Texas overcome.\nSo very quickly, if you would like to register for assistance underneath the Governor's declared counties -- there's 18 declared counties for individual assistance underneath the President's disaster declaration. That's DisasterAssistance.org -- excuse me, DisasterAssistance.gov -- I apologize -- DisasterAssistance.gov. That's the FEMA individual assistance system.\nThere's also ways, if you're looking to volunteer: NVOAD.org -- N-V-A-O-D.org. There's also, within the state of Texas, OneStarFoundation.org and, I believe -- RedCross.org as well.\nSo thank you, and at this time we'll let the press pool leave.", "timestamp": "2017-08-29", "title": "Remarks at a Briefing on Hurricane Harvey Relief Efforts in Corpus Christi, Texas"}

We're honored to have you here in the Lone Star State. I wish it were not under these circumstances.\nBut we are able to be where we are today, in the aftermath of this catastrophic storm that we faced. And it's really been two storms: It was the hurricane that turned into one of the most immense floods ever suffered by the United States. People's lives have been on the line, and I've been able to see firsthand your care and your compassion for the people of Texas.\nI've had the opportunity -- for those who only get to see what happens on the front lines, you need to know what happens behind the scenes. And behind the scenes, the President has shown both care and compassion, and direction and commitment, from the very beginning when the storm was still way out in the ocean. You helped Texas get prepared, providing us every resource and tool that we needed so that we could have a plan to respond to the catastrophe that was coming. And then after the hurricane came onshore, and after the flooding began in Houston, we were in communication, either you and I almost every day, or you and myself and your tremendous Cabinet members who have bent over backwards to assist us.\nAnd then, on our flight from Corpus Christi to Austin, to see his genuine compassion, as we saw videos of what was going on in Houston, Texas, with the rising water and our fellow Texans suffering, the President was heartbroken about what he saw, and he's committed to ensuring that Texas will rebuild -- because that's the American way. We take care of each other. We've seen that with Texans helping Texans, with Americans helping Americans.\nAnd, Mr. President, we're stronger, better, and better prepared because of your leadership from the very beginning. And I want to thank you. (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: And I want to just say hello -- Elaine Duke is here someplace. Elaine, fantastic job. And Brock has been incredible. And from your standpoint, Nim and the whole group, and Steve, who I just met -- Steve -- and the job that they've done getting along. Number one, they like each other -- very important. And number two, they respect each other. And the job that all of these groups have done getting along is -- in terms of coordination, has been really incredible, and everyone is talking about it.\nThe sad thing is that this is long term. Nobody has ever seen anything this long, and nobody has ever seen this much water. The wind was pretty horrific, but the water has never been seen like this to the extent.\nAnd it's maybe someday going to disappear. We keep waiting. We have three of our great -- four of our great congressmen right here, and we really appreciate you being here. We're going to be working with Congress on helping out the state of Texas. It's going to be a costly proposition, because again, and probably -- Ted Cruz is here. And, Senator, thank you very much -- Senator Cornyn. And we'll be working with these characters over here -- (laughter) -- and I think we'll come through and really get the right solution.\nBut probably there's never been anything so expensive in our country's history. There's never been anything so historic in terms of damage and in terms of ferocity as what we've witnessed with Harvey. Sounds like such an innocent name, Ben, right? But it's not. (Laughter.) It's not innocent. It's not innocent.\nI also want to thank my people. And Ben Carson, as you know, is here from HUD, and Linda is -- Linda McMahon from Small Business. And I say this is not small business, Linda, this is big business. When you add it all up, you're going to be giving away many, many millions of dollars to help people out. And Tom Price, as you know is -- Dr. Tom Price -- you have your people in the field, Tom.\nIn fact, you may say a couple of words. And then I'll ask Linda and I'll ask Ben, and then I think we'll get on to Nim and to Brock and everybody.\nTom.\nSECRETARY PRICE: Sure. Thanks, Mr. President. As you said, this is a historic proportions storm and flood. The challenge that we have, obviously, is to get the resources to the individuals that are stranded right now, make certain that the evacuees have a place to go. From an HHS standpoint, our responsibilities are medical and veterinarian and mortuary. There will be of the above.\nThe challenge that we have in the long term is that most individuals who suffer from these suffer from not being able to get the medical care that they need after the -- when the sun comes out. So trying to make certain that we've got pharmacies staffed, make certain that dialysis units are up, make certain that folks are getting the electricity to their homes so the oxygen concentrators are able to be utilized. And then (inaudible) disease -- making certain the folks can get to their doctor when they are in their hometown and get the treatment that they need.\nBut we're staffed up and ready to go. We've got four federal medical stations that -- two are up and running and two on the way. And we've another four or five that are stationed after that, depending on where folks need --\nTHE PRESIDENT: And they're big ones.\nDR. PRICE: Yeah, yeah. We're here for you.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you, Tom.\nLinda.\nADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: Well, SBA has its disaster relief office in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, so we have 900 people there permanently. We have 600 available in the surge. There will be -- they're already coming in. I actually did get a note on the plane from Corpus that we made the first home loan approval from this disaster. So I was glad that we're already up and running.\nWe will be making home loans, business loans. We'll be making loans for those folks who have lost income, and also the opportunity to replace property and equipment and inventories. So we're up and ready to go.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. And Ben Carson from HUD.\nSECRETARY CARSON: Well, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for your leadership, and you, Mrs. First Lady, also. Currently, everything that's been done -- it's been great working with everybody. And, Governor, you're one of the people that I admire the most. (Inaudible.) Brock has done a fantastic job, and Elaine. Everybody that we've been working has been fantastic.\nAnd what we've been trying to do is make sure that we go from the phase of rescue and reaction to the phase of recovery and a smooth transition. We're also going to be assisting state and local governments in reallocation of federal assets to the disaster relief. We'll be granting immediate foreclosure relief; insurance -- mortgage insurance, as well as insurance for rehabilitation, through the Section 203(k) program, Section 108 of loan guarantees for infrastructure, for economic development, and for a host of things, and also disseminating information, which is so critical. The masses frequently become confused. We're working very hard to get rid of some of the regulatory burden so that we can get things gone really quickly. Linda and I will be working on that to make sure that we get what we need to the people.\nAnd I want everybody to know that we're in this for the long run, and know that once the water recedes, that's where our work really begins. And we're going to be (inaudible) until we finish.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Ben, very much. I appreciate it.\nSo, Nim, why don't you take over along with Brock, and we can through some of the different things that we're going to be doing.", "timestamp": "2017-08-29", "title": "Remarks in a Briefing with State Leadership on Hurricane Harvey Relief Efforts in Austin, Texas"}

SANDERS: Obviously, we've had a very powerful day, a strong day, mostly a very productive day with the President having the opportunity to sit down with a lot of state and local officials, and get some real-time updates, and talk to a lot of folks firsthand that are here and have been on the ground, and see how we can be of assistance as a federal government.\nThe number-one thing after talking to him just a little bit ago that he wanted to reinforce from today was that this is all about people and making sure that we're taking care of the people of Texas. And that's his number-one priority. That's what he has instructed his Cabinet is -- their number-one priority is just making sure we do everything we can to help and take care of the people. He was very impressed, and has been, with the level of, as he said, \"love\" and the \"spirit\" and the \"cooperation\" that you've had with so many different people, different agencies -- state, local, and federal officials.\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn it over to the Cabinet Secretaries and let them give you a quick update.\nQ: Can each person identify themselves for the people on the ground?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes, sir. So we can start here and we'll rotate around.\nACTING SECRETARY DUKE: Hi, I'm Elaine Duke, and I'm Acting Secretary at Department of Homeland Security. I just want to talk a little bit about our role. We have FEMA in our department, and so I'm supporting Administrator Brock Long and the response efforts currently going on and through recovery. In addition, we have several other of our operating components working on the response to the hurricane.\nWe have Coast Guard, which is doing quite a bit of search and recovery. They will be restoring the waterways, making sure the aids to navigation are there, anything that needs to be done to open the waterways.\nWe have, also, Customs and Border Protection that is aiding in the rescue. And we have a surge force of DHS employees -- about 1,000 persons that come out of their routine jobs and surge with FEMA to provide support. And those are some of the areas. We also have deployed law enforcement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and others to augment the law enforcement that's in the local area.\nQ: What's your biggest challenge at this point?\nACTING SECRETARY DUKE: Our biggest challenge right now is finishing the search and rescue, and then when the rains stop is getting people out of shelters and into transitional housing. You know, shelters should be used for as short a period as possible. So we're already starting the transitional housing for those that have been put out of their homes.\nQ: How much longer do you think the search missions will take?\nACTING SECRETARY DUKE: We expect the rains to end within the next 24 to 48 hours and then the water will start to go down. And we will continue looking, and until all the waters are gone, I really don't think we'll be completed with making sure we've accounted for everyone.\nQ: On the transitional housing front, what is your vision for that? Is this going to be something that will encompass several states? Or do you have a sense of how large of an area will be providing transitional housing?\nACTING SECRETARY DUKE: Yes, so transitional housing -- we try to keep people as close to their original homes as possible and get them back to their regular routine of life. So we could be looking at hotels, people sharing their homes. A lot of people have family that they can stay with. So our goal would be to keep them as close as possible to home, get schools reopened, those type of things, so people can start getting back to their regular pace of life as soon as possible.\nAnd then we would work with rebuilding and, if necessary, modular homes to help some people be able to stay in their land while we're rebuilding homes.\nQ: How many people do you expect to be under this sort of shelter?\nACTING SECRETARY DUKE: We don't know that yet. They apply through FEMA. I've heard about 20,000 people are in shelters -- the temporary shelters right now. That number is very fluid, but not everybody is in the shelter that will need transitional housing. So my guess is it will be much more than the number we see in the shelters. Some people will come back from wherever they're staying and look for help to get their homes repaired or rebuilt.\nQ: What are the biggest lessons that DHS, and especially FEMA, learned from Katrina and from Hurricane Sandy, and from these other really big storms that have happened in the past decade or so?\nACTING SECRETARY DUKE: I think the biggest lesson we learned was on having a continual relationship with our state and local partners. So, as you saw today, probably with our Region VI Director and Brock and his counterparts, it wasn't last Friday when we all just met each other. There are these regular relationships; we're working on them all the time with planning. So when we have to react quickly, the baseline is set and we're ready to go. And there's that partnership and that relationship that we can build on.\nAnd I think that was probably the number-one thing. And then also, coaching each other -- not just waiting for the state to ask or vice versa, but saying, hey, this is what we can do for you. And I think that's that relational part of planning together and being concerned about the people together.\nMS. SANDERS: Let's take one more question for Secretary Duke.\nQ: Do you think in the longer term there will be a need to appoint a coordinator to kind of run this when the initial attention ebbs away?\nACTING SECRETARY DUKE: We will have a lot of attention. So we will establish a joint field office, and that will have a federal coordinating official that we'll appoint. And their job will be to coordinate all that. We will have a major joint field office.\nIn addition, from leadership and the President, he has asked all of us to make sure that we're focused. Some of us have short- and long-term responses, others. But I think that having the people you have here today, we were just sitting up front talking about how we're going to work together over the next months to years. So we're not ending it with this plane ride today.\nThank you.\nADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: Hi, I'm Linda McMahon. I'm the Administrator for the Small Business Administration.\nSo our goal, obviously, is to get businesses reopened. But also this is a time when SBA for the first -- not the first time -- but also -- not also -- this is a time when SBA gets involved in home mortgages as well. Ordinarily, we do not. Our loans are really guaranteed for businesses. SBA, at this point, also makes the loans directly instead of guaranteeing a loan from the lender.\nSo the first step is to apply through FEMA. FEMA then makes a recommendation to send over a prospective small-business owner or homeowner that is looking for these loans to us. We then qualify them to make sure that they are able to repay the loan. And then, if that whole process turns out to be that we can then give them a loan, then we do. So the third one is processing the loan and getting their money to them.\nSo it's a three-step process, and you can go to SBA.gov and just click on the banner. That will take you right to the application site for the disaster loan.\nQ: Do you have enough money for what you need to do?\nADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: We have enough money to certainly get started for a good while. We'll have to see what the extent of the damages are, but clearly we are prepared to move forward with a substantial number of loans at this point.\nQ: Any preliminary assessment of how many businesses might be affected by the storm and what the scope of the needs might be?\nADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: We don't have that yet. It's just too early to tell. You know, SBA is really probably not in the recovery process so much as FEMA is, but SBA works lockstep with FEMA. As a matter of fact, when FEMA opens a district office, SBA will be in that office as well. So people can apply in person, they can apply online, or through the mail.\nQ: How do you know if somebody can pay back a loan if they've lost all their collateral, if they've lost their business?\nADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: Well, they must show an ability to repay the loan or we can't grant the loan.\nQ: What does that mean, though? If I've lost everything, then how can I show I can pay back the loan?\nADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: You will have to have a good credit score, and we also look at your tax transcript to see what your ability to pay would be.\nAnd also, SBA, in this loan process, is not just about plant property, equipment, and inventory, but also a loss of operating capital, up to a cap of $2 million.\nQ: Two million?\nADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: Two million. All total for all of that.\nAnd also, we provide up to $200,000 for homeowners and $40,000 for loss of property, even for renters -- personal property.\nQ: Sorry, Steve, you asked how big the pot was?\nQ: Yeah, if she had enough money, yeah.\nQ: How much money have you got on hand?\nADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: We have lending authority right now of over $3 billion. So we're good for now.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: Well, we'll see. We'll see. This is a devastating storm, so we're going to have to see. I couldn't answer that question now.\nQ: How long does the process usually take to get a loan?\nADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: Well, we had our first application on Sunday. We approved that homeowner's loan today. Now, that was very quick. Typically, as the volume increases, obviously it take longer. But our goal is to be able to process 100,000 applications in a 30-day period. As we gear up from the employees we have on-boarded now, which is about 900 and bringing in another 600 from our surge offices.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you so much, Administrator.\nADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: Thank you.\nSECRETARY CARSON: Okay, Ben Caron, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. And our role tends to be more in the recovery phase, but it's very important to be involved early on so that we have a relatively smooth transition.\nAlso, there are things that we can do early on, such as helping to reallocate, or helping the state and the localities to reallocate some of the federal resources directly to disaster relief. Also, immediate relief of foreclosure proceedings; providing mortgage insurance, providing insurance for mortgages and rehabilitation through the Section 203(k) program. Also, providing loans through the Section 108 guaranteed loan program for local infrastructure needs, for rehabilitation, for economic development. And also, assessing what apartments and other living facilities are available, and we share that information with FEMA and with all the other agencies in order to facilitate placement.\nAnd then, of course, our long-term aim is obviously to get people back into their homes, which means that there's going to be a lot of remediation after the water recedes, looking at mold and all kinds of conditions that make it very difficult for people to live. Obviously, we're going to be involved in the ground floor in getting those things done.\nQ: Is there enough space for all these people for housing?\nSECRETARY CARSON: There's always more space that can be had, and we're always looking for innovative ways in order to house people. But we will obviously, and we always do, come up with adequate space.\nQ: I'm sorry, just one more thing. When you reallocate assets from one place to another, do you risk hurting the place where the money started?\nSECRETARY CARSON: Well, there's no question that you have to prioritize. And when we have an emergency like this, perhaps some other things may not be quite as important.\nQ: What kind of budget priorities do you think might be made for housing in the expected request from the administration? There was like a zeroing-out of the Community Development Block Grant Program, which I understand was helpful for Katrina and Sandy victims.\nSECRETARY CARSON: Well, my conviction is no eviction, and I leave it at that. Obviously, we'll do what we need to do in order to make sure that that doesn't happen.\nSECRETARY PRICE: Tom Price, Secretary of Health and Human Services. I think that what today was, was really an inspiring visit to a devastated area. The spirit of the people of Texas is absolutely phenomenal. And what they understand is that it takes a partnership between the local, city, county, state folks, along with the federal government. And I think the message that the President delivered [is] one of absolute support for the individuals here in Texas.\nFrom an HHS standpoint, our mission right now continues to be life saving and rescue. Many hospitals are getting to the end of their power-generating capacity so that they continue to have electricity, and we've been making certain that they're getting replenishment of the fuel that's necessary. The same is true for nursing homes.\nThere have been about 30 hospitals that have closed in the area in Texas. All of those patients have been transferred to hospitals within the state. The state had capacity to be able to accommodate that.\nSome unique situations that people don't oftentimes think about is -- one is dialysis. Folks require dialysis -- usually if they have a renal failure -- twice a week, usually Monday-Thursday, Tuesday-Friday. So we're in a time period now when folks were dialyzed last week. Their dialysis time comes back up and they may not have had the facility available to them. So working with the companies that provide the dialysis, the entities that provide the dialysis, we've been able to move those individuals to places that could accommodate them.\nSame is true for folks with durable medical equipment -- oxygen concentrators and electric wheelchairs and those kinds of things -- to make certain -- well, what HHS does is identify where those people are or who they are, and then, in concert with the local government, let them know and so somebody can go out to the house or the apartment and make certain that they're doing all right.\nBut we're early in this. This is going to be a long, long duration. After, as somebody said, the sun comes out, we'll have a recovery phase that will last years, literally. And our goal at HHS to make certain that their health needs and human services needs are met.\nQ: How many hospitals, do you think, are still in jeopardy from the elements?\nSECRETARY PRICE: There were six or seven more hospitals this morning that were in the process of evacuating or partial evacuation. Now, it would -- I don't know that there are any more that, given the current flood pattern, that are going to be in jeopardy. The challenge is making sure that they are staffed up -- that they have medical staff. Obviously, many of these staff members have been working since Friday or Saturday. So one of the things that we have is disaster medical assistance teams that come in and are able to give folks relief and are able to fulfill some of that staff need.\nQ: Do you think you have enough beds now for the people who need care, or are you short significant beds?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Currently, all the capacity that was needed has been handled by the state of Texas -- within the state of Texas.\nQ: Based on your experience in Congress, what's the climate going to be like on Capitol Hill for spending requests for hurricane recovery?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Well, I think that Congress will recognize that this is a -- this has been described as a storm and flood of epic proportions, and that that they will respond to the needs of the American people.\nQ: Do you have any concerns about any particular waterborne diseases or any kind of conditions that would be affected by water quality as this water starts sitting around for longer?\nSECRETARY PRICE: Whenever you have standing water and this amount of water, that builds a stew that can harbor significant bacteria and marine challenges from an infection standpoint. CDC has guidelines for that and they're posted already, and we will work with the local communities to make certain that we're doing all that we can to mitigate the challenge.\nQ: Governor Abbott mentioned, when we were on the ground in Austin, that during the flight from Corpus Christi to Austin you guys had been looking at videos and so on of events in Houston, and that the President was heartbroken. Can you describe to us what was going on? Were you --\nSECRETARY PRICE: I wasn't in that cabin, but I will tell you that, in my conversations with the President and in my experience with the President, that his passion and his love for the American people and concern about their welfare is unending. And what he has seen in this is what all of us have seen when you watch the television and you see the situation -- the tragic situation that many individuals are in. And his heart goes out to them, as does everybody's heart.\nBut the Texan people and the people in Louisiana who are about to be challenged, and the American people have always risen to the occasion and will do so this time as well.\nThank you all.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you. All right, we'll dive right in. I'll take a couple questions. I'm sure you don't have anything left to ask. Since we had all the brilliant individuals back here answering all the really tough stuff, I'll take the easy ones now.\nQ: Are you expecting an emergency spending request to cover the hurricane funding? Or will it be attached to the CR or something else?\nMS. SANDERS: You know, I think that something they're still working through -- what the best mechanism is possible and what the best way is to make sure that the people of Texas get the funding they need.\nJust one quick update that I meant to mention on the top, and I know the President has mentioned it before, but we are definitely going back to Texas on Saturday and possibly Louisiana on Saturday as well, depending on the weather conditions there. We'll probably be going into a more southern part of the state and a different part of the state than we were earlier today.\nQ: Following up on Steve's question, you mentioned that the people of Texas will get the money that they need. Does the administration believe that that money should be offset in the budget somehow?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we're still I think working through that process. I think the first thing is to determine how much they need, what the need is, and then develop the best process and plan forward from there.\nQ: You've got no ideological, you know, guiding principle that it should be budget or revenue-neutral -- or budget-neutral, rather?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that the guiding principle here is taking care of Americans. I mean, that's the very core of who we are and that's something that the President has been very clear about. And when we have people in our country that are facing the type of devastation that Texas and possibly Louisiana are, then we want to step up and be able to play a part in that.\nQ: Just a follow-up on that. You know, we haven't really heard -- this hasn't been something that the President has had to take a position on in the past, but the Vice President did, as a House member, when he did demand offsets to pay for Katrina aid. Is that part of the discussion? Is there potentially going to be the demand from the administration? Or does this administration -- is that not in the picture?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we're at the very beginning stages of this process. We're working through and reviewing the best steps forward. And when we have specific details and we've had time for members of our administration to sit down with members of Congress and work through what that looks like, we'll certainly let you guys know.\nQ: Was the President concerned with the emails that were revealed yesterday where Michael Cohen, a longtime Trump executive, was emailing Dmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary, about a project in Russia? And is he afraid that's going to spark any sort of investigation by Bob Mueller into his company?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at all. I mean, I think it's pretty clear that there's really nothing there to this story, nothing to move forward. The President at that time was very focused on his campaign, and that was the priority he had at the time, and so certainly not something I believe he's at all concerned about.\nQ: Was he aware that Michael Cohen sent that email?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure.\nQ: The President's campaign send out an email to encouraging supporters to donate themselves to these relief efforts. Has the President made any personal donations to like the Red Cross or any kind of charity organization?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll have to check into that and let you know.\nQ: Back on the budget -- the President today said in Austin that this looks like the most expensive recovery in history. What's he basing that on? Is it going to be more expensive than Katrina or Sandy or --\nMS. SANDERS: I think some of the preliminary reports indicate it could be. And we're certainly still, as you know and as you guys are very well aware as you're reporting, we still don't know the full extent to the damage, but we certainly know it's record-level flooding and an epic storm, and is certainly going to be a lot of rebuilding and recovery that's going to come from that and potentially the largest we've ever seen. And there are a lot of estimates that put it there, and we'll have to get deeper into the weeds to finalize that and see what that looks like.\nQ: Was there a reason the President didn't talk that much about the people who were actually killed in the storm, the people who were displaced, who have been left homeless? It seemed like the focus was more on making sure the federal government was working well with state and local officials. And could you speak to just what his reaction was when he saw the images in Houston? It sounds like he watched some of that on the plane.\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think you could deny the powerful effects that some of the images that we've seen over the past couple of days. Certainly something that I know is very moving both to the President and the First Lady. One of the reasons she really wanted to be part of the trip today. I think he's made very clear the priority is taking care of the people and doing whatever we can, but also letting the state and local officials take the lead in that process. And we're going to continue doing everything we can from our side to help in that.\nQ: North Korea, there's obviously -- like dramatically provocative missile test yesterday. Does the U.S. have any plans to move assets into the region that are not part of U.S. forces Korea or THAAD that's already being semi-deployed?\nMS. SANDERS: As we have announcements on that, we'll certainly let you guys know. As you know, the President doesn't like to broadcast any movements. And when he's ready to make those, we'll keep you guys posted.\nQ: Do you think the North Koreans are testing the President?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm sorry?\nQ: Do you think the North Koreans are testing the President?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm probably not the military mind you want to ask that. I'll leave that to the Department of Defense to answer.\nQ: The President had said previously that any further provocation would be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen before. Does he consider that was provocation? I mean, what's happening?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, we're reviewing the actions by them and we'll keep you posted on next steps from here. But I think our statement was clear last night that all options are on the table.\nQ: Well, I was going to ask about that. What does he mean when he says all options are on the table?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that means all options are on the table. I think that's pretty clear, Steve.\nQ: Sarah, on immigration -- what is the President's current thinking on the DACA program? And should people who -- young men and women who are covered by that program be fearful right now that they could be deported?\nMS. SANDERS: That's something that's under review. And again, a final decision hasn't been made, and when it is, we'll certainly announce it.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMS. SANDERS: We'll keep you posted. Until the review is totally completed and a decision is made, I can't weigh in on a timeline.\nQ: Can you describe the President's reaction to Secretary Tillerson's comments on Sunday about American values? He seemed to suggest that the President didn't share the values of most Americans.\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President certainly shares the values of Americans. I think that's why he's the President -- because of overwhelmingly a large number of Americans came out and voted for him because he does reflect their values. They feel like he speaks for them. And I think that the President's relationship with the Secretary of State is very strong. They're committed and continue to work together and move our policies and agenda forward.\nQ: Did those comments bother the President?\nMS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of.\nQ: What about Gary Cohn? Do his comments and his interview with The Financial Times last week and just kind of continuing to speak out and make clear that he was dismayed by the Charlottesville reaction -- is that upsetting the President at all?\nMS. SANDERS: The President and Gary are both committed to working on tax reform. We're going to Missouri tomorrow to talk specifically about that. Gary will be part of that trip. They're both very committed to working together to make sure the country gets the tax relief that they need, particularly the middle class.\nQ: Do you think it's unusual for sitting Cabinet Secretaries and administration officials to try to distance themselves from the President they work for?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think anyone has tried to distance themselves. I think that at moments maybe you have people that disagree. I think that's a healthy thing for you to be able to have productive conversation. And certainly no one is distancing themselves from the President. But as I said, Gary will be traveling with the President tomorrow talking about tax reform. We got an aggressive agenda moving into the fall, and he'll play a big role in that.\nI'll take one more.\nQ: Has the President discussed Gary Cohn's Financial Times interview with him -- the comments that he made?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure about that, Steve.\nAll right, thanks guys.\nQ: On Saturday -- What's the purpose of the trip Saturday?\nMS. SANDERS: To go back into a different part of the state and have the chance to see some of the areas we weren't able to today. One of the priorities the President had was making sure that his trip today didn't disrupt any of the recovery or search- and-rescue efforts. And this will allow him to go into a part of the state that was hit really hard, and so he'll have the chance to meet with some of the evacuees as well.\nQ: Is he going to stay in Washington --\nQ: (Inaudible) tomorrow a little bit and just talk about what is --\nMS. SANDERS: They did a background briefing earlier, and I'll make sure you guys get that. They went into a lot more depth than I'll be able to right now.\nQ: Is he going to stay in Washington this weekend, or is he going to go to Bedminster? Do we know yet?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll keep you posted.\nThanks.\nEND 7:50 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128153", "text": "THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. It's so nice. And we appreciate it. And all of the people outside that were waving proudly the American flag -- believe me, we appreciate it very much.\nI want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney -- (applause) -- and all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today. Where is Jerry? Where is Jerry? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Jerry. What a job. I've heard so much about you. It's a great honor to know you, Jerry. Thank you.\nI also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. (Applause.) Thank you, Steve. Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross. (Applause.) Small Business Administrator -- which, by the way, is a very large business, I will tell you that -- Linda McMahon, a friend of mine. (Applause.) And from the purely political world, a really great friend who did such an incredible job with his beautiful wife at the inauguration, Senator Roy Blunt. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Where's Roy? Thank you, Roy.\nGovernor Greitens is here, who is doing some job. (Applause.) Thank you, Governor. Special. Lieutenant Governor Parson. Lieutenant Governor, thank you, Lieutenant Governor. And our great members of Commerce [Congress], I want to thank you all for coming. There are so many. I was asking the Governor and Roy, I said, do you think I should announce them all? I have so many. But I'm honored that they're here.\nRepresentative Sam Graves. (Applause.) Representative Vicky Hartzler, who has been terrific. (Applause.) My friend for a long time, and just somebody that he liked me from the beginning and I liked him, Billy Long. Where's Billy? (Applause.) Billy. Right, Billy? Right from the beginning. Blaine Luetkemeyer -- where's Blaine? Good. Thank you, Blaine. (Applause.) Representative Jason Smith. (Applause.) Jason, thank you for everything, Jason. Representative Ann Wagner. Hi, Ann. Good job, Ann. (Applause.)\nAnd, I don't know, we have so many more. Anybody I forgot? Right? Everything okay? Good, I got it. You, I remember more than anybody. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. And to the congressmen and congresswomen, we very much appreciate you all being here. Thank you very much. (Applause.)\nBefore we begin, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. As we all know, our Gulf Coast was hit over the weekend with a devastating hurricane of historic proportion. Torrential rains and terrible flooding continue to pose a grave danger to life and to property. Our first responders have been doing absolutely heroic work to shepherd people out of harm's way, and their courage and devotion has saved countless lives. They represent truly the very best of America. (Applause.)\nWe must be vigilant. We must protect the lives of our people. I was on the ground in Texas yesterday to meet with Governor Abbott -- who is doing, by the way, and incredible job -- and local officials so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.\nIn difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. We see friend helping friend, neighbor helping neighbor, and stranger helping stranger. And together, we will endure and we will overcome. (Applause.)\nTo those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are here with you every single step of the way. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room -- every step of the way. (Applause.)\nTo those Americans who have lost loved ones: All of America is grieving with you, and our hearts are joined with yours forever. The citizens of Texas and the Gulf Coast need all the prayers, support, and resources our communities have to offer. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the resilience of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.\nTo the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you every single day after to restore, recover, and rebuild.\nAs our thoughts and prayers remain firmly with the citizens and our fellow people -- people -- great, great people -- all affected by this tragedy. We're also glad to be back in the heartland with the very, very fine folks of Missouri. (Applause.)\nAnd I said to Senator Blunt and I said to Billy Long on the plane coming in -- can I say \"Missouri,\" or should I say \"Missouruh\"? Okay? And they said, whatever you want is okay. So I said, good. But I'm especially pleased to be here in Springfield, the birthplace of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. Who would have known that? (Applause.)\nThis is the place where the \"Main Street of America\" got its start, and this is where America's main street will begin its big, beautiful comeback that -- you are seeing it right now. This is a comeback of historic proportions. You're seeing it happen right now. (Applause.) Right? You're seeing it.\nWe're here today to launch our plans to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies and on our workers. (Applause.) Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. And you have seen what's happening with regulations -- they're going fast. We need regulations, but many of them are unnecessary, and they're going fast. (Applause.)\nThat is why the foundation of our job creation agenda is to fundamentally reform our tax code for the first time in more than 30 years. I want to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker -- and pro-American. (Applause.)\nThere is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. (Applause.)\nAnd, by the way, before I start, Ivanka Trump -- I see my beautiful daughter is in the audience. Stand up, honey. (Applause.) She's working very hard. I'm very proud of Ivanka.\nFor many decades, Route 66 captured the American spirit. The communities along this historic route were a vivid symbol of America's booming industry. Truck drivers hauled made-in-America goods along this vital artery of commerce. Families passed through bustling towns on their way to explore the great American West. And high-quality manufacturing jobs lifted up communities, gave Americans a paycheck that could support a family. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that do it. (Applause.) Stand up. Stand up Mr. Cook. Stand up. (Applause.) I think they like you. And provided millions of our fellow citizens with the pride and dignity that comes with work.\nBut, in recent years, millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. And it wasn't pleasant to watch, especially for me. I would sit back -- I was in business -- and I could see what was happening. It wasn't good.\nIf we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore opportunity, then we must reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers. (Applause.)\nIn the last 10 years, our economy has grown at only around two percent a year. If you look at other countries and you look at what their GDP is, they're unhappy when it's seven, eight, nine. And I speak to them -- leaders of the countries -- how are you doing? \"Not well, not well.\" Why? \"GDP is down to seven percent.\" And I'm saying, we were hitting one percent just a number of months ago. So we're going to change that around, folks, that I can tell you. And we're going change it around fast. (Applause.)\nAnd today -- a very appropriate day that this should happen -- we just announced that we hit three percent in GDP. It just came out. (Applause.) And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit three percent. So we're really on our way.\nIf we achieve sustained three percent growth, that means 12 million new jobs and $10 trillion dollars of new economic activity over the next decade. That's some numbers. (Applause.) And I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent. There's no reason why we shouldn't. (Applause.)\nSo this is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hardworking Americans, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. And I don't want to be disappointed by Congress, do you understand me? Do you understand? (Applause.)\nCongress -- I think Congress is going to make a comeback. I hope so. (Laughter.) I tell you what, the United States is counting on it. (Applause.)\nHere are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. (Applause.) That means getting rid of the loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests.\nOur last major tax rewrite was 31 years ago. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest tax breaks, reduced the number of tax brackets from fifteen to two, and lowered tax rates for both individuals and businesses. At the time, it was really something special.\nSince then, our tax laws have tripled in size, and the tax code itself now spans more than 2,600 pages, and most of it is not understandable. Tax rates have increased, and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system. The tax code is now a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of Americans.\nIn 1935, the basic 1040 form that most people file had two simple pages of instructions. Today, that basic form has one hundred pages of instructions, and it's pretty complex stuff. The tax code is so complicated that more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes.\nThis enormous complexity is very unfair. It disadvantages ordinary Americans who don't have an army of accountants while benefitting deep-pocketed special interests. And most importantly, this is wrong. (Applause.) Thank you.\nFirst and foremost, our tax system should benefit loyal, hardworking Americans and their families. (Applause.) That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes -- and I'm speaking against myself when I do this, I have to tell you. And I might be speaking against Mr. Cook, and we're both okay with it, is that right? It's crazy. We're speaking -- maybe we shouldn't be doing this, you know? (Laughter.) But we're doing the right thing. (Applause.) True. And allow the vast majority of our citizens to file their taxes on a single, simple page without having to hire an accountant.\nSecond, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. It's time to give American workers the pay raise that they've been looking for for many, many years. (Applause.)\nIn 1986, Ronald Reagan led the world by cutting our corporate tax rate to 34 percent. That was below the average rate for developed countries at the time. Everybody thought that was a monumental thing that happened. But then, under this pro-America system, our economy boomed. It just went beautifully -- right through the roof. The middle class thrived and median family income increased.\nOther countries saw the success. They looked at us. They saw -- what is America doing? What's happening with the United States? And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.\nOver the past 30 years, the average business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, China and some others that are highly competitive, and really doing very well against us. They are taking us, frankly, to the cleaners. So we must -- we have no choice -- we must lower our taxes.\nAnd your Senator, Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you. And if she doesn't do it for you, you have to have to vote her out of office. (Applause.) She's got to make that commitment. She's got to make that commitment. If she doesn't do it, you just can't do this anymore, with the obstruction and the obstructionists. If we don't get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever -- we are looking for the biggest ever -- jobs and our country cannot take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. But, at a minimum, they won't take off the way they should.\nThe Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. Not one vote. We got not one vote to try and fix healthcare and get rid of Obamacare.\nThe strategy of our economic rivals has worked. They made their taxes lower -- and far lower, in many cases, than ours -- and jobs left our country. Large corporations changed their business models by exporting jobs to other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, where they'd make massive profits, and they wouldn't be paying tax to us either. So we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories. We got nothing but unemployment. We got nothing.\nOther businesses -- even classic American brands -- switched their headquarters to foreign countries. Because of this and other reasons, like weak borders, America remains stuck in the past. Although I have to tell you, we have General Kelly here today, and we stopped 78 percent -- going up to 80 percent -- on the border traffic coming through, in just a short period of time. (Applause.) He has done some job. A whole different world out there right now.\nToday, we are still taxing our businesses at 35 percent, and it's way more than that. And think of it: In some cases, way above 40 percent when you include state and local taxes, in various states. The United States is now behind France, behind Germany, behind Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and many other nations. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive trade deficits -- numbers that you would not believe.\nBut this administration is going to fix that. One by one, we're fixing it. We're working right now on NAFTA -- the horrible, terrible NAFTA deal that took so much business out of your state and out of your cities and towns, and we're working on it. Let's see what happens. (Applause.)\nMexico is not happy. (Laughter.) But as I told them, you made a lot of money for a lot of years and everybody left you alone. We got to change this deal. And hopefully we can renegotiate it. But if we can't, we'll terminate it and we'll start all over again with a real deal. (Applause.)\nSo when it comes to the business tax, we are dead last. Can you believe that? So this cannot be allowed to continue any longer. America must lead the way, not follow from behind.\nWe have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors, to one that is more than 60 percent higher. We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries. We have totally surrendered. We're not surrendering anymore. (Applause.)\nIdeally -- and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury -- we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15 percent, which would make our tax rate lower than most countries, but still, by no means the lowest, unfortunately, in the world. But it would make us highly competitive.\nIn other words, foreign companies have more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. They can pay their workers more, sell their products and services at lower cost, and still make more money than their U.S. competitors.\nWe cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, create jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America -- the America we love. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much.\nBecause when businesses compete for labor, your wages will go up. Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers, and it means more products made right here in the USA. (Applause.)\nWhen I was growing up, I always used to see the signs, and it was always stamped on the product: Made in the USA. You don't see it anymore. We're going to go back to Made in the USA -- Made in the USA.\" (Applause.)\nThe third principle for tax reform is a crucial one: tax relief for middle-class families. (Applause.) In a way -- and I've been saying this for a long time -- they've been sort of the forgotten people, but they're not forgotten any longer. I can tell you that. (Applause.)\nWe will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, and they can do lots of things with those paychecks. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but that means they'll go out, and they'll spend their money. And it will be a beautiful thing to watch. This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of raising a family. That's so important to Ivanka Trump. (Applause.) Very, very important to everybody in this room, but so important to my daughter. It's one of her real big beliefs. And she's very committed to that. Right, Ivanka?\nWe believe that ordinary Americans know better than Washington how to spend their own money, and we want to help them take home as much of their money as possible and then spend it. (Applause.) So they'll keep their money. They'll spend their money. They'll buy our product. Our factories will be moving again. Companies are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to prosper, and our country is going to be just like it says on that beautiful red hat -- it says: Make America Great Again. That's what we're going to do. (Applause.) Right?\nFourth and finally, we want to bring back trillions of dollars in wealth that's parked overseas. Because of our high tax rate and horrible, outdated, bureaucratic rules, large companies that do business overseas will often park their profits offshore to avoid paying a high United States tax if the money is brought back home. So they leave the money over there.\nThe amount of money we're talking about is anywhere from $3 trillion to $5 trillion. Can you believe that? By making it less punitive for companies to bring back this money, and by making the process far less bureaucratic and difficult, we can return trillions and trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.\nIt's time to invest in our country, to rebuild our communities, and to hire our great American workers. (Applause.)\nMy administration is embracing a new economic model. It's called very simply: The American Model. Under this system, we will encourage companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities. That is how we will all succeed and grow together, as one team, with one shared sense of purpose, and one glorious American destiny. (Applause.)\nSo today I'm calling on all members of Congress -- Democrat, Republican and independent -- to support pro-American tax reform. They have to do it. It's time. (Applause.) They have to do it. It is time.\nI'm calling on Congress to provide a level playing field for our workers and our companies, to attract new companies and businesses to our shores, and to put more money into the pockets of everyday, hardworking people and also into the pockets of our companies so they can continue to grow and expand. (Applause.)\nWhat could possibly be more bipartisan than allowing families to keep more of what they earn and creating an environment for real job and wage growth in the country that we love so much? (Applause.)\nSo let's put -- or at least try to put -- the partisan posturing behind us and come together as Americans to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve. (Applause.)\nIf we do this, if we unite in the name of common sense and the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars, and we will give America the competitive advantage that it so desperately needs and has been looking for for so long. It's time. (Applause.)\nProducts made with American hands, American labor, and American grit will once again be delivered throughout the world. It's true. (Applause.) It's time. Instead of exporting our jobs, we will export our goods. (Applause.) Our jobs will both stay here in America and come back to America. We'll have it both ways. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work. They will love getting up in the morning. They will love going to their job. They will love earning a big, fat, beautiful paycheck. They will be proud again. (Applause.)\nThat is the future I want for our people. That is the future I want for America -- a nation where we are proud, prosperous, united, and free.\nToday, I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things -- beautiful things -- for our country. I am asking every member of Congress, of which we have many with us today, to join me in unleashing America's full potential. I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our people.\nAnd if we do these things, and if we care for and support each other, and love each other, then we will truly make America great again.\nThank you. God bless you. (Applause.) God bless you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Governor, thank you. Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Senator. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2017-08-30", "title": "Remarks on Tax Reform in Springfield, Missouri"}

(Applause.)\nDr. Wright, Governor Justice, Senator Manchin, Senator Capito, Congressman Jenkins, Congressman McKinley, Congressman Mooney, Chairman Graney, Chairman Jordan, distinguished guests, it is my great honor to be here this evening with the leading voice of business in the Mountain State, the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce. (Applause.)\nAnd I bring greetings from a friend of mine and a friend of West Virginia, a businessman who's fighting every day for a boundless American future, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)\nBefore I get started, allow me to take a moment to address what I know is on everyone's heart tonight, the unprecedented natural disaster of Hurricane Harvey and the ongoing response of federal, state, and local officials, and countless volunteers who are involved in rescue and recovery efforts even as we speak.\nThe American people and the world have been transfixed with images of destruction and suffering and the resilience of the people of Texas and Louisiana as Hurricane Harvey has battered that state -- now Louisiana -- over the past five days.\nAs the President said in Missouri earlier today, \"this storm continues to pose a danger to life and property,\" and we urge everyone, all across that region to put safety first and continue to listen to local officials and emergency managers before venturing out into this still-dangerous storm.\nThe President, my family, and our entire administration have been deeply moved by the suffering of so many. And even before the storm made landfall, President Trump took decisive action to bring the full resources of the federal government to support state and local first responders.\nThe President convened the Cabinet twice over the weekend to ensure our administration is effectively partnering with state and local officials.\nAt this very moment, there are more than 10,800 federal employees working hand-in-hand with state and local law enforcement to help the people of Texas and Louisiana.\nThe Coast Guard and the Navy are conducting search-and-rescue operations even as we speak. And with more than 60 Department of Defense aircraft, along with aircraft of Texas National Guard, they are rescuing Americans in harm's way.\nUrban search-and-rescue taskforces are being coordinated by FEMA, and we've shipped more than 2.9 million meals, more than 2.8 million liters of water, and there's more help on the way.\nPresident Trump and I commend Governor Greg Abbott for his incredible leadership, and the efforts of all state and local officials in Texas and Louisiana. (Applause.)\nThe state emergency management, the Texas National Guard, and first responders have been amazing. And as the President said, their courage and devotion has saved countless lives, and it represents the best of America. (Applause.)\nAs all of you know, President Trump and the First Lady traveled to Texas just yesterday to oversee our rescue and recovery efforts, to stand with the people of Texas, and to assure them that our administration will continue to provide them all with the support that they need.\nThe President actually asked me and my wife to travel to Texas tomorrow with the same heartfelt message. To Texas and Louisiana we say: We are with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you every single day to restore, recover, and rebuild. (Applause.)\nEven in this challenging time, the people of Texas are proving yet again that the brightest lights oftentimes come the darkest moments. In the midst of this historic storm, the people of Texas have responded with their very best. This could well be Texas's finest hour.\nThe road to recovery will be long and difficult. But as the President said, we will endure, we will overcome.\nBut we all need to do our part to help our fellow Americans get back on their feet.\nWhen Congress reconvenes next week, the President will be calling on our nation's lawmakers, including all of those gathered here, to take immediate action to pass additional funding for federal disaster assistance for families and businesses affected by this storm. (Applause.)\nThe President and I ask for your support and the support of the members of the House and Senate who are here as we move this legislation forward.\nSecond, we encourage each of you and all of your businesses to look for ways to support the efforts of organizations like Red Cross, Salvation Army, Samaritan's Purse, and so other private organizations that, as we stand here, are providing food and water and blankets and other basic provisions now and in the weeks and months ahead.\nThe needs are great, but we know the generosity of the American people will be greater still. (Applause.)\nAnd lastly, the President and I would ask all of you gathered here to take a moment in the days ahead to pray -- pray for the families who have suffered loss and the loss of a loved one; pray for the first responders, who at this very hour are working to save lives; pray for the federal, state, and local officials who are on the ground; and pray for countless volunteers, who we've all seen come alongside neighbors and even strangers in this hour of need.\nWith the leadership of our President, and the dedication of all the state and local officials, with the courage of our first responders, and with faith in Him who calms the storm, I say with confidence, the good and strong people of Texas and Louisiana will come through this terrible tragedy. And as the President said, the Gulf Coast and America itself will be \"bigger, better, and stronger than ever before.\" (Applause.)\nSo thank you.\nIt'll be a long way back for those who've suffered much. It will require our ongoing commitment of public resources -- those that I described -- and the generosity of businesses and the American people. But beyond that, the President and I know that the best way to ensure the long-term recovery of America's fourth-largest city, and the Gulf Coast region, and our entire country is robust economic growth, which is what brings me here tonight.\nTo spur that growth, earlier today in Missouri, President Trump proposed what he called an \"American model\" that will empower our country to in his words \"succeed and grow together -- as one team, with one shared sense of purpose, and one glorious sense of destiny.\"\nIt's great to be back in the Mountain State, addressing the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce. This is an organization that knows a lot about growth and a lot about jobs and opportunities.\nFor more than 80 years, this vital organization has brought together companies large and small to in your words \"make West Virginia a better place to do business\" and \"enhance the quality of life\" for your fellow citizens. And you all have been doing just that.\nToday, you represent more than 5,000 job creators in all 55 counties, accounting for more than half of West Virginia's workforce. So why don't you give yourselves a round of applause for the difference that the businesses and men and women here make in the lives of West Virginians every day? (Applause.)\nAnd I got to tell you from day one of this administration, our President has been focused right where all of you are focused every day -- on job creation and opportunities. And really, the results speak for themselves. President Trump has signed more laws to cut through federal red tape than any President in American history and has already saved businesses up to $18 billion a year in costs. (Applause.)\nIn fact, the President ordered every agency in Washington, D.C. to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any new federal red tape on job creators across America. (Applause.)\nTo fuel a great revival of American industry, President Trump has been unleashing American energy, which is something West Virginia knows an awful lot about.\nThe President already approved the Keystone and Dakota pipelines, he's rolled back the so-called Clean Power Plan, and under President Donald Trump, the war on coal is over! (Applause.)\nThe great news is weekly coal production in the Mountain State has jumped 19 percent over last year alone. And as the people of West Virginia heard the President say earlier this month, in his words, \"We are building our future with American labor and hands and aluminum and steel.\" And what else? Coal. (Applause.)\nPresident Trump's leadership is already making a remarkable difference. Optimism is sweeping all across this country. Businesses large and small as I stand here today have created more than 1 million new jobs since January 1 of this year. (Applause.)\nUnemployment hasn't been this low in 16 year, and more Americans are going to work than ever before in our nation's history. For the last eight years, the American economy averaged growth of only 1.8 percent. But in case you didn't hear about it, just this morning, the Department of Commerce announced that growth in the second quarter reached 3 percent for the first time in years. (Applause.)\nMen and women, I'm here to tell you President Trump is keeping his promise to make America prosperous again, and under this President's leadership, America is back. (Applause.)\nNow, if we can keep up the momentum, the results are truly going to be remarkable. Think about it, with just a 3 percent growth rate, we'll create more than 12 million new jobs, nearly $10 trillion in economic activity. And over the next decade, the average income for American families will rise by nearly $7,000 a year.\nAnd the President sent me here tonight, to make the case to the people of West Virginia on how we can achieve and sustain that kind of economic growth.\nThe President's strong conviction is -- and I know it's shared by many people in this room -- the time has come to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. (Applause.)\nToday, President Trump proposed what will, in fact, be the single biggest tax cut in American history. Speaking in Springfield, Missouri, President Trump called on the Congress in his words to \"fundamentally reform our tax code for the first time in more than 30 years\" by passing a historic tax cut that again, as he said, is \"pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, and pro-American.\" (Applause.)\nThe truth is that cutting taxes is the single-most important thing we can do to create jobs, raise wages, and restore prosperity for the American people. And as the President said today, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do just that.\nIt's a time-honored truth: When you cut taxes, you launch a new era of soaring incomes, more jobs, and a thriving middle class. John F. Kennedy proved it. Ronald Reagan proved it. And President Donald Trump will prove it once again. (Applause.)\nThe unbroken truth of economic history is that tax cuts spark growth, and the bigger the cut, the bigger the growth.\nRight now, our Internal Revenue Code unfortunately is stuck in the past. Under our taxation system we have taxes that burden American families and actually hinder economic growth.\nYou know, there's an old joke that the tax code is 10 times the length of the Bible with none of the good news. (Laughter.) And it's true. It's really no laughing matter.\nThe truth is the tax code is too complex. Our taxes are too high. And our tax system has been hurting the American people for too long. Today, taxpayers spend over 6 billion hours every year dealing writing their taxes. About 94 percent of Americans, and more than 90 percent of small businesses have to pay somebody to prepare their taxes for them because it's frankly impossible to do it on your own. Folks, you shouldn't have to hire a lawyer or accountant to figure out how much tax you owe the government. (Applause.)\nAll told, complying with the tax code costs our economy $262 billion every single year and nearly $1,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. Our tax code is literally robbing the wealth of our families and future generations.\nAnd while the tax code has been growing in size, tax rates have been rising, too -- especially on job creators, the heart of this economy. As you well know, American businesses now face a staggering tax rate of 39 percent, the third-highest in the industrialized world -- and roughly 60 percent higher, on average, than our biggest competitors around the planet. As the President said today, when it comes to our tax code, \"America remains stuck in the past.\"\nChina, Japan, Germany, Canada, Mexico -- every major developed country has a lower business tax rate than the United States of America. Well, that just shouldn't be.\nWe're one of the few countries in the world that actually taxes every dollar our companies earn overseas, putting our businesses at a tremendous disadvantage.\nPresident Calvin Coolidge actually wisely observed, \"the power to tax is the power to destroy,\" And today, our system of taxation is literally destroying the dreams of too many Americans.\nOur tax code makes it harder for companies to hire, to give raises, to invest in their employees' success.\nOur tax code actually kills jobs and stifles the entrepreneurship and the very work ethic that will move our country forward. Our tax code causes American companies to close factories and build them elsewhere around the world.\nAnd our tax code has given foreign companies an enormous competitive edge over U.S. job creators. And dozens of businesses, including many iconic names, have literally fled the United States in favor of other countries where the burden of taxation isn't so heavy.\nIn short, America's tax code destroys our wealth, it destroys our jobs, and it destroys the enterprising spirit of the American people. And that is ultimately the true source of our prosperity.\nBottom line: It's time for a change. And under the President Donald Trump's leadership, we're going to bring that change. (Applause.) We're going to put more money in the American people's pockets. We're going to put our job creators back on the road to success when President Donald Trump signs historic tax relief that will once again put America First.\nOur tax-cut plan will bring back our jobs, bring back our wealth, and bring back our dreams. It's based on four principles that every American should be able to get behind.\nFirst, as the President announced today, we need a tax code \"that's simple, fair, and easy to understand.\"\nSecond, we need a tax code that makes America competitive again and creates more jobs and gives working families the raise they deserve.\nThird, we need to cut taxes across the board for middle-class families.\nAnd finally, we need to cut taxes so businesses can bring back the trillions of dollars that are trapped overseas to avoid unfair taxes and bring them here to create jobs in America. (Applause.)\nThat's our President's vision, and here's how we're going to bring this vision to life. The American people always know how to spend their money better than some bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., so we're going to start out by cutting marginal rates to keep working families -- give them the opportunity to keep more of their hard-earned dollars.\nWe're going to simplify the tax code so that working Americans can file their taxes by themselves on a single sheet of paper. (Applause.)\nWe're going to cut out the hand-outs, the carve-outs, the loopholes that benefit the wealthy and the well-connected, and make the tax code flatter and fairer for everyone.\nAnd when it comes to businesses, President Trump is going to be fighting to cut the corporate tax rate in America so American companies can compete against anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world. (Applause.)\nAnd we'll also make sure that small businesses get the same benefits and tax relief that major corporations experience. (Applause.)\nAnd we're going to cut taxes so that the more than $2.6 trillion locked overseas can come home -- to spur an avalanche of investment that will benefit every American for years to come.\nIn short, President Trump will empower American companies and workers to compete on a level playing field with anyone, anywhere in the world. And as we know, when the field is level, American workers always win. (Applause.)\nMy friends, we all know what tax cuts will mean for American workers. Tax cuts mean more jobs. Tax cuts mean a raise in income for American workers. Tax cuts will mean an economy where anything is possible, and where anyone can achieve the American Dream.\nMy friends, President Trump's tax-cut plan will usher in an unprecedented era of growth and prosperity for all of the American people. It's a big task, and it'll take all of us to get the job done. And we're counting on West Virginia's support.\nWe need all of the businesses represented here to speak out, to talk to your employees, tell your lawmakers how much you need these tax cuts. Your voice is vitally important, and you need to be more outspoken than ever before.\nIt's time to do what's right, to put the American people first. And today, President Trump in addition to calling on all of you, made a point in his words to call \"on all members of Congress -- Democrat, Republican, or independent -- to \"put the partisan posturing behind us, and come together as Americans to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve.\" (Applause.)\nPresident Trump and I need the support of West Virginia's leaders in the Congress. So to both your senators and all of your congressmen, I say America needs this. West Virginia needs this.\nAnd let me say to Shelley and especially to Joe, the President and the people of the Mountain State are counting on you to deliver tax relief. (Applause.)\nLet's decide tonight that we're going to get tax cuts done for West Virginia and for every American, and we're going to get it done together.\nAnd with the help of all these West Virginia businesses, and the support of all your members of Congress gathered here, and with the leadership of President Donald Trump, I know we will pass historic tax cuts this year, and we will deliver real economic growth that will be lasting for the American people. (Applause.)\nThe truth is that tax cuts are the linchpin to making the strongest economy in the world even stronger still. But as I close, let me also say that a growing economy is absolutely essential at such a time as this. Tonight, wherever you call home, the hearts of every American are in Texas. I know that. Soon, the rains will subside, the floods will recede, the sun will once again break through the clouds above.\nAnd when that day comes, the people of Texas and Louisiana, who've suffered so much, will do as Americans have always done -- they'll rebuild their lives, their homes, their communities, and their great cities.\nThe American people will be with them in this task, working shoulder-to-shoulder, hand-in-hand. But the surest path to the greatest recovery and the strongest renewal for Texas, for Louisiana, for all of America is a growing economy.\nThat's why President Trump is going to keep fighting every day to unleash a new era of growth and jobs and opportunity and prosperity, so we can meet our obligations and our aspirations; and so that when we, as a nation, look back at this storm and at these turbulent times, we will remember not what was swept away, but we will remember what we built in its wake together. (Applause.)\nWe have much work to do -- to rebuild those towns and cities of Texas and Louisiana, to renew our communities all across this country, to restore our belief that America's best days are within our grasp.\nAnd as we work, and as we labor, I believe we would do well to remember that timeless wisdom, wisdom to which Americans have repaired all throughout our history. As we rebuild in the wake of this great storm, as we bring our nation together in these too-divided times, let us remember that, \"Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.\" (Applause.)\nSo let's work. And let's pray and let's have faith. Thank you for the opportunity to address you tonight. As I close my remarks, I do so with confidence and with faith that with your help and support, with the strength and resilience of the people all across this country, and with the leadership of President Donald Trump, and with God's help, we will make America prosperous again. We will make America proud again. And to borrow a phrase, we will Make America Great Again. (Applause.)\nThank you very much. God bless West Virginia and God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2017-08-30", "title": "Remarks by the Vice President to the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce Summit in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia"}

SANDERS: Just a quick update -- and I'll try to get you guys copies unless you get them in your inboxes -- about the time we land and I don't have time to turn around fast enough.\nBut the President, while we were in flight, spoke with King Salman from Saudi Arabia, and we put out a readout. But you guys wouldn't have gotten that here in the last little bit.\nHe's continued to do meetings and calls throughout the flight. We'll keep you guys posted on any details on that, but we'll jump right into questions beyond that.\nQ: The President tweeted this morning about extortion money to North Korea and said talks are not enough. What did he mean by that? Is he suggesting some kind of strike?\nMS. SANDERS: The State Department has put out a statement on that, and I would refer to you to that; I think it explains that pretty well.\nQ: But Sarah, is he saying that diplomacy is being abandoned?\nMS. SANDERS: No. I mean, as we've said before, we're going to use all methods and that will continue to be one of them, but only a part of the integrated policy and plan moving forward.\nQ: Haley said yesterday that \"something serious needs to happen\" with North Korea. Does the President agree with that?\nMS. SANDERS: I think the President has been very clear about his position on North Korea, certainly in his statement by saying all options are on the table, and that continues to be the case.\nQ: But \"something serious needs to happen\" is a little different from \"all options are on the table.\" Does something serious need to happen in North Korea?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, again, I think we've been taking serious action by putting strong sanctions, continuing to put pressure across the board, and weighing our options. And when we make a -- you know, the President makes a decision about next steps, we'll certainly keep you guys in the loop on that front.\nQ: Sarah, we didn't really have a chance to ask you about it when he said it, but Steve Bannon, last week or maybe the week before, said that there was no military solution in North Korea -- kind of pointed out what would be a catastrophic loss of life if one was undertaken. Is that an opinion that the President shares?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I think the President has been pretty clear that he feels that there could be. And certainly, I think that if he was looking at that direction, he would be leaning heavily on people like General Mattis, the Department of Defense, and others.\nQ: Can I ask you about Harvey funding? There's some movement in Congress to maybe pass the CR and wrap up some Harvey funding in that, and then not include funding for the border wall. Is that something the President would support?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, as I said to several of the folks traveling yesterday, we're looking at the best way to help the people of Texas, and we're going to continue pushing forward to make sure they get funding, and we'll see what that looks like as we move forward in the process and determine the next best steps.\nQ: Does he still feel like a shutdown might be appropriate given the events in Texas and Louisiana?\nMS. SANDERS: As he said earlier this week, he doesn't see those things tied to one another.\nQ: What did he mean by he had seen the horror and devastation firsthand?\nMS. SANDERS: He met with a number of state and local officials who are eating, sleeping, breathing the Harvey disaster. He talked extensively with the governor, who certainly is right in the midst of every bit of this, as well as the mayors from several of the local towns that were hit hardest. And detailed briefing information throughout the day yesterday talking to a lot of the people on the ground -- that certainly is a firsthand account.\nQ: You said yesterday you would check if the President or the First Lady had made a personal donation to hurricane relief. Have you gotten anything back on that?\nMS. SANDERS: No, I know they're looking into some different options.\nQ: There was a report that the President turned down a couple offers from China to reduce its steel capacity by 150 million tons. Is that accurate?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of that, so I certainly can't comment right now.\nQ: Sarah, why did the President not mention Gary Cohn today from the stage?\nMS. SANDERS: It's pretty standard practice for us not to specifically call out staff. He regularly mentions Cabinet members but very rarely mentions staff in speeches.\nQ: But he mentioned his daughter and he mentioned Kelly.\nMS. SANDERS: His daughter, I think, in this case, would be a little bit different. But again, it's pretty standard practice for him to mention specific Cabinet members.\nBut I mean, you know, a lot of times when he talks about foreign policy and different things like that, he doesn't necessarily call out National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster even though he plays a very integral role in that process.\nQ: What's different about Ivanka? You say she's a little bit different in this case.\nMS. SANDERS: Well, I mean, he was also recognizing her as his daughter. So I think that's a little hard to separate in that sense.\nQ: So we shouldn't read anything into that about their relationship? How are they getting along? The rumors about Gary --\nMS. SANDERS: Well, look, Gary is here. The President is here. They're both working hard and extremely committed to providing tax relief for middle-class America. The President has made very clear this is a top priority for him, for his administration, and Gary is one of the people leading the charge in that effort for him and will continue to do that.\nQ: On DACA, I know that you guys said that you were reviewing it, but also the President has talked about how this is a tough one for him -- between the kids and between the law, and is it -- the legality, is it constitutional. Does the review of the program also include talking to his advisors, talking to stakeholders on what they think about the program?\nMS. SANDERS: They've taken a lot of accounts, certainly, into this process. This has been a very lengthy review and it's certainly not over. It's something that is still being discussed and a final decision hasn't been made.\nQ: Does the President still think that tax reform can get done by the end of the year?\nMS. SANDERS: I think he certainly, for the American people, hopes so. This is, again, like I just said, a top priority for the administration. But not just for the administration but for all of America. The ability to give pay raises and pay increases to people across the country, particularly the middle class -- to really help those people out is something that the President campaigned on, talked about, and is extremely committed to. And it's something we certainly hope to see by the end of the year.\nAnd, hopefully Congress will get on board. Frankly, I think it's really sad if they don't. If they are not here to help the American people, then maybe they should look into doing something else.\nQ: Well, on that point, a big part of the speech today was about unity. How does it inspire bipartisanship when he takes aim -- levels a political threat at the home-state senator?\nMS. SANDERS: Look, I would hardly call a political threat not asking all members of Congress to step up and do their job. It's not a political threat when you ask a member of Congress to do their job. And if you don't, you shouldn't get to keep it.\nI mean, I think if you didn't do your job at the Wall Street Journal, they'd certainly fire you and they should. If I didn't do my job, I should expect to get fired. If Congress doesn't do their job, they shouldn't get to keep it.\nQ: Sarah, can you explain when the President said that under President Obama, there had never been quarterly 3 percent GDP growth? That's happened multiple times under President Obama. What was he referring to?\nMS. SANDERS: Do you know where that was? I'm sorry, I just didn't see that today. Was that --\nQ: That was in his speech today.\nMS. SANDERS: I'll have to look into that. I must have missed that specific --\nQ: Both in the background call yesterday and the speech today, the President is going to be talking a lot about the corporate tax rate. Is he still committed to lowering the individual tax rates?\nMS. SANDERS: He certainly still wants to help create jobs and that's one way to do that. And we're looking for, as he said many times before, both during the campaign and as President, every opportunity we can find to create jobs and increase wages we're going to do that.\nQ: What was the magazine cover that the President tweeted about this morning?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll have to ask. I'm not sure, Justin. I'll take one more so I don't fall on Bender when we land.\nQ: Is it Congress's job to follow the President's orders and support whatever he says, as far as tax plans go?\nMS. SANDERS: It's Congress's job to do what the American people are asking them to do, and I don't think you'll find an American, probably, anywhere in this country that doesn't want tax reform, that doesn't want a more simplified process, that doesn't want more money in their pockets.\nLook, the American people know that they can spend their money a whole lot better than the government can. They'd like to keep more of it. If you can find somebody that doesn't want that, you let me know, because I'd be really surprised.\nSo it's not just that the President, although he is laying out an extremely bold and optimistic vision for the country -- Americans have demanded this. This is what they want. This is one of the reasons they elected Donald Trump, and frankly it's one of the reasons they probably elected a lot of the members of Congress. If you go back and look at most of their past statements, they probably campaigned on reforming the tax code, making things better for the American people, and this is one of the biggest ways that they can do that.\nQ: One last one -- I'll catch you if you fall here -- does the President have confidence in Secretary Tillerson?\nMS. SANDERS: Absolutely. I answered this question yesterday. Thanks, guys.\nEND 5:29 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2017-08-30", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders"}

We also take this time to extend our sincerest gratitude to first responders, who selflessly run toward danger to keep our Nation and its people safe. We vow to support them and provide the tools they need to save lives.\nThis year marks the 5-year anniversary of Hurricane Sandy, which ravaged the Northeast; the 10-year anniversary of the Enhanced Fujita (EF) level-5 tornado that leveled 95 percent of the Greensburg, Kansas, community; and the 25-year anniversary of Hurricane Andrew, the most destructive hurricane in Florida's history. And, this week we are especially mindful of those affected by the catastrophic Hurricane Harvey, which brought historic floods to Texas. While these tragedies underscore our vulnerabilities, they also remind us of our Nation's great resilience. In the responses to each of these unexpected disasters, we have seen the character of the American spirit -- courageousness, determination, and generosity.\nThis month we recognize that by educating the Nation on how to prepare and respond to emergencies, we can save countless lives. Unfortunately, fewer than half of American families report having an emergency response plan. While we never know when the next disaster will strike, it is incumbent upon every American to be prepared.\nAmericans can start today to improve our readiness for the next disaster. The first steps include making and practicing a family emergency response plan, creating an emergency supply kit, and signing up for emergency alerts. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's Ready campaign outlines additional important and low-cost measures Americans can take right now to protect their family, pets, and property before a major disaster. Together, we will create a stronger and safer Nation.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2017 as National Preparedness Month. I encourage all Americans, including Federal, State, and local officials, to take action to be prepared for disaster or emergency by making and practicing their plans. Each step we take to become better prepared will make a real difference in how our families and communities will respond and persevere when faced with the unexpected.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\nDONALD J.

Trump\nAN AMERICA FIRST TAX SYSTEM: President Donald J. Trump is working to reform our tax system so that Americans are treated fairly and can keep more of their hard-earned money, and companies can bring jobs back to the United States.\n* President Trump will jumpstart America's economic engine by making it the most desirable country in the world for businesses to invest and grow.\n* By lowering taxes, President Trump is helping boost take-home pay for all American workers.\n* President Trump will restore fairness to our tax system by simplifying the tax code and closing special interest loopholes.\n* Making our tax code competitive puts the American economy and the American worker first.\nA BURDEN ON AMERICAN TAXPAYERS: The current tax code has grown out of control in length and complexity so that many Americans must rely on professional help to file even the simplest return.\n* The tax code has increased so much in length and complexity that hundreds of pages in instructions are necessary to file even the most basic tax returns.\n* The typical Form 1040, used by most American families, has grown to 79 lines from only 34 lines in 1935, according to the National Taxpayers Union.\n* The instructions alone for the form has grown to 241 pages from just 2 pages in 1935.\n* The tax code is over six times as long as it was in 1955, according to the Tax Foundation.\n* A complex and ever changing tax code is unworkable for most Americans, forcing them to spend too much of their time and income on paid professionals and filing aids just to pay their taxes.\n* Taxpayers spend over 6 billion hours annually complying with the tax code, according to the IRS's Taxpayer Advocate Service.\n* Just to comply with the tax code puts a $262 billion burden on the economy, according to the National Taxpayers Union.\n* Over half of all tax returns filed in 2017 were prepared by a tax professional, according to the IRS.\n* 94 percent of taxpayers paid someone or used software to prepare their returns, according to the National Taxpayers Union.\n* 91 percent of small businesses hired a professional to do their taxes, according to the National Federation of Independent Business.\n* The Form 1040 tax return used by most Americans costs $176 to complete with the average accounting firm, according to the National Society of Accountants.\n* Small businesses incur between $15 and $16 billion on tax compliance costs, according to the National Federation of Independent Business.\n* It is no wonder that, according to IBISWorld, the tax preparation industry earned $10 billion in revenue in 2016.\nHARMING AMERICAN JOB-CREATORS: Our outdated tax code makes our businesses uncompetitive as other nations provide lower tax rates, and incentivizes American businesses to move their headquarters or offshore jobs.\n* The United States now has the highest corporate tax rate among the 35 advanced economies in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD).\n* The combined corporate tax rate in the United States is now 39 percent, according to OECD data, compared to an average of 24 percent among OECD member countries.\n* China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Australia all have lower corporate tax rates than the United States.\n* As rates fell across the developed world from the early 1990's to 2016, the United States' corporate tax rate increased.\n* The United States' corporate tax rate is 16.4 percentage points higher than the worldwide average, according to the Tax Foundation.\n* Businesses are moving their facilities and jobs out of the country to escape our burdensome tax code.\n* The money American businesses earn overseas is being kept out of the country to avoid our high corporate tax rate.\n* Since 2014, there has been an increase in inversions as American companies try to avoid the incredible disadvantages of our corporate tax system.\n* Fortune 500 corporations are holding more than $2.6 trillion in profits offshore to avoid $767 billion in Federal taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.", "timestamp": "2017-08-30", "title": "Press Release - President Donald J.

We had a remarkable and informative, but also a heartbreaking trip as we saw devastation from Rockport to Aransas County, all the way over to Victoria. We saw broken homes, and we talked to so many people with broken hearts.\nBut we also saw something that is so incredible that has arisen because of this crisis, and that is the resiliency of our fellow Texans and our fellow Americans.\nWe went up to some homes of people who had their homes completely destroyed. They were sitting out front, and they were just proud to be a Texan and proud that we were there to help them out. We went to help remove debris from a lawn that was completely littered. And I had a chance to hold a two-week-old baby, a baby that was born just days before Hurricane Harvey hit our coast. And his mom was a prideful mom, beaming with that big motherly smile that you would expect as if the storm had never hit. But I want you to know it has hit. It's hit the lives of the people all the way from Nueces County to Jefferson County, and horrific flooding in between.\nAnd I am so proud of the way that the President and the Vice President and their entire Cabinet have stood up, stood strong, and supported the people of Texas.\nSince more than a week before the hurricane even came ashore, the President and his Cabinet were in constant contact with my office asking, Governor, what can we do for the people of Texas? Ever since then, there's been close daily collaboration between my office with local officials, with the White House, and with their Cabinet.\nI've never seen a President, a Vice President, or a Cabinet who have responded as swiftly and as effectively to people in need like the people of Texas overcoming the tragedy of Hurricane Harvey.\nMr. Vice President, I thank you. I thank the President. I thank the Cabinet members with us here today.\nBut candidly, I got to tell you, the people I thank the most are our fellow Texans -- the way that we see Texans helping Texans, rescue each other, pull each other of flooding waters and save their lives, it's the average, everyday Texan who are the true heroes.\nBut we know, Mr. Vice President, that this is going to take more than a few days for us to overcome. It's going to take months as we go into the transition period, and then years for us to fully recover. And I could not be prouder to have as partners in this process President Trump, our tremendous Vice President, and the men and women who serve in the President's Cabinet.\nI'm honored to have with me here today a man who is more than the Vice President of the United States, a man who is a friend, a man who knows how to govern, a man who knows how to face challenges and overcome those challenges, a man who will help Texas lead to build an ever better Texas. I'm proud to introduce Mike Pence, the Vice President of the United States.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Governor Abbott. And, Cecilia, thank you for the extraordinary leadership that you're providing for the people of Texas.\nI think the President said just yesterday that you were doing an incredible job, and traveling as we did today here through Corpus Christi and Rockport and Victoria, seeing the response on the ground, seeing the results, I echo that with a grateful heart. Thank you for your leadership.\nI'm also grateful to be joined by members of our Cabinet -- Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Shulkin, and who else is back here? Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta, and we'll hear just momentarily from each one of them, as well as our Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke.\nThe President send Karen and I here today to survey the damage and ensure that the full resources of the federal government are being brought in support of the effort of state and local officials to rescue those that are in harm's way, to help communities begin to recover, and to lay a foundation to rebuild Texas in the wake of this horrific storm.\nThe President will be returning to Texas this Saturday with the First Lady and will be traveling to Houston and other destinations within the state, again, to reinforce our administration's commitment to bring the resources and the compassion of the American people to this dire moment in the life of Texas.\nThe President also sent me here with a very simple message: First, a message of gratitude to this governor and to state and local officials who have stepped forward with such professionalism and such consistency in this historic storm.\nSecondly, a word of gratitude to all of your first responders here in Texas, those who at this very hour are continuing to put themselves in harm's way to rescue people and deliver them from danger. They and you have inspired the nation, and we commend them on behalf of our President.\nI'm also here to express our appreciation and admiration for the federal team -- some 21,000 federal officials that are here on the ground in Texas -- Department of Defense personnel, FEMA personnel. Our President and our entire administration are proud of the long hours and the efforts that each of you have put into this effort to date and the commitment you have to see this through.\nAnd lastly as the Governor alluded, I think Karen and I today were most inspired by the volunteers. To see the outpouring of compassion and concern was deeply inspiring to us. And every American should know that even in this difficult time and this disastrous storm, the very best are the people of Texas, and the very best are the people of America shining forth.\nWe stood in a yard. We watched total strangers helping to remove debris, helping people put their families and their lives back together. And on behalf of the President, I want to urge every American to do what Texans, who themselves are oftentimes dealing with hardship in their own household and their own family are doing, and that is find a way to help.\nYou can go online. You can donate resources, or you can do it like thousands of Americans are already doing and will be doing in the weeks and months ahead, and that is find a way to get here and be the hands and feet and compassion of the American people to help these families, help these communities rebuild.\nPresident Trump often reminds that we are one American family, that when one hurts, we all hurt. We stand together in difficult times. And to the people of Texas, on behalf of President Trump, I say you were are in our prayers and in our hearts. And we are with you. As the President said in his visit here earlier this week and said again yesterday, I say today, on behalf of the American people, with the leadership of President Donald Trump to the people of Texas, we are with you today. We will be with you tomorrow, and we will be with you every day until this great state and these great communities recover and rebuild to be even better and stronger than ever before.\nWith that, allow me to recognize the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Elaine Duke.\nACTING SECRETARY DUKE: Good afternoon. As the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, my job is to tell you about the work that the federal government is doing in supporting the Governor and the state of Texas in its recovery.\nAs the Vice President said, we've rescued more than 10,000 people from the state of Texas, and we're in the process of individual assistance to help people get back to their lives and homes.\nTo date, we've approved already over 100,000 requests, totaling $50 million of individual assistance.\nToday, we saw some hope of the recovery. Some of the hope was in infrastructure. The Hobby Airport and George Bush Intercontinental Airport opening. But more important, we saw the hope in the people. This is a real partnership to complete the work that needs to be done in Texas. We, as the federal government will be supporting the state and its people. The not-for-profits that are here -- hugely important. Congress -- everyone it is important that we all come together.\nAnd I think what was most momentous to me, led by the survivors that we met with today, was how much hope, joy, and love is still in Texas. And I just pray that that flows throughout the world and grows in the United States and beyond.\nWe will continue with the infrastructure recovery. We expect search and rescue to continue for the next couple days, the waters to peak -- hopefully within two days. And then as they recede, we can get out of the search and rescue mode and more further into recovery for the survivors in the area.\nAnd again, I thank you, and it's an honor to be here and be able to support this and take the energy back to DHS, where we will continue to work with the people of Texas.\nThank you. I'd like to turn it over now to Secretary Chao.\nSECRETARY CHAO: Thank you. Today has been a very emotional and yet inspiring day as you have heard from the Governor, the Vice President, and also Secretary Duke.\nThe Department of Transportation is doing everything possible to support Governor Abbott and the people of Texas. We are making available more than $100 million in financial support to meet the infrastructure needs of Texas. There's approximately $350 million impending Department of Transportation funds available to Texas between today and the end of the fiscal year, October 1st-September 30th.\nThe Department has over 40 staff in the Modal Administration's ground, air, transit, railways, waterways on the ground coordinating, getting transit assets back up and running, finding drivers of buses and trucks, for example. And a team from the Federal Highways Administration has been on the ground before the storm even made landfall providing technical assistance to the Texas Department of Transportation.\nWe are working with the state of Texas to reopen the airports. So far, as you have heard, Corpus Christi, New Orleans, Houston IAH, Houston Hobby, and Victoria are open in some capacity. Beaumont Airport remains closed except for military flights.\nRoads in the impacted areas continue to be inundated with water, with many closures. We are learning more by the hour, and are working with our state partners to assess conditions as quickly as the water recedes.\nWe have also identified more than 200 engineers who can be on the scene within 48 hours to begin expedited inspections of roads and bridges so we can be on the way to recovery.\nOur crisis center is manned 24/7 to monitor critical infrastructure. We also have a special hotline for first responders and others who need to know how to get around blocked routes.\nAnd just an hour ago I've signed an executive order at the request of Governor Abbott, basically waiving the requirements to allow expedited fuel deliveries from 25 surrounding states to help the delivery fuel to Texas because one of the things that we are learning is the declining supplies of aviation, oil, gasoline, all sorts of fuel supplies. So, Governor, we have waived that requirement and you've got.\nGOVERNOR ABBOTT: Thank you. We need it. You're a blessing. (Applause.)\nSECRETARY CHAO: I was once Secretary of Labor, so I cannot forget the current Secretary of Labor Alexis Acosta. Alexi?\nSECRETARY ACOSTA: Thank you. Today was a difficult day. We saw a lot of destruction. But we also saw individuals, Texans that were here, as the Governor said, helping each other. Texans helping Texans. And my takeaway today is that Texans are survivors. They are helping each other. They are solving their problems.\nThe President also wants to make sure, however, that all of us in the Cabinet are here to support the Governor and to support his efforts. And so there are individuals that may be wondering what will happen to my job. Will it be there? Will I have to retrain?\nAnd so the Department of Labor is making available to the state of Texas $30 million to assess workforce needs from the Dislocated Worker Fund. We've also approved disaster unemployment insurance so that those individuals that do not qualify otherwise through unemployment insurance can have access to a means to make it by until they find a job.\nToday, we saw individuals that are going to survive and are going to rebound because they are resilient. They are determined to rebuild, and they have incredible character. And that's a testament to the people of this state, and that part of it was the best takeaway from today.\nThank you, Governor. And we have with us, as well, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Secretary Shulkin.\nSECRETARY SHULKIN: Good afternoon. We have over 528,000 veterans in the affected area, and the Department of Veterans Affairs is here to make sure that they're getting the care they need.\nOur medical centers have remained open throughout Texas and Louisiana. And although some of our out-patient centers have been damaged, every day, we're getting more and more of those opened up. I'm very proud of the men and women that serve in the Department of Veterans Affairs to make sure that fulfill that mission.\nAs many people said, today was an amazing day, and I was honored to be with the Vice President and Mrs. Pence, and the Governor and my fellow Cabinet members.\nWherever we went today we saw amazing volunteers. And no surprise, many of them were veterans. And again, those people who have stood up to serve their country -- put their life on their country -- continue to serve even after they come back. Veterans are amazing people who are giving to their community, and I was so proud to be with them today and to be able to see this firsthand.\nI'm now going to turn this back to the Vice President who will take some questions.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Questions for me or for the Governor from any of the press.\nQ: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Darlene Superville, Associated Press. How soon will the administration send its initial disaster aid request to Congress? How large will it be? And do you think this funding should be offset by budget cuts? Thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Darlene. And let me say that the administration has already been in contact with members of Congress about a supplemental appropriations bill to deal with the immediate needs of federal assistance for individuals, as well as assistance to businesses that are recovering in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. And we expect Congress to move quickly on the initial legislation, and we'll be working very diligently in the opening weeks of Congress to accomplish that.\nBut let me say we're very confident that members of Congress in both political parties appreciate the historic nature of this storm and understand the enormous burden that it's placed on families and communities here in Texas. And we anticipate strong and bipartisan support for that measure.\nI will tell you that decisions with regard to overall budgeting will be based on decisions that are made by members of Congress and by the President.\nBut as I've done in the past, I look forward to strongly supporting the President's leadership as we make sure that Texas in real-time -- because we're still in the midst of rescue option and a recovery operation that's unfolding before us -- that in real-time has the resources, and that no Texan should doubt as they apply for available federal assistance, no small business or business that's affected should doubt that this administration, this Congress will come together and make sure those resources are there.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, Matthew Seedorf, NBC/Fox San Antonia. We've spoken to numerous people that have lost everything from this hurricane. I'm sure you have, as well. And they're terrified because they say FEMA is not getting back to them. What advice do you have for them specifically?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm going to ask Elaine to come forward. But at this point I can tell you as of this morning, we have actually had more than 311,000 citizens who have gone online or telephoned in to register for disaster assistance. And I am pleased and I think Texans should be encouraged to know that we've already distributed more than $530 million in assistance.\nBut as we focus on the rescue operation, and as of this morning there were still 900 calls per hour coming in, and saving lives has been the number one priority of the Governor, of the President, of all of us, and continues to be. We just urge people to take every opportunity that they have -- whether it's by telephone or online -- to apply for that federal assistance and know that help is on the way.\nAnd we'll make sure that every Texan and every Texas business that it is entitled to federal support receives that support.\nElaine, did you want to add to that?\nACTING SECRETARY DUKE: Yes. I support everything the Vice President said. If you can get online, the best way to apply is online because you can enter a lot of the data that way. You're insurance, how to get back to you -- that is the best way if it's possible. If not, use the phone banks.\nWe are -- I'll call it triaging. So there's people that have mortgage payments due that are currently not in situations where they need immediate assistance, so we are prioritizing based on that. Additionally, one of the challenges of individual assistance for this disaster is going to be the broad scope of where the floods were and how long the flood waters are lasting.\nSo we can't even get in there to start looking at damage to homes yet.\nBut I would say if you have immediate needs, call back. We're setting up a joint office here where all the federal resources. If you haven't heard back in a day or two and would like to check on your application online or call and follow up. But if you're not a priority, it could take a couple days.\nGOVERNOR ABBOTT: I want to add one important piece of information, and that is to go online go to DisasterAssistance.gov -- DisasterAssistance.gov. If you're in one of the counties that's been declared a federal disaster, you can get assistance. And we urge you to go online and register as quickly as possible at DisasterAssistance.gov.\nQ: Mr. Vice President, Jennifer Jacobs from Bloomberg News. Going back to offsets, sir, do you still stand by your position from 2005 that disaster relief funding should be offset by cuts elsewhere? And can you tell us what the Trump administration's position will be on offsets, please?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I know that President Trump's top priority right now is focusing on rescue and recovery efforts. We're going to be working very diligently -- and already begun to work with the Congress to make sure that full resources to backstop those efforts, to provide for recovery, and ultimately to provide for rebuilding communities that have been devastated by Hurricane Harvey is there.\nI was very pleased. Before I was a Vice President, before I was a governor, I was a member of Congress. And I was very pleased to support federal disaster funding in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. But in the months that followed that, I was also part of an effort in Congress to find savings in the budget to pay for that. And I would leave those decisions to members of Congress and to the President of the United States, as we move forward.\nBut I can tell you right now that the focus of President Trump, myself, the focus of this governor, our entire administration, and I believe the focus of every member of Congress, the local congressman of whom is with us today, Congressman Blake Farenthold, will be to work together on a bipartisan basis and make sure that none of the families that are feeling that anxiety we just heard about in the last question have any reason to be concerned that the resources will be there, the assistance that the American people have approved will be available. And as communities prepare to recover and to rebuild, I'm very confident that members of both political parties will work with our administration to move the legislation forward to rebuild Texas bigger and better than ever before.\nQ: Hi, Mr. Vice President, Elizabeth Landers representing the network pool today. Just wondering after seeing the damage here today with your members of the Cabinet, what do you think is going to be the hardest part of rebuilding Texas? Anything specific?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I will tell you -- and I know I speak for everyone gathered here -- that the sights and sounds and conversations we had today were just overwhelming. I think the resilience of the people of Texas has been inspiring. To see people who have gone through the horror of one of the largest natural disasters in American history, to be standing shoulder-to-shoulder, passing out food to their neighbors, helping their neighbors clear out their homes with a smile on their faces, it's humbling to me. And it's deeply inspiring.\nBut I would tell you the long term challenge here will be -- is getting people back into their communities and into their homes. When we were in Rockport today, as I shared with the Governor, we heard from families and some high school students that were just very anxious to get back in their school. They wanted to have their senior year in their school in Rockport.\nAnd we talked to families that were anxious to get back in their homes. I know as of this morning, FEMA had prepositioned some 2,000 manufactured homes. We've ordered another 4,000. We're looking to secure additional housing. The priority will be once we work our way through the rescue efforts, which are ongoing, and we move through recovery and then rebuilding, the priority of our administration working very closely with Governor Abbott and his administration is to get people back in their communities, get people back on their streets as quickly as possible.\nAnd so housing and finding available housing will be a long-term challenge. But again, the sheer magnitude of this storm, its impacts that we saw on the ground from the air are not lost on anyone here. The President was deeply moved by the suffering and the struggle of the people of Texas when he was here on Tuesday. And he and the First Lady will be returning this Saturday.\nAnd we're just going to stay with the people of Texas all the way through in not just the weeks and months but very likely the years that it will take for us to rebuild southeast Texas -- and we know we will with these good and strong people -- bigger and better than ever before.\nThank you all very much.", "timestamp": "2017-08-31", "title": "Remarks in a Question and Answer Session by the Vice President, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas and Cabinet Members on Hurricane Harvey Relief Efforts in Corpus Christi, Texas"}

Substance abuse robs Americans of their potential, shatters their families, and tears apart our communities. My Administration is committed to lifting our Nation from this tragic reality.\nSubstance addiction affects people of every class, creed, and color. More than 20 million Americans are addicted to alcohol or other drugs, and countless more lives have been touched as a consequence of substance abuse.\nTogether, however, we can fight drug and alcohol abuse. This month, we emphasize to all those suffering that recovery is possible. My Administration is taking a proactive approach to support State and local communities as they work on the front lines to prevent substance use and addiction and to promote recovery. To date, we have dedicated more than $500 million to strengthening prevention programs, expanding access to evidence-based addiction treatment, and building networks of recovery support services across our Nation. And earlier this year, I established the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis to help guide the Federal Government's response to drug abuse and drug addiction, with a particular focus on the opioid epidemic that is currently afflicting our country.\nSolving our Nation's drug and alcohol problems requires both a strong public health response and a strong public safety response that stems the flow of illicit drugs into our communities. I have, therefore, requested $2.6 billion in my 2018 budget proposal for border security and infrastructure that will improve our ability to protect Americans and the homeland from the dangers of drug trafficking.\nDuring National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, and throughout the year, let us remember those who have bravely conquered their addiction. We also pray for those currently suffering so they may, through effective treatment and the strength of family and friends, transform their lives. Finally, let us also thank the family members, friends, and healthcare providers who provide much-needed assistance, encouragement, and love to support Americans in recovery.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2017 as National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\nDONALD J.

{"author": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=128168", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n3:01 P.M. EDT\nMS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. I know most of you, and more importantly the American people, have many questions related to Hurricane Harvey.\nAnd as you all know, the President was in Corpus Christi and Austin earlier this week, and today at the President's direction, the Vice President, Mrs. Pence, and five Cabinet secretaries are back in Texas meeting with local officials and storm survivors, and thanking many of the first responders and other volunteers.\nThe President's team here has been working around the clock to support state and local authorities following the storm. And now, I want to bring up Tom Bossert, the President's Homeland Security Advisor, to provide and update on the administration-wide effort to support the recovery and relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.\nHe'll make a few opening remarks and then stay to take questions specific to the storm and what the administration is doing to help the state and local authorities and the people of Texas and Louisiana. And as always, after Tom speaks and takes your questions, I'll be back up here to take questions on other topics.\nThanks, guys.\nMR. BOSSERT: Thanks, Sarah. Let me see if I can start by addressing maybe some different audiences. We've got international audience, national audience, state and local audience, and I want to see if I can speak to each one of them with a brief update and where we stand.\nFrom the international perspective, we've had heads of state from a lot of different countries. In particular, I would stress today, yesterday the heads of state of Mexico and Canada called to express their condolences, their prayers and thoughts, but also assistance if they could lend anything to the effort. We very much appreciate that, and the President was deeply touched by those phone calls.\nI joined him for the call from Justin Trudeau just moments ago, and we appreciate the neighborly gesture quite seriously. And it's an international expression of what we're seeing here at a very local level. We've got neighbors helping neighbors in Texas and Louisiana, but also neighbors that aren't in close proximity internationally expressing help to our international neighbors, though Canada and Mexico are also offering their condolences, and we very much appreciate it.\nWe're seeing deployed assets now from a lot of states. I know we've got 28, for instance, search and rescue teams and taskforces from, I think, 16 different states all sending down their support to Texas. That's a pretty large activation. In fact, I believe that that's the first time we've activated all the task forces since 9/11.\nSo this is an all-hands-on-deck operation, and it's not just a federal one. There are state and local officials from all walks -- even from Pennsylvania, where I'm from, there are people now addressing this problem by getting their hands dirty and going right down to Texas to help. So we want to stop and say thank you to them for that.\nAnd then, if I can move to the nation, many of you are watching this and you want to hear from us what we're doing. I want to make sure you understand that you should continue to have confidence in what we're doing as a government. There are significant commodity numbers and numbers of personnel and materiel moving into this affected region, and it's an increasing number every day as we move forward.\nBut I would be remiss if I didn't stop and say that none of that matters if you're an affected individual. So 10,000 liters of water doesn't matter if I don't have the one liter I need to drink right now.\nAnd so if I could, I'd like to stop and give a message or two directly to the people who need the assistance. If I can, this might sound a little bit mundane from a White House podium, but if you're in need of assistance and you have access to a functioning computer, if you can get to a shelter or someplace where you can do this, it's very important that you go to www.DisasterAssistance.gov. You can find what you need there to register for the assistance that you might need.\nIf you don't have access but you can find a working telephone, 1-800-462-7585. Again, 1-800-462-7585. There's another number that FEMA has given us of 621-3362. I'm going to clarify and say -- I think 621 -- 1-800-621-3362, that's the number -- 3362 spells FEMA. That second number of 7585 is the TTY number.\nI want to make sure that people use those numbers and use those resources to register. I'd also like to give them the advice that it's never too early to call your insurance adjustor, make sure if you have property loss or damage, you've got the process underway. It can take some time. There's going to be a high volume of calls, and we want to make sure your needs are attended to as soon as possible.\nSo that's where we stand right now. I'd like to go through a few additional messages.\nLifesaving and life-sustaining operations are still underway. We've seen some hospitals suffer some damage in Beaumont. Most of you that are tracking the event have seen that. The DOD and the HHS officials responsible for coordinating the federal response here are actively figuring out and deploying resources to help move those patients to a better definitive care location. So we will see probably upwards of 7,000 estimated patients moved into better and safer definitive care hospitals elsewhere in Texas. And we'll see that happen expeditiously, and I'm quite comfortable with where those operations stand.\nSecondly, a little word of caution: A lot of lost lives end up in this time zone right after a response. We lose, unfortunately, some lives in an immediate disaster, but then in the immediate response and recovery phase, people will use chainsaws, people will remove debris, people will be stressed. The elderly, when they're stressed, you heard Dr. Fauci say, tend to get sick. That sickness can lead to death, unfortunately.\nAnd so, unfortunately, we will see additional losses of life if history is any precedent here -- or if that history is any prologue, we will see additional loss of life. So please try to avoid that, try to avoid strain and stress. Try to get to where there's food, water, and shelter, and take care of yourself so that you can then take care of others.\nWith that, I'd like to suggest that from the FEMA perspective, they're continuing that operation. But from the White House, it's important that we look at the cost of these events and that we look on the horizon a little bit about what's next.\nSo as we look into it -- these are estimates at this point -- but it looks like around about 100,000 affected homes. That's a big number. We're going to have 100,000 affected homes, all with different degrees of insurance, some with flood insurance, some underinsured, some uninsured. We'll have to address those on a case-by-case basis as we move forward, but I want to put a scope and magnitude on this.\nWe're also going to have damage to publicly owned infrastructure. And so what we will do as an administration is put together a responsible supplemental request for Congress -- an appropriations request. We'll make that request shortly. We'll make that request based on the information that we have now. And what we'll do then is come back later for a second supplemental request when we have additional information that would make a more informed total for Congress to consider.\nSo I'd like to stop on that point and take a few questions.\nQ: Question for you. Obviously, after Hurricane Sandy, some money flowed fairly quickly, but the big bill didn't happen until two months after the hurricane hit. The hurricane hit on October 29th; the bill was signed into law on the 6th of January. How important is it, do you believe with Texas, for Congress to get that money through faster? The President promised it would happen quickly.\nMR. BOSSERT: Yep. So three things here. First, you have to look at the health of the disaster relief fund, which is funding most of this operation. That was a relatively healthy fund. It had about $3.6 billion in it, heading into this storm. That allowed us to get through the initial response operations. That drawdown rate, though, is something that we keep a close eye on. We're going to need to go up and ask for a disaster supplemental, shortly.\nWe are also, secondly, heading up into the end of a fiscal year. And so any available money from a regularly appropriated prospective in a department or agency is running out. The end of the fiscal year is upon us. And so Congress had already planned to provide us some replenishment into that fund through their regular course of operations.\nAnd then, thirdly, if there are -- and there will be -- needs for additional funding in the future as those drawdown construction numbers become more clear on the recovery phase, we'll be able to look at them and ask for a third, kind of, bite at the apple on this.\nSo that's where we stand, and I'm not worried at all that we don't have the money right now for the operations underway and the operations that we foresee in the next month.\nQ: Thank you. You mentioned the offers of assistance from the leaders of Canada and Mexico. Will the President be accepting any of those offers of assistance?\nMR. BOSSERT: Sure, you know, the answer here is that the President didn't get into the specifics and neither did the heads of state calling. So I think their primary purpose was to express and extend their prayers and their thoughts and their condolences to those who lost their lives.\nWhat we'll do is turn it over to FEMA and the Department of State to accept that request for additional, actual, concrete or tangible assistance. FEMA then has an office of international affairs, and they'll figure out how to integrate that with the operators. If we have unmet needs that they can offer -- some valuable supply for -- we'll take that. But there's no reason to not take that assistance.\nQ: Can you get back to us and let us know exactly what --\nMR. BOSSERT: I would say yes, but I would highly encourage you to ask FEMA how that's unfolding because you have to look at that from a very specific perspective. I've done that before and the operators have to integrate something very carefully into a logistics chain that is complex.\nQ: Hey, Tom, can I follow up on this question here. You talk about what's next -- the recovery is obviously going to be not just months, but years in the making. This is also an administration that's proposed some pretty significant cuts to FEMA. Are you -- given what you have seen and what the President has seen on the ground in Texas -- are you encouraging the President to rethink those budget cuts? You have been in emergency management a while. Do you think he should reconsider them?\nMR. BOSSERT: There is a number of misnomers on that. So the core operating function at FEMA is going to be well-funded under the President's proposal. The disaster relief fund, which really provides the money for these events that you don't plan for but that you prepare for, those things will be all well-funded through that disaster relief fund.\nQ: So no cuts to disaster relief?\nMR. BOSSERT: But what you will see are responsible proposals in the President's budget for reductions and some Homeland Security grants. Those grants -- I was around for their creation -- those grants were never meant to be permanent. And what we need to do is reduce state and local dependency on some of that federal money, but we need to do it in a responsible way. So it's a little wonky but you'll see not just a request for a cut in money in the budget that the President put forward, but you'll see some additional details that allow the states to responsibly develop a glide path to get off of those grants and their dependence on them over a period of four, five years or so.\nAnd so I would say, understanding that's important for the American people, to know that the President wasn't irresponsibly cutting any money. In fact, he was doing something that would further empower state and locals.\nAnd then I'd come back to reiterate the fact that the disaster relief fund is strong, it's got plenty of money in it now, and we're going to ask for some very responsible surplus supplementals.\nQ: Tom, could you talk to me about the issue of those who are displaced? Temporary housing is a big issue. What can you tell us about what's happening over at HUD, what's happening with this administration as it relates to this? It was a big issue during Katrina, and it was a major problem. Are you looking at issues of finding and designating vacant locations for some of these people to -- some of these victims or survivors to go into?\nMR. BOSSERT: So I met with the chiefs of staff of all of the Cabinet today, and we talked about housing quite a bit. What's happening now is, HUD, in cooperation with FEMA, and state and local officials are starting to get together. The available housing stock -- both available to rent or stock manufactured housing, which often fits a need in this type of disaster, but also available housing stock for those who receive assistance under HUD programs -- Section 8 in particular.\nSo we're trying to put all those housing stock solutions and all those government programs together, think through what's available and how people might utilize that. Right now, FEMA is doing that in a planning section, but their operators are focused on saving lives.\nSo, if I could, one additional point there, this will be a housing challenge, but I don't want to concede any kind of housing -- a lack of coordination. What we'll have to do is allow a lot of this to unfold. And so when I say 100,000, some portion of those homes were affected with two foot of water or less; some were affected with eight foot of water or more. And you'll have to look at a case-by-case basis, the people and whether they're underwater financially and underwater actually. And we'll have to work with the mortgage lenders and others as we address those problems.\nQ: A follow-up really fast. During Katrina there was a big issue of, when the people received housing, temporary housing, rent prices went up dramatically. Is there any kind of safety net or safeguard that that will not happen, that these survivors will not be gouged when they go into these temporary housing situations?\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, you just used an important word and I'll make a really clear point right now. Gouging will not be tolerated. Jeff Sessions and the President of the United States will not tolerate gouging.\nAnybody that is going to go out and try to take advantage of a disaster victim ought to expect law enforcement to come down on them with a hammer. That's not acceptable on a regular day. It's certainly not acceptable when people are suffering.\nWhat we'll do is use the latitude that we have under the law -- to come back to your first administrative point -- and provide a fair market value rental rate that's a little bit higher than 100 percent to accommodate the natural demand and supply tensions.\nQ: To follow up on April's questions about gouging and housing, what about gas prices? Is the administration looking at that in terms of national pricing against gouging of a profit?\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, gouging is a problem if it exists and if it happens at all levels in every vertical market and every horizontal. But I think the idea here on fuel is a good question. We had at one point, in the peak, somewhere around 4 percent of our oil shut in the Gulf due to rigs having to pull themselves in. That number is going to come back online.\nBut again, to take things back to housing, to bring back all the business operations in the Houston petrochemical triangle, we need to make sure that the employees down there have responsible and safe housing. So while there might be some effect to our fuel prices as a nation, right now we're hoping that it's not a large or sustainable fuel price at the pump problem.\nWhat we'll also do is look for the health of the pipelines. So, remember, there is still rain falling. Texas is, I think, not experiencing any rain today; maybe some small storms, but not any major storm. Now Louisiana and the rest of the Tennessee Valley and the middle of the country are starting to see rain storms. The Colonial and the Plantation pipelines, we'll keep an eye on that. We talked about that today in our meeting. And if we have any update on that, we'll give it to you the rest of the week.\nQ: Yeah, on this Crosby chemical plant that's on fire, the local sheriff there says the plume that's coming out of that plant is not dangerous to the community. The FEMA director says, \"…by all means…it's dangerous.\" Which is it?\nMR. BOSSERT: So, if you were there, it would be dangerous. But the good news is, is that the people around that facility had been evacuated already because of the storm and because of the notice that we had on the pending explosion. Some really responsible reporting -- private-public partnership took place on that facility. And what we saw was that the electric power that went to the pumps and to the maintenance systems shut out. We couldn't responsibly get that power back, so the temperature rose in a concealed tank -- or a confined tank, and we ended up having an explosion.\nSo they're testing the air quality as local responders, but they don't know of anyone yet that's in that area of plume that would be affected. So if they were there, it would be dangerous, and they have to keep an eye on it and make sure they take it seriously. But for right now, the people don't seem to be there. So a tree falling in the woods, if you will.\nQ: I have one more question for you, if I may. There are 575,000 undocumented immigrants in Houston, one of the largest populations in this country. Does this White House believe they should be eligible for long-term federal recovery assistance?\nMR. BOSSERT: I think illegal immigrants and that issue has come up a number of times. So if you've committed a crime, that's the priority for the Department of Homeland Security. I think you've heard John Kelly say that, and pretty clearly the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the head of CBP.\nWhat I would say, though, is in terms of immediate life saving: No individual human being should worry about their immigration status, unless they've committed a crime on top of coming here illegally, when it comes to getting food, water and shelter. So the authorities won't be conducting any routine swipes or searches inside those shelters. Those are shelters for food, water, and providing kind of insulation against exposure.\nSo that will happen, and we won't go rounding people up when they show up there. We don't want to discourage that.\nNow, subsequently, our priority will be illegal immigrants who have committed crimes. They're going to be rounded up as they always are, and taken out of this country if we find them. I think that's pretty clear.\nSir, can I go here.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Tom. Fifteen oil refineries went offline as a result of the hurricane. Is it your understanding that they've gone back online? Is this a concern for you? Are there any thoughts of tapping into the SPR because this represents 25 percent of U.S. oil refining capacity?\nMR. BOSSERT: So I don't have an answer for you on the SPRO right now. Certainly, the President will make that decision. If necessary, you don't want to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if you don't have the refinery capability to handle that. So I haven't checked today on the status of the refineries, but I know people have, and I can get that answer back to you.\nWe worry about that, but for right now I'm not aware of any major damage to the refineries, and so that's why I suggested, to the earlier question, we might have an effect to fuel prices, but it shouldn't be a huge one. Don't hold me to it; we'll come back tomorrow and give you a better answer.\nCan I go right here.\nQ: Two questions. First off, Super Storm Sandy, the federal recovery package was around $60 billion. Governor Abbott has suggested this might exceed $100 billion. Does Governor's Abbott's estimate sound reasonable, that this will exceed $100 billion? And the second question is, we've received a lot of sanguine reports about coordination between federal, state, and the local agencies. Can you give me a sense of one or two challenges, areas, where that coordination may require some improvement?\nMR. BOSSERT: Sure. Okay, so on the first question, there's nobody that's wrong on estimates right now. I don't have any information to challenge anyone's estimate, and I don't think that they have any reason to think their estimates are wrong. So we're in the estimate game right now. And as a result, what we'd like to do is not get into second-guessing anybody, and in particular the Governor, who's got the firsthand knowledge of what's happening. But what we'd like to do is a strategy, just figure out the predictable burn rate for the response operations and put up a responsible supplemental request to Congress so that they can meet those needs quickly. So that's the bite-at-the-apple approach that I suggested.\nWe'll go up to Congress and give them a sound supplemental request number. We'll add to it.\nQ: (Inaudible) that might be?\nMR. BOSSERT: I think we've got some internal numbers that we're thinking, but I don't want to get in front of Director Mulvaney as he works with Congress. But again, there will be some regular funding coming in as a matter of plan, because we're headed up to the end of the fiscal year as it is. And then we'll have a supplemental request later.\nWhen we have better understanding and when we can have a better handle on the damage, we can come back with a responsible last, so to speak, supplemental request and get the Congress to give us an informed amount of money.\nQ: Were there any areas where coordination has been wanting -- where you've see a need for improvement?\nMR. BOSSERT: No. You know, I think, at this point, the message is that coordination is happening better than any storm that we've seen before. And so stressing on anything that's not working well really is, especially from this podium, going to be ill-informed.\nI'm seeing nothing but positive. I'm seeing nothing but appropriate coordination. If there is a problem somewhere, Brock Long is going to get his handle around it and he's going to fix it. That's my perspective. So not to be political on that answer, but I don't have a negative word on coordination right now.\nQ: Tom, let me ask you about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 500,000 barrels were pushed out today. The Energy Department says, during Katrina, that, on a loan basis, it was nearly 10 million barrels. So we're talking so far just a fraction of what was put out during Katrina. What is the administration's thinking going forward as to how the SPR will be used? And is what we saw today just a start of what might happen going forward?\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, as I said, I'll come back to you on where we stand after talking to Secretary Perry. I don't have the numbers right now on what we're going to do and why. Again though, I'd caution comparisons between storms. Every disaster is different; every emergency manager knows that. Where the storm hits, what it hits, and who it affects constitute massive changes in how we respond to those storms.\nSo in terms of your structural question though, I think if any need for that Strategic Petroleum Reserve manifests, I think we'd be very comfortable in tapping into that and providing that alleviated resource.\nQ: There's some talk about attaching the supplemental to the debt ceiling increase, some talk about rolling a supplemental debt ceiling increase into an overall continuing resolution. From an emergency management standpoint, how important is it to your thinking to get a clean supplemental?\nMR. BOSSERT: Well, I think everyone wants a clean supplemental. And so, as we tie the -- hopefully, we get a responsible budget, right, and that the Congress comes together and finds a way to take the President's request and meet it. That would be an ideal answer.\nYou're presupposing that we're going to have a continuing resolution. That's not the best way to run a railroad, but based on your question, we might have a CR. If that happens, that's fine. I think it'll also happen -- not fine, but less ideal, but nevertheless fine to my needs as an emergency manager here looking for a DRF supplemental.\nThe DRF supplemental, when you say \"clean,\" should focus right now on replenishing the disaster relief fund and any other ancillary and obvious needs that might come for other departments and agencies for repairing roads or highways of that nature. But I think that will be separate and distinct from the debt ceiling.\nI think we have every reason to believe that that's going to happen in a responsible way as well. And I'll allow Sarah to amplify that if you have any additional questions. But from my perspective now and from the planning session we had this morning, I don't think there's going to be any particular problem in our approach to the Congress this fall. That's at least my sense.\nQ: I'm just a little bit confused about your answer to Cecilia. I just want to go back to that on the idea of undocumented immigrants getting long-term funding. Was that a yes or a no? Does the administration support that?\nMR. BOSSERT: Sorry, what? Yes or no to what question?\nQ: On the undocumented immigrants eligible for long-term relief help. What happens once they leave? Are undocumented immigrants able to get additional help from --\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, so the eligibility standards range across a number of different programs, and the point here would be that, if you are an immigrant that has committed a crime, you're going to be removed. If you're an immigrant, I guess the question is, that's looking for assistance that's eligible for citizens, it's my understanding that you're not eligible in that case. But I think that that doesn't mean we're going to let somebody starve or die of thirst or exposure.\nSo I don't think there's too much of a problem there. I'm not sure where they were living before they got into the shelter. I'd be making some pretty gross suppositions at this point that I'm not prepared to answer. But I understand the hypothetical you're driving towards, just not looking to deal with it.\nQ: Well, the Acting Director of ICE has made it clear that he views coming to the U.S. illegally as a crime and that they've -- people (inaudible) and deported them. And so you're saying that the priority is still to deport people who have committed a crime on top of that. And it's different from what we're hearing from the Acting Director of ICE. And so if you are an undocumented immigrant and you did have a home, and that home was destroyed in a flood and you are in a shelter, what happens?\nMR. BOSSERT: There's a lot of ifs there, and I'll figure that out as I deal with them. But from my perspective, the priorities couldn't be any clearer. So I don't think that I even know how to begin to answer that question. But I will say that there's no real wavering here, and it's pretty clear about our position on immigration. So hopefully that answers your question. I don't think there's going to be a lot of benefits going out to illegal immigrants in terms of the American taxpayer.\nBut I will say that he's also made the point that those that have come to the country and then committed crimes constitute the priority offense that we need to focus on. And I believe that he also said that's not a victimless crime. And so I think that the focus on gangs and other things have everybody pretty well busy right now. And the focus on saving lives and providing food, water, and shelter have everybody pretty well busy right now.\nAnd I think what you'll find is the good men and women of CBP and ICE are out there providing assistance not only to the men and women of Texas and Louisiana that are American citizens, but also, in the interim, to people of an immigration status that need food, water, and shelter.\nSo if I could, I'd like to leave it at that because that's the clear message I want to leave behind to somebody that might otherwise, based on your questioning -- no disrespect intended -- be discouraged from going in and finding something that would save their life. So that's the message for today.\nQ: I did want to ask about the flood insurance program. Before this year, it was -- the Treasury -- $25 billion, and now this. The question is, should homeowners who are in flood zones have to pay even more than they already have been paying in premiums to fund the program? Or should this be a problem that taxpayers help solve? I mean, at this point, this disaster proves that, even if you're not in a floodplain, you still run the risk of having your house flood.\nMR. BOSSERT: Yep. So a couple of questions here, and I'm going to give you a couple answers. First, just for clarity, because there are people right now suffering that are looking for immediate answers. For clarity's sake, if you have a flood insurance policy and you've been paying your premiums, call and get your claim in. There is no problem. There is no shortfall. We have enough money to meet those claims, and you're going to get what you've got coming to you under your policy. So that's the first, I think, answer here from the National Flood Insurance Program.\nThe second one, for people watching this -- you have to understand that that flood insurance program is coming up to be reauthorized. It's about to expire. It's going to have to be reauthorized, and I have every confidence that Congress will reauthorize that program.\nAnd the third part of your question is, how much money is left in that fund under the borrowing cap or borrowing authority. And the answer is: Enough. I think it's $8.6 billion to get through this round of claims and then some. That will push us into the late-fall, winter timeframe when we have to get into discussing what the forecast projections are.\nAnd then the last part of your question is a future policy discussion. I think that this administration has been pretty clear that we'd like to see some responsible reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program. I don't think now is the time to debate those things, as we need to help people that have pending claims. But we'll debate that late-fall here as we come up with good policy ideas to help move that back into a risk-based private sector, hopefully, supported solution.\nBut FEMA has been pretty clear about how to do that and to do it responsibly so as to not throw anybody off that's on that current program. So for anybody that doesn't know, you can't buy a flood insurance program in this country that's not underwritten by the United States of America. The agent that sold it to you might be a private agent, and that's a public-private partnership that has been working since the Reagan administration. But at the end of the day, that standard flood insurance policy that you have -- SFIP that you have -- is underwritten by the federal government.\nSo could I go back -- in the back?\nQ: Can I follow up on Cecilia's question about undocumented? The President is reported to be poised to make a decision about the DACA program. Right now, the DREAMers who were in that program believe that they are documented -- that they're documented to work, have work permanence, et cetera. There are those who are in the pipeline who have applied for extensions or are new applicants. In the time going forward, what is your advice to them about their risks of being deported -- in any of those three categories -- under the DACA program?\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah, so the question is on deferred action against childhood arrivals, and I think what you'll see is that my position today is that the administration is still reviewing the policy.\nOn the second part of your question -- what happens to people that are in an illegal status that require assistance -- I'd refer you back to how I answered the first question: Anybody needing food, water, or shelter is going to get it. Anybody that's here illegally that subsequently committed a crime is going to get caught and thrown out. And anybody in between has to wait for a decision or at least a policy announcement from the administration on how we're going to handle deferred action moving forward.\nQ: Do you believe that that is likely to be revealed in the days that are coming up now, in which you're trying to manage that emergency?\nMR. BOSSERT: Well, I don't know the timing of that, but as soon as the President is ready to announce the result of our policy process, he'll do so.\nQ: Have you been consulted on the decision?\nMR. BOSSERT: I have.\nQ: Can I follow up on DACA? Yeah, just want to ask: What will be the treat of a lawsuit from the state attorney general? Is that going to affect the decision or influence the decision at all?\nMR. BOSSERT: Say that one more time.\nQ: The treat of a lawsuit from the attorney general that sent the letter to the DOJ. Will that affect the decision?\nMR. BOSSERT: It won't affect the policy decision, but it will affect the timing of it. We certainly have to watch the lawsuits and how they matriculate through the courts and when the deadlines would be imposed. That will inform our decision-making process, but it won't affect the policy decision.\nIf I could now, I think it's been -- I see Sarah standing up -- I've been told to turn to -- I think we have Skype questioners. Not that you folks in Washington, D.C. don't matter to me, but for the rest of the people watching, I'd like to turn to -- where do I turn? We've got Skype questioners -- where do I go? Okay.\nSo I think first, is it somebody from Texas that's going to ask a question from Skype? And how do I get that, Sarah?\nHere we go. Sir, you're on. Go ahead.\nQ: Okay, Greg Groogen, Fox26 in Houston.\nMR. BOSSERT: Greg, we got you loud and clear.\nQ: We have, in the Houston area, Army Corps of Engineer reservoirs that are, frankly, failing to protect our citizens from flooding, who are examining that situation. Is the administration considering adding additional resources to the (inaudible)?\nMR. BOSSERT: Did everybody hear that question? I think, just to repeat it in case we're not wired up right here -- I think the question, a good one, is that people in Houston are worried about the two systems, the two reservoir systems that the Army Corps of Engineers maintains. They've been pictured on television overtopping, they've been in a controlled release environment, allowing a lot of water through the affected populated areas of Houston, and you want to know if they're safe and if there's any additional funding needed. Was that the question?\nOkay, I'm going to answer that question, I think that's a yes.\nSo the answer is -- and it just so happens that earlier this morning, almost just before I came out here, I was in contact with General Semonite, in-charge commander of the Army Corps of Engineers, and three answers here:\nFirst, he's got engineers monitoring those systems right now for structural integrity. So what you don't want to have happen is water come over the top and then eat away at the other side of the wall and have the structural integrity undermined in that fashion we've seen in previous events.\nAs of an hour ago, there was no structural integrity determined by any of the engineers that are standing there watching the facility. And so that means that nobody is in immediate damage -- or, I'm sorry, in immediate harm's way of damage and additional property loss.\nBut then, lastly, the question is, do we need any additional money to shore those facilities up? So I would try and answer that a little bit differently. We're not going to get into a position of saying they're safe or not safe, or asking for more money or not more money right now. What we'll do is continue the controlled release. The reason the controlled release is good is it's the alternative to an uncontrolled release. And so it seems like you're dumping more water on people that don't need more water, but if you don't do that, you'll end up with this structural integrity failure that I just referenced a moment ago.\nAnd so, as soon as the water goes down -- and it's rapidly going down right now, we're still going to have some flooding for some time -- but the big, large, heavy masses of water that are going down and out right now are flowing in a way that will allow us to get in and do an engineering assessment over the coming days and weeks. And if there was structural integrity problems caused by the coming days and weeks or by the storm heretofore, we'll asses that, we'll put together a responsible number, estimate for repair, and then we'll put it forth to Congress.\nAnd then very last on that, we'll do it in a way that thinks through a mitigation perspective. You just don't want to rebuild it to the way it was before and then have it undermined again. So when you put federal dollars into a project like that, you want to make sure you do it smartly so that the next storm doesn't cause any structural problems.\nSo that's the way that process will go. It will take a little time for the engineers. But the good news right now for the people in Houston is that both of those reservoir systems are holding up, and there's engineers sitting there watching them on a 24/7 basis.\nSo, thank you for that question, and thank you for doing what you're doing down there. I hope your home hasn't been affected.\nAll right, do I have another question? Is there one more?\nAll right, sir, you're on.\nQ: Hi, this is Justin Sternberg with KTRK-ABC out of Houston. How are you?\nMR. BOSSERT: I'm doing well.\nQ: What will you guys do differently? I mean, we've had disasters all over before. How do you reassure the people of Texas that real help is coming and it's coming quickly?\nMR. BOSSERT: How do you reassure people that help is coming and help is coming quickly?\nWell, there's a real short answer to that. We send help, and we send it quickly. And I don't mean that glibly. When we get requests from the governor, from the mayors, we send in as much as they ask for, or more, and make sure that they're to meet those needs.\nThe reassurance part comes in the kind of pudding, right? The proof is in the pudding. So if we're not getting to where we need to get, we need to hear that. And I'm not immune to criticism and neither is Brock Long, and neither are the local officials there. The mayor has stood up and taken a great deal of smart criticism, but he's also taken a great deal of smart action. And from my perspective, what you have to do is hold us accountable.\nAnd what I think this President is doing -- President Trump is holding me and Brock Long and Elaine Duke and the rest of his Cabinet accountable. And when we're not telling him what he wants to hear, he's going right down to the governor and finding out if we're doing it right from his perspective.\nSo that's the answer. I think it's pretty straightforward. Is there anything that's unmet from a need perspective right now that you want to inform us of? If you do have something, I'm 20 yards from the President. We'll take it to him.\nQ: I mean, not as of yet. But there's a lot of communities that have been devastated here and there's going to be a lot of needs really quickly.\nMR. BOSSERT: Yeah. Let me pick up on that and use that, because that's a great point to wrap up my remarks here today.\nWe are still in response mode, and that means lifesaving, life-sustaining. There are still people up to their waists in water. There are still the elderly and infirmed that require our immediate attention. There are still hospitals in need of evacuation and relocation. We've activated all those forces from DOD and from DHS to move those patients.\nBut we're soon going to move into a long, frustrating recovery process. And the important message for me to leave to the American people and to the people of Texas and Louisiana at that point, is that we're not going anywhere. And all this talk about supplemental funding, it's about having the money in the reservoir of cash -- sorry to use that pun -- to having that money in the fisc for us to use to help you as we rebuild and get you back into your homes, back into yours jobs, and get your kids back into their schools. That's what makes America great. We're going to have Houston and Texas bigger, better, and stronger than it was before this storm, and the resilient nature of the American people is just awesome.\nI couldn't be any more proud to be in this job, and I thank you for your time and attention. That's going to be the last question. A local gets it, I'm sorry. And I appreciate your time. Thank you.\nMS. SANDERS: Thank you, Tom. Finally, before I open it up for further questions, I wanted to be sure and highlight a major step forward in the fight against ISIS. Earlier today, the Iraqi Prime Minister declared that after a nearly two-week long military operation, the city of Tal Afar fully deliberated from ISIS militants.\nThis victory represents the loss of a very important ISIS stronghold, the hometown of a number of top ISIS commanders. We congratulate the Iraqis on achieving this big milestone, and we'll continue to support them in their fight to take their country back from radical Islamic terrorism.\nAnd with that, I'll take your questions. Jeff.\nQ: Sarah, one follow-up on Tom's remarks. He said that the White House will be putting together a supplemental. Do you have a sense of when you will submit that to Congress? And then secondly, can you confirm reports that the President is leaning towards or decided to end DACA? And what are the ramifications of that for the DREAMers?\nMS. SANDERS: I'll take the first question in terms of supplemental funding. As Tom said, we're working with Congress. We're not going to get ahead of Director Mulvaney. He is working with them around the clock to make sure that process moves forward quickly and effectively.\nIn terms of DACA, echoing again on what Tom said earlier, a final decision on that front has not been made, and when it is we will certainly inform everybody in this room.\nCecilia.\nQ: Sarah, thanks. In January, the President said that DREAMers shouldn't be worried. So can you stand here today and say DREAMers should not be worried?\nMS. SANDERS: Once again, when we have a final decision -- this is under review. There are a lot of components that need to be looked at, and once a decision is made we will certainly let you guys know.\nGlenn.\nQ: Sarah, there's a specific report out by Fox that talks about -- that says essentially a decision is made to roll back the program by the end of this week and that there will be provisions allowing DREAMers who are in the country right now to stay until their work authorization expires. Are you specifically denying that report?\nMS. SANDERS: No offense to your colleague from Fox News, but I think that I'm a little bit better informed than they are in terms of when the White House has made a decision. And as I just said a moment ago, it has not been finalized, and when it is we will certainly let you know.\nHallie.\nQ: Sarah, I have two questions just on Glenn. Can you at least talk about the timeline here? You've got these states that have said September 5th is when you will be getting this court action. That's obviously the Tuesday after Labor Day. So does that mean that some decision will be coming down tomorrow before the holiday weekend? Can you at least talk about the timeline for this for those folks who are wondering what their status is going to be here?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get ahead of something and be presumptuous when a decision hasn't been made. We don't know when the final review is going to be completed, so it would be disingenuous for me to create a false timeline that simply just isn't workable.\nQ: So that September 5th timeline is not -- you guys aren't even thinking about that?\nMS. SANDERS: There are a lot of conversations around the timeline and when that has to be made. And again, that hasn't been fully reviewed and vetted and decided.\nQ: And just one more on Harvey, Sarah. There's obviously been a huge outpouring of support from people all around the country for the victims of Harvey. You've seen people lining up to volunteer, and you've seen people donating tens of millions of dollars. Can you speak to what the President and his family have done regarding donations for Harvey relief, personally?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes I can. I had a chance to speak directly with the President earlier, and I'm happy to tell you that he would like to join in the efforts that a lot of the people that we've seen across this country do. And he's pledging a million dollars of personal money to the fund. And he's actually asked that I check with the folks in this room, since you are very good at research and have been doing a lot of reporting into the groups and organizations that are best and most effective in helping and providing aid, and he'd love some suggestions from the folks here, and I'd be happy to take those if any of you have them.\nBut as I said, he'll pledge probably a million dollars of his own personal money to help the people of both Texas and Louisiana.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. Previously, the President had said that he may return to Texas and may also go to Louisiana over the weekend. Do you have an update on the President's travel schedule? We know that Vice President Mike Pence is there today. And if the President is going, where might he go? And will he meet with evacuees while he's there?\nMS. SANDERS: The President and the First Lady will be traveling both to Texas and Louisiana on Saturday. The specific cities and locations are being finalized. Hopefully, we'll have that information for you later today.\nI believe, as of right now, tentatively, he plans to be in the Houston area of Texas and possibly Lake Charles, Louisiana. But again, varying on conditions, that may change a little bit, but that's the tentative plan at this point.\nQ: Can I get one in on taxes before I move on as well? Yesterday, the President went to Missouri to push for tax reform. He has said -- the administration has said that they would like to see a bill before the House of Representatives in September. But there's differences between where the administration is and where House GOP leaders are. Do you still expect that to happen in September?\nMS. SANDERS: As we've said before, this is going to be a big priority for the administration, certainly, moving through the fall. The biggest part is that we make sure that we get it right and that we provide tax relief to middle-class America and that we help Americans across the board. That's the goal. And if we can do that by September, that would be great.\nBlake.\nQ: Sarah, picking up on that -- with the President hitting the road yesterday, he made it seem as if this should be a simple bipartisan fix. However Democrats are saying that there should not be tax relief for those who are the wealthiest 1 percent of earners. Does the President believe that the wealthiest 1 percent deserve tax breaks?\nMS. SANDERS: The President laid out clearly what his big priorities were yesterday. I'll be glad to repeat those: permanently reducing tax rates, encouraging entrepreneurs to invest, simplifying the process, incentivizing American companies to bring back jobs and profits. The President is focused on helping all Americans across the board. The biggest priority he has is on helping middle-class Americans and making sure more of those people keep more of their money.\nQ: Does the White House think working with Democrats on this is reasonable or likely? I mean, they're already laying down the marker for where they stand. You just said \"for all Americans.\" Presumably, that includes the top 1 percent.\nMS. SANDERS: I would love for Democrats to want to help all Americans. I don't know why they would ever want to be against that. Certainly, helping more Americans have more money that they worked hard to earn in their pocket -- I don't know anybody that would want to be against that. So hopefully, they will be reasonable and want to come to the table.\nMatthew.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. I have a tax reform question. But first, just quickly about that charitable donation -- will that be coming from Trump personally, as opposed to the Trump foundation or the Trump organization?\nMS. SANDERS: I know that the President -- he said he was personally going to give. I don't know the legal part of exactly that, but he said his personal money, so I would assume that comes directly from him.\nQ: And then on tax reform, if I may: Secretary Mnuchin said earlier that the administration is going to release a blueprint on tax reform that will then go to Congress. When can we expect that? How much detail will that go into? And how is that -- is that a change from letting Congress take the lead on actually drafting the legislation?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, as both members of the administration and the President have said, our job is to lay out the core principles, the primary pillars that we want to see in tax reform. It's Congress's job to legislate. So we want to work through that process and allow them to actually do their jobs.\nWe're going to do our jobs and lead the conversation, set the table, set the priorities, and let them do their job, and legislate, get it passed, so that the President can sign it.\nJon Decker.\nQ: Do you know when we'll see that blueprint?\nMS. SANDERS: I think we've already been laying out a lot of those principles. That's the foundation and we'll continue to add to that.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks Sarah. Is this push for tax reform a priority for the President and the administration right now? Have you put the repeal-and-replace effort to the side for the moment to focus exclusively on your tax reform proposals?\nMS. SANDERS: As the White House, I don't think you ever get to exclusively focus on only one issue. It's certainly one of the top priorities for the administration moving into the fall. But as we've said many times before, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. And we plan to push through a lot of different things throughout the fall.\nJohn.\nQ: Just one thing, Sarah, if I may: On repeal and replace, as you know, you received no democratic support in either the House or the Senate. As far as tax reform is concerned, are you expecting a different result? Do you think you can get Democrats to support some sort of legislation that comes from both houses of Congress?\nMS. SANDERS: As I said a minute ago, I would certainly hope so. I don't know why any Democrat would be against wanting to provide tax relief for hardworking Americans -- particularly those in the middle class. I think it would be very sad and a big mistake.\nJohn Gizzi.\nQ: Thank you Sarah. Just one question.\nMS. SANDERS: Just one.\nQ: Just one on politics: The President gave a very strong endorsement, through Twitter, of Senator Luther Strange in his bid for nomination in the special election. The runoff is coming up on September 26th. There have been published reports that the President is backing away from that endorsement and not taking sides, which would make him the first Republican President in 47 years not to back an incumbent senator for another term. Is he as committed to Senator Strange? Or has his position changed since the original primary?\nMS. SANDERS: Due to the legal restrictions that I have, I cannot answer anything political from the podium. So I'd have to leave that to outside folks and the President himself to answer that.\nCatherine.\nQ: Sarah, Steve Mnuchin, today, in an interview said -- he was asked about plans to put Harriett Tubman on the $20 bill. He was vague in his answer. During the campaign, the President called this pure political correctness. Is the administration reversing those plans to change the $20 bill?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not aware of any policy change. I'd certainly have to check into that.\nPeter.\nQ: Sarah, on DACA --\nMS. SANDERS: Sorry, I promised I'd come back to him.\nQ: On DACA, in February, the President said he would treat DREAMers with heart. Does the President stand by his statement to treat DREAMers with heart?\nMS. SANDERS: Absolutely. The President stands by his statement. Right now this is currently under review both from a legal standpoint, primarily, and until that review is complete. Again, as I answered before, we don't have anything to add further on that front.\nQ: Would rescinding DACA be treating DREAMers with heart?\nMS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get into a back-and-forth until a decision has been made on this front.\nQ: Let me ask about Russia then quickly.\nMS. SANDERS: Hold on. Let me come to him, and if I have time, I'll come back to you, Peter.\nQ: I'll go right after. I'll go right after Chip then.\nQ: Shifting to Russia for a moment, the decision -- the announcement --\nMS. SANDERS: See, he jumped in there for you. Teamwork.\nQ: Back to the announcement today by the State Department on closing three facilities in this long tit-for-tat that's been going on with Russia. A lot of analysts now say that relations between the U.S. and Russia are at the lowest point since the Cold War. Do you agree with that? And if so, whose fault is it?\nMS. SANDERS: Right now we're requiring the Russian government to close its consulate general in San Francisco, a trade annex in Washington, D.C., and a trade annex in New York City. These closures have to be completed by September 2nd.\nWe're taken a firm and measured action in response to Russia's unfortunate decision earlier this year. We want to halt the downward spiral and we want to move forward towards better relations. We'll look for opportunities to do that, but we also want to have equity in the decisions. And anything beyond that --\nQ: And are those relations --\nMS. SANDERS: Anything beyond that, I would refer you to the State Department.\nQ: Are those relations worse than they've been since the Cold War or at least in decades?\nMS. SANDERS: I don't think so.\nQ: Because the President came in determined to improve relations with Russia and they have just gone downhill.\nMS. SANDERS: And as I just said, we're going to look for opportunities to do that. But we're also going to make sure that we make decisions that are best for our country.\nQ: Sarah, thanks. Senators Grassley and Graham revealed today that they have evidence suggesting that former FBI Director Comey made a decision to not charge Hillary Clinton several months before the investigation actually wrapped up and before they interviewed Hillary Clinton. Does the President know about this? And does he believe that that adds weight to his decision to fire Comey?\nMS. SANDERS: I'm not sure if he is aware of that revelation. But if it is as accurate as they say it is, I think that would certainly give cause and reason that Jim Comey was not the right person to lead the FBI. And hopefully, all of your colleagues will follow suit in covering that story.\nZeke.\nQ: Thanks, Sarah. Just going back to tax reform real quick: You mentioned the President has laid out a bunch of core principles. One of those, presumably, is the effects of whatever the tax plan is on the budget. Has the White House taken a position on whether the tax plan needs to be revenue neutral? Or is the White House willing to accept a tax plan that would essentially raise the deficit? The President has talked a lot about the deficits over the course of his campaign and in the White House. So is he laying down the marker there?\nMS. SANDERS: Not at this time. I don't have any further announcement on that front.\nFred.\nQ: Oh, thanks, Sarah. A couple questions on Obamacare. Some governors today came out in favor of a sustainability approach being talked about among even some Republicans in the Senate. I want to ask you: Would the administration outright oppose any type of Obamacare bailout for insurance companies?\nMS. SANDERS: I can't imagine that would be something we would want to be involved in. But I would have to refer you to HHS specifically on that question.\nQ: And secondly, the President tweeted in July, I believe, talking about taking away the Obamacare exemption for members of Congress and staff. Is there anything that would stop him from taking that action now? I mean, it's something that could be done executively by --\nMS. SANDERS: I think that's something he is certainly still considering.\nAlex.\nQ: Let me go to foreign policy. The U.N. said that last week a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen killed 42 civilians. Is the President concerned about the humanitarian situation in Yemen?\nMS. SANDERS: It's something that we're certainly keeping an eye on, and I would refer you back to them for anything further at this point.\nQ: Thank you, Sarah. The Kuwaitis are saying today that the Emir will be here next week to meet with the President. I'm just wondering if you can confirm that.\nAnd then on the Russia diplomatic move, did the President initiate this?\nMS. SANDERS: This was a decision made by the President, yes.\nAnd on the Kuwaitis, I'm not ready to make an announcement on that. I'll have to check on the specifics of that.\nSara.\nQ: Sarah, the President has made clear that he believes all options are on the table when it comes to North Korea, and has seemed to indicate that the military option is certainly among them. But is negotiating still on the table?\nMS. SANDERS: Absolutely -- \"all\" includes all. So I think that would certainly include diplomatic, economic, and military options.\nQ: And then -- sorry, just one quick follow-up just as we are getting closer to Friday. Can you tell us whether the President still has confidence in Gary Cohn?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes, the President is working hand-in-hand with Gary and the rest of his team on tax reform. As I've said several times earlier today, that's a big priority for the administration moving into the fall. And Gary is an integral member of the team leading that effort.\nApril.\nQ: Sarah, on the issue of repeal and replace: Since this President is so dead set on trying to make sure that he replaces and repeals Obamacare, what's happening with the website? Is there still active enrollment on that website?\nMS. SANDERS: As far as I know. I'm not aware of any reason that it's not, but I'd have to certainly check into that.\nI'm not checking into the Obamacare website daily, so I'd have to look into that.\nQ: I understand. But you're not actively encouraging people? You're more so saying repeal and replace?\nMS. SANDERS: I think that everybody in the country knows that Obamacare is collapsing and that something still needs to be done, and the administration is still very much committed to putting a healthcare system in place that actually works because we know Obamacare doesn't. It's not sustainable. So, yes, we're continuing to move forward and look for ways to help all Americans receive better care.\nQ: And on the HBCU Conference: Is it possible -- I asked last time -- could you give us the list? Because we're still hearing more and more from other colleges and universities in the HBCU community who are saying they're absolutely not coming. And you say it's at capacity and you have a waiting list. Is there any way that you can share some of those names?\nMS. SANDERS: Yes, I think the Department of Education is housing that. But again, I will try to look into that. I meant to do that last week.\nThanks so much, guys. Hope you have a great day.\nEND 3:53 P.M.
