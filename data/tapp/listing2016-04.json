Bill Nelson that would have restricted drilling off the coast of Florida. Sanders voted for the restrictions.\nDuring the 2006 election, Clinton accepted $74,000 from oil and gas interests while running for re-election that year. According to a scorecard of Senate votes compiled by the League of Conservation Voters, Clinton cast two votes in support of 2006 legislation to vastly expand drilling in the Gulf. Those votes put her on the opposite side of then-Sen. Barack Obama. That same year, Sen. Bernie Sanders voted against a measure in the House of Representatives to expand offshore drilling.\nDuring the 2008 election cycle, she was the 6th largest recipient of oil and gas money in the Senate.\nA year later, as secretary of state, she approved the Alberta Clipper, a tar sands pipeline that Sen. Sanders opposes. The Clinton-led department said the pipeline would \"advance a number of strategic interests.\" Environmental groups such as Earthjustice told Reuters: \"It means large amounts of more air pollution, large amounts of water pollution and extra [greenhouse gases] because more energy is required to convert this [heavy oil] into a refined, usable petroleum product.\"\nIn 2010, Secretary Clinton remarked that she was ultimately \"inclined to approve\" Keystone XL, a pipeline that would transport tar sands oil from Canada. During the campaign, after strong opposition from environmental organizations, Secretary Clinton eventually came out in opposition to the Keystone Pipeline, not because of her concerns about climate change, but because she viewed it as a \"distraction.\"\nDuring her time leading the State Department, the agency also signed the \"U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement,\" a deal it said would help energy companies expand offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. The State Department said the pact would help energy corporations expand offshore drilling and \"unlock areas for exploration and exploitation\" in locations between the two countries. The agency said the deal will make \"nearly 1.5 million acres of the Outer Continental Shelf more attractive\" to energy companies.\nIn her 2016 bid, Clinton has relied on a slew of current and former advocates for the oil and gas industry for fundraising support, including Tony Podesta, the brother of Clinton's campaign chair John Podesta. As recently as this year, Tony Podesta has lobbied for BP, the company responsible for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history. He has also lobbied for a company partly-owned by ExxonMobil. Podesta has raised over $130,000 for Clinton's campaign, according to federal election records. According to public filings, approximately one in 15 dollars given to Priorities USA Action, a Super PAC coordinating directly with Secretary Clinton's campaign, came from oil, gas and coal interests.\nOil and gas companies have contributed more than $700,000 to Clinton's campaigns throughout her political career, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\"Bernie believes it is critical that the next president acts to curb the worst effects of climate change by acting boldly to move our energy system away from fossil fuels,\" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. \"He also believes you cannot take on an industry if you take their money. If the Clinton campaign wants to argue that industry lobbyists giving thousands of dollars to her campaign won't affect her decisions if she's elected, that's fine.

As governor of Ohio, John Kasich has restricted abortion access: He signed into law a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy—which didn't include exceptions for rape, incest, or a woman's life. He defunded Planned Parenthood in Ohio, cutting more than $1 million in funding for health screenings and HIV testing. And because of restrictions he's signed into law, the only two abortion providers in southwest Ohio could soon close—making it that much harder for nearly half a million Ohio women to exercise their constitutional right.\n2. Donald Trump promised that he would shut down the government rather than fund Planned Parenthood, which provides vital health care including birth control, cancer screenings, and yes—safe and legal abortion.\n3. This isn't a hypothetical for Cruz: As a U.S. senator, he was?actually?willing to shut down the federal government in an attempt to defund Planned Parenthood.\n4.

This strong partnership has helped the international community ensure that these materials never find their way into the hands of criminals, terrorists, or other unauthorized actors.\nAt the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit, Japan and the United States announced that all highly-enriched uranium (HEU) and separated plutonium fuel has been removed from the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA)'s Fast Critical Assembly (FCA). This announcement follows up on the joint pledge that Japan and the United States announced at the 2014 Summit, committing to remove the FCA material. This effort will result in the elimination of hundreds of kilograms of sensitive HEU and plutonium.\nThe FCA came online in 1967 for the purpose of studying the physics characteristics of fast reactor cores. With the technology available at that time, HEU and plutonium were believed to be required for these experiments. Recent advancements in technology and decades of experience have opened the door for FCA continuing, and even expanding, its mission without the need for HEU or separated plutonium fuels. The United States and Japan have already started on a series of joint research collaborations that will facilitate the ability for FCA to continue to conduct important new research.\nJapan and the United States also announced at the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit that we will work together to remove all HEU fuel from the Kyoto University Critical Assembly (KUCA) to the United States for downblend. The removal will take place after converting KUCA from HEU to LEU fuels.\nIn 2010, the United States and Japan successfully converted the Kyoto University Research Reactor from HEU to LEU fuel. Unlike HEU, LEU cannot be used to produce a nuclear weapon. JAEA has also voluntarily promoted the conversion of several of its research reactors, successfully eliminating hundreds of kilograms of HEU from civilian commerce.", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Fact Sheet: Removal of All Highly Enriched Uranium and Plutonium from Japan's Fast Critical Assembly"}

With wide-ranging applications, these technical textiles can forge protective gear for firefighters impervious to the hottest flames, replicate the sensing capabilities of a smart watch into a lightweight fabric, or detect when a wounded soldier needs to be treated with an antimicrobial compression bandage.\nThis new institute is the eighth manufacturing hub to be awarded by the Obama Administration, building on the President's vision to create a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) of at least 15 hubs across the country during his Administration. Collectively, the Federal government's commitment of nearly $600 million to the eight awarded institutes has been matched by over $1.2 billion in non-Federal investment from across industry, academia, and state governments. The institutes, each led by manufacturing experts renowned in their field, have attracted over 800 companies, universities, and non-profits as members of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation.\nThe American textile industry is adding jobs for the first time in decades, increasing shipments by 14 percent from 2009 to 2015, and growing exports globally with a 39 percent increase in exports from 2009 to 2015. After a decade in decline during the 2000s, the U.S. manufacturing sector as a whole has added nearly 900,000 jobs since February 2010. Today's announcement builds on this momentum in American textile manufacturing and lays the foundation for future leadership and innovation in the production of sophisticated fibers and textile technologies.\nIn addition to the manufacturing institute award, today the Obama Administration released a  new report detailing a snapshot of Federal priorities across 13 agencies for research and development investment in advanced manufacturing technologies. The President's FY2017 Budget builds on the Obama Administration's success in increasing manufacturing research and development by 40 percent since 2011 by proposing to further grow Federal investment in manufacturing technologies to $2.1 billion.\nEarly Successes from the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation\nThe new institute is part of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) launched in 2012. From the very first manufacturing institute pioneering novel 3D printing technologies in Youngstown, OH, to the most recently awarded institute pushing the boundaries on flexible hybrid electronics in San Jose, CA, each of the now eight institutes is part of a growing innovation network dedicated to securing U.S. leadership in the emerging technologies and manufacturing capabilities required to win the next generation of advanced manufacturing.\nEach manufacturing institute is designed to build U.S. leadership and regional excellence in critical emerging manufacturing technologies by bridging the gap between early research and product development; bringing together companies, universities, and other academic and training institutions, and Federal agencies to co-invest in key technology areas that can encourage investment and production in the United States while serving as a 'teaching factory' for workers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs looking to develop new skills or prototype new products and processes.\nThe Revolutionary Fibers and Textiles Manufacturing Innovation Institute being announced today is the eighth institute awarded to date.\nAlready, these investments are generating wins for U.S. manufacturing, including -\n• In March, two photonics companies announced $1.4 billion of investment and over 800 manufacturing jobs in Rochester, NY, leveraging the facilities and capabilities of AIM Photonics, the Integrated Photonics Manufacturing Innovation Institute. These investments are helping revive a region that was once a global powerhouse for optics manufacturing.\n• To help anchor production of new semiconductor technologies in the United States and accelerate the commercialization of advanced power electronics, in March the Power America Manufacturing Innovation Institute successfully helped X-FAB in Lubbock, TX, upgrade a hundred-million dollar foundry to produce cost-competitive, next-generation semiconductors, enabling new business opportunities to sustain hundreds of jobs.\n• Using next-generation metals manufacturing techniques, Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow (LIFT), the institute in Detroit focused on lightweight metals, has successfully reduced the weight of core metal parts found in cars and trucks by 40 percent, helping improve fuel efficiency and save consumers dollars at the pump. In addition, LIFT has introduced curriculum in 22 states to train workers on the use of lightweight metals.\n• America Makes has attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in new manufacturing investment to its region, including helping to attract GE's new $32 million global 3D printing hub and spurring Alcoa to invest $60 million in its New Kensington, PA facilities, both of which will benefit from proximity to America Makes and its expertise in 3D printing with metal powders.\nWhile still in its early stages, the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation is already having a visible impact on advanced manufacturing in America as detailed in the NNMI Annual and Strategic Reports released by the Department of Commerce.\nNew Report from the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) on Federal Priorities for Manufacturing Research and Development\nGrowing and sustaining an innovation ecosystem for cutting-edge advanced manufacturing technologies, like revolutionary fibers and textiles, requires a concerted effort across government, industry, and academia.\nTo foster a shared technological vision across the public and private sectors, today the NSTC Subcommittee on Advanced Manufacturing, representing 13 Federal departments and agencies, released Advanced Manufacturing: A Snapshot of Priority Technology Areas Across the Federal Government, a report detailing common priorities for research and development in advanced manufacturing technologies and initiatives to strengthen manufacturing education and workforce development. Among the shared-priorities identified in this new report are:\n• Advanced materials manufacturing: designer materials that are \"born ready\" for specific next-generation products, approaching atomic precision at kilogram scales\n• Bio-manufacturing for regenerative medicine: repairing and replacing cells, tissues, and organs that might one day lead to 3D-printed organs\n• Continuous manufacturing for pharmaceuticals: uninterrupted production enabling greater quality, yield, and flexibility toward personalized medicine\nLaunched in its current form in 2015—following recommendations from the university and industry leaders of the President's Advanced Manufacturing Partnership—the NSTC Subcommittee on Advanced Manufacturing seeks to identify gaps in the Federal advanced manufacturing research and development portfolio and policies; programs and initiatives that support technology commercialization; methods of improving business climate; and opportunities for public-private collaboration.\nThe Subcommittee's new report captures technology areas in advanced manufacturing that are current priorities for the Federal Government and are strong candidates for focused Federal investment and public-private collaboration. Recognizing these areas is a critical step toward identifying smart, strategic investments that build on our strengths—revving the engines of American ingenuity and honing the skills of the world's most productive workforce.\nAdditional Information on the Revolutionary Fibers and Textiles Manufacturing Innovation Institute:\nTo lead the new Revolutionary Fibers and Textiles Manufacturing Innovation Institute, MIT is standing up Advanced Functional Fabrics of America, or AFFOA, a new consortium headquartered in Cambridge, MA, uniting 89 partner companies, non-profits, independent research organizations, universities and start-up incubators to help ensure that America stays at the leading edge of fiber science and the production of modern-day fabrics and fibers with extraordinary properties.\nThis new manufacturing innovation institute will harness the Northeast region's community of technical textile manufacturing entrepreneurs and innovators, strengthened by a robust nationwide network of manufacturers, to underpin a national fibers and textiles manufacturing ecosystem and position the United States for growing leadership in this critical technology area.\nThe institute will bring together nontraditional partners to integrate fibers and yarns with integrated circuits, LEDs, solar cells, and other devices and advanced materials to create textiles and fabrics that can see, hear, sense, communicate, store energy, regulate temperature, monitor health, change color, and more. For example, the institute will pair the likes of audio equipment maker Bose, computer chip maker Intel, and nanofiber manufacturer FibeRio with more customary textile manufacturers and textile users like Warwick Mills, Buhler Yarns, and New Balance.\nThe institute will work to commercialize innovations being developed in the labs of member universities including MIT, the University of Massachusetts - Amherst, Cornell University, and others, while partnering with local workforce organizations to train workers on how to manufacture these technologies in the United States. The institute will also accelerate technology transfer to enable defense and commercial applications such as shelters with power generation and storage capacity built into the fabric, ultra-efficient, energy-saving filters for vehicles, and uniforms that can regulate temperature and detect threats like chemical and radioactive elements in order to warn warfighters and first responders. The new institute's headquarters in Cambridge, MA will host a prototyping facility designed to help start-ups test their first products and scale up new technologies into full production, to ensure that textile technologies invented in America are made in America.\nThe winning team includes the following 52 industry members and non-profit organizations, as well as 37 additional partners across 28 states:\n52 Companies and Non-Profit Organizations: Analog Devices, Ben Franklin Technology Partners, Bluewater Defense, Bose, Buhler Quality Yarns, Business Education Design & Research (BEDR) Consortium, ChK Group, Corning, Delaware Valley Industrial Resource Center (DVIRC) - Southeast PA MEP, DuKorp, DuPont, EHMKE, Electronic Textile, eSpin, FabNewport, Faurecia, FibeRio, Flex, FLIR, Hills, Ikove Venture Partners, Inman Mills, Intel, Macromolecular, Manufacture NY, MassMEP, Medtronic, Milliken, MiniFIBERS, Ministry of Supply, Nanocomp Technologies, Nanoterra, National Occupational Competency Testing Center (NOCTI), New Balance, Nike, Offray Specialty Narrow Fabrics, Per Vivo Labs, Protect the Force, R&M International, RTI International, SAP, Steelcase, Stitch Texas, Ten97 Technologies, The Corridor - FL, The Solar Energy Consortium (TSEC), V2 Composites, Vartest Laboratories, Vecna, Vorbeck Materials, VF Corporation, and Warwick Mills\n32 Universities, Colleges and Other Schools: Auburn University, Carnegie Mellon University, Clemson University, Connecticut College of Technology RCNGM-ATE, Cornell University, Drexel University, Fashion Institute of Technology, Florida Atlantic University, Gaston College, Iowa State University, Jefferson University, Kansas State University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ohio State University, Penn State, Rice University, Temple University, University California-Davis, University of Central Florida, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, University of Arkansas, University of Delaware, University of Georgia, University of Illinois (National Center for Supercomputing Applications), University of Kentucky, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, University of Rhode Island, University of Tennessee - Knoxville, University of Texas - Austin, Virginia Tech, and Washington State University\n5 State Government and Regional Organizations: State of California, State of Georgia, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, City of Philadelphia, and Industrial Development Agency (IDA) - Orange County, NY\n28 States Represented: AL, AR, CA, CT, DE, FL, GA, IA, IL, KS, KY, MA, MI, MN, NC, NJ, NH, NY, OH, OR, PA, PR, RI, SC, TN, TX, VA, WA", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Announces New Revolutionary Fibers and Textiles Manufacturing Innovation Hub in Cambridge, MA and New Report on $2 Billion in Manufacturing R&D Investments"}

As such, insiders—acting alone or in concert with outsiders—pose an elevated threat to nuclear security.\nTo establish an integrated, graded approach to mitigating insider threats, nuclear and radiological security programs should include national-level and agency- or facility-specific Insider Threat Mitigation policies and programs, training and awareness activities, and collaboration between facility-level organizations. The Insider Threat Mitigation Program should include strong control and accountability measures for special nuclear material that rigorously assess and continually monitor insider human reliability, deter insiders from theft/diversion, limit their access, and provide prompt detection of theft/diversion.\n1.    States commit to supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to develop and implement an advanced, practitioner-level training course on preventive and protective measures against insider threats.\nThe IAEA, with the assistance of Member States, has developed and implemented a basic training course to help mitigate insider threats. With support from partner Member States, and in response to IAEA basic insider threat mitigation course participant survey responses, States will support the IAEA with the development of an advanced, practitioner-level training course on preventive and protective measures against insider threats. This more advanced course will provide member states with hands-on training, guidance documents and related self-assessment and training materials. Similar in format to the IAEA's International Training Course on Physical Protection, the course could be piloted in Member States with appropriate facilities, and then transitioned to Nuclear Security Support Centers and Centers of Excellence (NSSC/COEs) in partner States. The training course will focus on physical protection of materials, facilities, and sensitive information from insider threats, as well as Nuclear Material Accounting and Control (NMAC), trustworthiness program, nuclear security culture, and other methodologies to protect against theft of nuclear materials and sabotage of facilities. Future instructors from NSSC/COEs would receive special preparatory training, and then help teach the pilot course and both regional and national NSSC/COEs may adapt the courses as appropriate to meet the threat-based needs of the Member States.\n2.    States will implement measures to mitigate insider risks using a risk-informed graded approach by taking actions that may include one or more of the following:\n•      Developing and implementing a national-level policy on insider threat mitigation, identifying all relevant stakeholders and information sources, and implementing agency-specific training and education.\n•      Developing or maintaining an outcome focused regulatory approach that will assist those responsible to think more holistically about security risks and mitigations.\n•      Taking specific steps to facilitate collaboration and information sharing among relevant national organizations (e.g., facility security, human resources, personnel security, national security, counter-intelligence and law enforcement).\n•      Establishing or strengthening NMAC programs for nuclear security purposes, and regulations for implementation, including, for example,\no Systems to identify nuclear material status, movement, and changes. These may include appropriate NMAC software, secure electronic data transfer between facilities and to the national or regional level, and established national- or regional-level plans to respond to suspected theft/diversion;\no Facility-level Material Control & Accountability (MC&A) programs to detect theft/diversion through modern nuclear material accounting system software, including peer review of software;\no Regional-, National-, and facility-level programs to conduct performance tests, self-assessments and peer reviews to assess and enhance effectiveness of insider threat mitigation programs to include NMAC systems.\n•      Establishing a nuclear security regime for protection of materials and facilities from insider activities, including, for example:\no Development and implementation of a training program to mitigate insider risk to include topics such as the importance of the individual in recognizing and preventing insider threats; physical protection systems used to secure materials at facilities and in transit; insider analysis, prevention, and mitigation; and how to develop trustworthiness programs;\no Physical protection systems used in protection of materials and facilities;\no Nuclear security culture;\no Methodologies to protect against protracted and abrupt theft of nuclear materials;\no Procedures for materials transfer;\no Protection of materials at the target;\no Access (e.g. two-person) rules and other administrative and technical measures against insider threats;\no Defined physical protection design objectives and/or measures as they relate to sabotage and the potential insider threat; and\no Maintaining good cyber hygiene procedures such as protective monitoring on cyber estate and ensuring user privileges are relevant and appropriate to their current role.\n•      Establishing insider trustworthiness programs that can include:\no Defining eligibility requirements;\no Clearly identifying and documenting roles and responsibilities;\no Conducing background checks;\no Initial and ongoing:\n§ Vetting of personnel by law enforcement agencies;\n§ Medical and psychological testing;\n§ Drug and alcohol testing;\no Detecting and reporting aberrant behavior;\no Process for no-fault self-reporting any condition that may affect an individual's ability to conduct security responsibilities and for reporting any other security concerns;\no Providing personnel assistance programs to help mitigate life stressors that can impair ability to conduct security duties; and,\no Regular security awareness training, including cyber security.", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Press Release - Gift Basket on Mitigating Insider Threats"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122628", "text": "Countering nuclear smuggling is a multi-faceted challenge that requires close cooperation among law enforcement, intelligence and technical government agencies. Working together, these agencies need to be able to detect and locate illicit nuclear materials, investigate and disrupt material smuggling incidents and deny smugglers the freedom of movement. Moreover, as this issue is transnational by nature, governments need strong regional partnerships to help put loose nuclear and radioactive material back under regulatory control.\nThe 2016 Nuclear Security Summit has highlighted this important topic through a series of Gift Baskets that detail commitments made to strengthen necessary capabilities to address the threat of nuclear smuggling. Those Gift Baskets include Counter Nuclear Smuggling (Jordan), Nuclear Detection Architecture (Finland), Forenics in Nuclear Security (Australia), and Maritime Supply Chain Security (United Kingdom). In the last few months, INTERPOL hosted law enforcement officials from more than 110 countries to build awareness and capaicity to combat smuggling of nuclear materials and the European Union hosted 28 countries to share best practices on investigative and technical capabilities to interdict material outside of regulatory control. In sum, these statements and activities demonstrate the resolve of a wide range of nations to prevent nuclear material from falling into the hands of terrorists, criminals, and other unauthorized actors.\nThe United States leverages expertise from across the federal government to ensure its readiness to investigate nuclear smugglers, detect and recover nuclear and radiological material out of regulatory control, and arrest and prosecute criminals involved. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as the private sector, are also engaged in this effort. Each possesses unique and complementary personnel, equipment, capabilities, and legal authorities to respond quickly and effectively to nuclear smuggling incidents.\nThe United States Department of State continues to work with international partners to strengthen their counter nuclear smuggling capabilities, through joint action plans with 14 countries and an expanded slate of workshops and exercises. The Department of Energy supports these engagements by partnering with nearly 50 countries to provide a broad spectrum of capacity-building, including in radiation detection and nuclear forensics equipment and training. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also offers briefings and exercises on integrating law enforcement and investigative techniques with radiation detection technology. The Department of Defense works with partners to strengthen border security and close off transnational smuggling routes through the provision of equipment and training. Finally, the United States works closely with INTERPOL and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to strengthen information-sharing mechanisms for governments to alert the international community to incidents involving nuclear or radioactive materials and the individuals involved.", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Fact Sheet: Countering Nuclear Smuggling"}

This treaty fills a gap in the existing international regime by modernizing the international legal framework for nuclear security, which is essential to our efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction or sabotaging nuclear facilties. The 2005 Amendment strengthens the original Convention by imposing requirements for the physical protection of nuclear material for peaceful purposes in storage, use and domestic transport and security at related facilities. Once the CPPNM/A enters into force, it becomes legally binding and will allow for the IAEA to convene regular review conferences on the implementation of the treaty.\nThe amendment will enter into force thirty days after two-thirds of the 153 states party to the CPPNM deposit their instruments of ratification with the IAEA. As of March 30, 2016, 102 states party have deposited their instrument of ratification; six additional states party must deposit instruments of ratification for the amendment to enter into force.

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123333", "text": "DAILY NEWS: We are very well aware of the broad themes of your campaign by now. So we'd like to hone in on some of the more particular issues to get a sense of how your presidency might evolve.\nYou’ve said that the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of our nation. So if we can get particular: For example, in corporate America, Apple happens to be celebrating, today, its 40th birthday. It's a company that grew from nothing to 115,000 permanent employees. And I'm wondering, is Apple destroying the fabric of America\nSANDERS: No, Apple is not destroying the fabric of America. But I do wish they'd be manufacturing some of their devices, here, in the United States rather than in China. And I do wish that they would not be trying to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. Well, would you name, say, three American corporate giants that are destroying the national fabric?\nSANDERS: JPMorgan Chase, and virtually every other major bank in this country. Let me be very clear, all right? I believe that we can and should move to what Pope Francis calls a moral economy.\nRight now, there are still millions of people in this country who are suffering the results of the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street. And when you have companies like Goldman Sachs and many other major banks reaching settlements with the United States government, as you're aware, for many billions of dollars, this is an implicit admission that they have engaged in illegal activity.\nDAILY NEWS: I understand that. I wanted to draw a distinction, though. Because in your speech you mention the financial industry and you focused on corporate America, the greed of Wall Street and corporate America. So I wanted to get a sense of corporate America, as the agent of American destruction.\nSANDERS: General Electric, good example. General Electric was created in this country by American workers and American consumers. What we have seen over the many years is shutting down of many major plants in this country. Sending jobs to low-wage countries. And General Electric, doing a very good job avoiding the taxes. In fact, in a given year, they pay nothing in taxes. That's greed.\nThat is greed and that’s selfishness. That is lack of respect for the people of this country.\nDAILY NEWS: And so how does that destroy the fabric of America?\nSANDERS: I'll tell you how it does. If you are a corporation and the only damn thing you are concerned about is your profits. Let's just give an example of a corporation that's making money in America, today, but desiring to move to China or to Mexico to make even more money. That is destroying the moral fabric of this country. That is saying that I don't care that the workers, here have worked for decades. It doesn't matter to me. The only thing that matters is that I can make a little bit more money. That the dollar is all that is almighty. And I think that is the moral fabric.\nTo me, what moral is, I've got to be concerned about you. You've got to be concerned about my wife. That's moral to me. That's what I believe in. And if the only thing that matters to you is making an extra buck, you don't care about my family, I think that's immoral. And I think what corporate America has shown us in the last number of years, what Wall Street has shown us, the only thing that matters is their profits and their money. And the hell with the rest of the people of this country.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. Do you weigh in the balance at all, the fact that a company that's moving jobs overseas, that the competitive climate may be such that they feel that they must, to compete in the United States?\nSANDERS: No. I think, firstly, we have to appreciate these guys wrote the rules in the first place. So they wrote the trade agreements. And then, yes, I do understand you can make more profits by paying people in Mexico, or China, or Vietnam pennies an hour, I do understand that. But I believe that people have...and, by the way, I'm not anti-trade. We live in a global economy, we need trade. But the trade policies that we have allowed to occur, that were written by corporate America have been disastrous for American workers.\nSo I think we need trade. But I think it should be based on fair trade policies. No, I don't think it is appropriate for trade policies to say that you can move to a country where wages are abysmal, where there are no environmental regulations, where workers can't form unions. That's not the kind of trade agreement that I will support.\nDAILY NEWS: So how would you stop that?\nSANDERS: I will stop it by renegotiating all of the trade agreements that we have. And by establishing principles that says that what fair trade is about is you are going to take into consideration the wages being paid to workers in other countries. And the environmental standards that exist.\nDAILY NEWS: So you're talking NAFTA. You're talking the Pacific. You're talking all of it.\nSANDERS: Yeah. Look, these trade agreements, let's be frank. Now, people may disagree with me, all right. My understanding, talking to many economists is, NAFTA, PNTR with China, other trade agreements have cost this country millions of jobs.\nYou go to Flint, Michigan, today. And everyone looks at Flint, Michigan today because they're seeing children being poisoned by the water systems. What people forget is that in the 1960s, Flint, Michigan was one of the wealthiest cities in America. Very prosperous city, because you had GM manufacturing plants there. That city is a disaster right now. And that is not just Flint, Michigan. It is cities all over this country have lost their tax base. They've lost their decent-paying jobs because of disastrous trade policie.\nDAILY NEWS: Another one of your potential opponents has a very similar sounding answer to, or solution to, the trade situation — and that's Donald Trump. He also says that, although he speaks with much more blunt language and says, and with few specifics, \"Bad deals. Terrible deals. I'll make them good deals.\"\nSo in that sense I hear whispers of that same sentiment. How is your take on that issue different than his?\nSANDERS: Well, if he thinks they're bad trade deals, I agree with him. They are bad trade deals. But we have some specificity and it isn’t just us going around denouncing bad trade. In other words, I do believe in trade. But it has to be based on principles that are fair. So if you are in Vietnam, where the minimum wage is 65ў an hour, or you're in Malaysia, where many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in slave-like conditions, no, I'm not going to have American workers \"competing\" against you under those conditions. So you have to have standards. And what fair trade means to say that it is fair. It is roughly equivalent to the wages and environmental standards in the United States.\nDAILY NEWS: At what point in history, in the recent history of the United States, do you think the balance began to tip against the American worker?\nSANDERS: In the early '70s. I think it was in the late '60s/early '70s. I think Lyndon Johnson's, maybe even earlier than that, the victory over Goldwater, in '64 got the ruling class in this country very nervous.\nAnd I think there became a very organized effort, on the part of corporate America, and very powerful forces, to say, \"Look, we are in trouble. And we're going to have to fight back.\" And I think what you have seen in a number of ways, trade being one way, attacks on trade unions being another way, to really reestablish and strengthen the power of the few against the many.\nDAILY NEWS: And do you trace all of that, do you ascribe, are those the forces in your mind that have led to wage stagnation since then?\nSANDERS: I think there's been a very concerted effort to take on trade unions. No question about that. You're seeing that every day, or in the last few years, in Wisconsin, what the governor there, Scott Walker, is about. That is a perfect metaphor for what I think corporate America...much, I'm not going to say all of, but much of corporate America has wanted to privatize everything that can be privatized. To destroy trade unions. To make it harder for people to get health care. To give tax breaks to the very wealthiest people in this country. Yeah, I think that has been a very concerted effort.\nDAILY NEWS: Now, switching to the financial sector, to Wall Street. Speaking broadly, you said that within the first 100 days of your administration you'd be drawing up...your Treasury Department would be drawing up a too-big-to-fail list. Would you expect that that's essentially the list that already exists under Dodd-Frank? Under the Financial Stability Oversight Council?\nSANDERS: Yeah. I mean these are the largest financial institutions in the world….\nDAILY NEWS: And then, you further said that you expect to break them up within the first year of your administration. What authority do you have to do that? And how would that work? How would you break up JPMorgan Chase?\nSANDERS: Well, by the way, the idea of breaking up these banks is not an original idea. It's an idea that some conservatives have also agreed to.\nYou've got head of, I think it's, the Kansas City Fed, some pretty conservative guys, who understands. Let's talk about the merit of the issue, and then talk about how we get there.\nRight now, what you have are two factors. We bailed out Wall Street because the banks are too big to fail, correct? It turns out, that three out of the four largest banks are bigger today than they were when we bailed them out, when they were too-big-to-fail. That's number one.\nNumber two, if you look at the six largest financial institutions of this country, their assets somewhere around $10 trillion. That is equivalent to 58% of the GDP of America. They issue two-thirds of the credit cards in this country, and about one-third of the mortgages. That is a lot of power.\nAnd I think that if somebody, like if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, he would look at that. Forgetting even the risk element, the bailout element, and just look at the kind of financial power that these guys have, would say that is too much power.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. Well, let's assume that you're correct on that point. How do you go about doing it?\nSANDERS: How you go about doing it is having legislation passed, or giving the authority to the secretary of treasury to determine, under Dodd-Frank, that these banks are a danger to the economy over the problem of too-big-to-fail.\nDAILY NEWS: But do you think that the Fed, now, has that authority?\nSANDERS: Well, I don't know if the Fed has it. But I think the administration can have it.\nDAILY NEWS: How? How does a President turn to JPMorgan Chase, or have the Treasury turn to any of those banks and say, \"Now you must do X, Y and Z?\"\nSANDERS: Well, you do have authority under the Dodd-Frank legislation to do that, make that determination.\nDAILY NEWS: You do, just by Federal Reserve fiat, you do?\nSANDERS: Yeah. Well, I believe you do.\nDAILY NEWS: So if you look forward, a year, maybe two years, right now you have...JPMorgan has 241,000 employees. About 20,000 of them in New York. $192 billion in net assets. What happens? What do you foresee? What is JPMorgan in year two of...\nSANDERS: What I foresee is a stronger national economy. And, in fact, a stronger economy in New York State, as well. What I foresee is a financial system which actually makes affordable loans to small and medium-size businesses. Does not live as an island onto themselves concerned about their own profits. And, in fact, creating incredibly complicated financial tools, which have led us into the worst economic recession in the modern history of the United States.\nDAILY NEWS: I get that point. I'm just looking at the method because, actions have reactions, right? There are pluses and minuses. So, if you push here, you may get an unintended consequence that you don't understand. So, what I'm asking is, how can we understand? If you look at JPMorgan just as an example, or you can do Citibank, or Bank of America. What would it be? What would that institution be? Would there be a consumer bank? Where would the investing go?\nSANDERS: I'm not running JPMorgan Chase or Citibank.\nDAILY NEWS: No. But you'd be breaking it up.\nSANDERS: That's right. And that is their decision as to what they want to do and how they want to reconfigure themselves. That's not my decision. All I am saying is that I do not want to see this country be in a position where it was in 2008, where we have to bail them out. And, in addition, I oppose that kind of concentration of ownership entirely.\nYou're asking a question, which is a fair question. But let me just take your question and take it to another issue. Alright? It would be fair for you to say, \"Well, Bernie, you got on there that you are strongly concerned about climate change and that we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel. What happens to the people in the fossil fuel industry?\"\nThat's a fair question. But the other part of that is if we do not address that issue the planet we’re gonna leave your kids and your grandchildren may not be a particularly healthy or habitable one. So I can't say, if you're saying that we’re going to break up the banks, will it have a negative consequence on some people? I suspect that it will. Will it have a positive impact on the economy in general? Yes, I think it will.\nDAILY NEWS: Well, it does depend on how you do it, I believe. And, I'm a little bit confused because just a few minutes ago you said the U.S. President would have authority to order...\nSANDERS: No, I did not say we would order. I did not say that we would order. The President is not a dictator.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. You would then leave it to JPMorgan Chase or the others to figure out how to break it, themselves up. I'm not quite...\nSANDERS: You would determine is that, if a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. And then you have the secretary of treasury and some people who know a lot about this, making that determination. If the determination is that Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase is too big to fail, yes, they will be broken up.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. You saw, I guess, what happened with Metropolitan Life. There was an attempt to bring them under the financial regulatory scheme, and the court said no. And what does that presage for your program?\nSANDERS: It's something I have not studied, honestly, the legal implications of that.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. Staying with Wall Street, you've pointed out, that \"not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy.\" Why was that? Why did that happen? Why was there no prosecution?\nSANDERS: I would suspect that the answer that some would give you is that while what they did was horrific, and greedy and had a huge impact on our economy, that some suggest that...that those activities were not illegal. I disagree. And I think an aggressive attorney general would have found illegal activity.\nDAILY NEWS: So do you think that President Obama's Justice Department essentially was either in the tank or not as...\nSANDERS: No, I wouldn’t say they were in the tank. I'm saying, a Sanders administration would have a much more aggressive attorney general looking at all of the legal implications. All I can tell you is that if you have Goldman Sachs paying a settlement fee of $5 billion, other banks paying a larger fee, I think most Americans think, \"Well, why do they pay $5 billion?\" Not because they're heck of a nice guys who want to pay $5 billion. Something was wrong there. And if something was wrong, I think they were illegal activities.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. But do you have a sense that there is a particular statute or statutes that a prosecutor could have or should have invoked to bring indictments?\nSANDERS: I suspect that there are. Yes.\nDAILY NEWS: You believe that? But do you know?\nSANDERS: I believe that that is the case. Do I have them in front of me, now, legal statutes? No, I don't. But if I would...yeah, that's what I believe, yes. When a company pays a $5 billion fine for doing something that's illegal, yeah, I think we can bring charges against the executives.\nDAILY NEWS: I'm only pressing because you've made it such a central part of your campaign. And I wanted to know what the mechanism would be to accomplish it.\nSANDERS: Let me be very clear about this. Alright? Let me repeat what I have said. Maybe you've got a quote there. I do believe that, to a significant degree, the business model of Wall Street is fraud.\nAnd you asked me, you started this discussion off appropriately enough about when I talk about morality. When I talk about it, that's what I think. I think when you have the most powerful financial institutions in this country, whose assets are equivalent to 58% of the GDP of this country, who day after day engage in fraudulent activity, that sets a tone.\nThat sets a tone for some 10-year-old kid in this country who says, \"Look, these people are getting away from it. They're lying. They're cheating. Why can't I do that?\"\nDAILY NEWS: What kind of fraudulent activity are you referring to when you say that?\nSANDERS: What kind of fraudulent activity? Fraudulent activity that brought this country into the worst economic decline in its history by selling packages of fraudulent, fraudulent, worthless subprime mortgages. How's that for a start?\nSelling products to people who you knew could not repay them. Lying to people without allowing them to know that in a year, their interest rates would be off the charts. They would not repay that. Bundling these things. Putting them into packages with good mortgages. That's fraudulent activity.\nDAILY NEWS: All right. You say also that the big financial institutions and the wealthy have rigged the game against regular Americans. And you've also criticized Hillary Clinton for saying, \"We just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the finance industry.\"\nSANDERS: Yep.\nDAILY NEWS: You've also pointed out her financial ties, if you will, to Wall Street. So given all of that, is Secretary Clinton trustworthy on this issue?\nSANDERS: Let me get back to your first point, about a rigged economy, which is absolutely what I have said. Thank you. You got my quotes right.\nA rigged economy is about an economy, for example, where the wealthiest family in this country, the Walton family of Walmart, pays its workers wages that are so low that the middle class has to pay more in taxes to provide food stamps and Medicaid for Walmart employees.\nA rigged economy is when you have corporations making billions of dollars a year in taxes, billions of dollars a year in profit, and not paying a nickel in taxes. A rigged economy is where you have companies able to shut down as a result of trade agreements that they have written, and move abroad and pay people pennies an hour. That is a rigged economy. A rigged economy is when, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, the top one-tenth of 1% now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. If that's not a rigged economy, I don't know what a rigged economy is.\nNow, Hillary Clinton, I’ll let the American…I’ve tried to run a campaign, which is an issue oriented campaign. Where I have expressed my strong disagreement with Secretary Clinton on trade issues. She has supported virtually all of these trade agreements. On how we raise money. I don't have a super PAC. She has several super PACs, which have raised a lot of money. She has given speeches to Wall Street.\nI have not attacked her personally. I will let the American people make a determination about her trustworthiness. That is not an area that I'm comfortable…\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. Let's take it out of the character question then. If you look at the facts, a rigged economy, Hillary Clinton saying that she would impose some fees and extra costs, and you finding that insufficient. And you’re also saying that she has been taking money, including personal funds, from financial industry interests. Were she to be elected, do you think that the American people could have the expectation or the trust that she would be aggressive enough against the banks and financial institutions?\nSANDERS: That's a very fair question and I think the answer is they will probably have the expectation she would not be aggressive enough. Look, I will not shock anybody in this room in suggesting what everybody in America knows, that Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the Democratic establishment. Alright, you don't get $15 million from Wall Street by accident. She is an establishment candidate. To my point of view, the terms of her issues and views are far, far preferable to any of the Republican candidates. But I think what she has basically said is, not to expect bold change from her. She talks about incremental change. I think that's a fair statement, is it not?\nAlright, I believe that in the midst of the kinds of crises that we face with a disappearing middle class and massive levels of income and wealth inequality, the only major country on earth not guarantee to healthcare to all people, only major country not to provide paid family and medical leave, it is time to get beyond establishment politics. So to put your question in maybe a simpler way, is she a candidate of the establishment? The answer is, of course she is. That does not make her an evil person. I’m not judging her character…\nDAILY NEWS: I wasn't suggesting that.\nSANDERS: I know that. But that's all.\nDAILY NEWS: With a couple of those points in mind, there's a lot of speculation that if she were to win the nomination, would your followers and your supporters vote for her? Or would their absence in the voting in November help whomever the Republican nominee is? Whether it's Trump or Cruz.\nWith that in mind, and this might be putting the cart ahead of the horse a little bit, would you ever consider running as her vice-president?\nSANDERS: Well, I think you have put the cart ahead of the horse on that one. We're in this race to win. We think we’ve got a shot to win. And that's what we're focusing on right now.\nThere are millions of people. I am very grateful millions of people are supporting me. How they will vote, I don't know.\nDAILY NEWS: But are you concerned? Not to interrupt you, about the specter of there not being enough support rallying around her from your camp?\nSANDERS: What I am concerned about, what I think would be a disaster for the United States of America, is to see a Donald Trump or some right wing Republican become President of the United States. I will do everything I can to prevent that from happening.\nDAILY NEWS: Senator, I wanted to ask you. Because you've got this enormous support from young people, as President Obama did in 2008 and 2012. And you're promising a political revolution. But, if nothing changes in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, how are you going to be able to get anything done? I mean the real issue to me seems to be, what happens in the Senate? And what happens in the House of Representatives?\nSANDERS: Two things. We are talking about a political revolution and we are already delivering on a political revolution well before Election Day. What do I mean by that? What I mean is this country, and what I say in every speech that I give, no President, not me or anybody else, can do it alone. We need to revitalize American democracy, get people engaged in the political process, in a way that we have not seen for a very, very, very long time.\nAnd the reason I say that, getting back to the questions right here, is, in my view, the powers that be in this country — Wall Street, large campaign contributors, corporate America — are so powerful, no President alone could do it.\nSo what we are seeing already, in this campaign, is, we have received over six million individual campaign contributions. That's a political revolution, you know that? That's unprecedented, I believe, at this point in the campaign, in history. We are seeing...and when you talk about young people, please do not think that these are 23-year-olds or younger. In virtually every primary and caucus process, we have won the votes of people 45 years of age or younger. They're not just kids. And we're seeing, I think, a revitalization of American democracy.\nI never believed that we could have voter turnouts higher than Obama did in 2008. Because I thought his 2008 campaign was one of the great campaigns in American history. And, yet, in at least five states, the voter turnout in this campaign so far has been higher. So we are striking a nerve. People want to get involved in the political process and I’m very proud of that.\nNow, to answer your question. You can't look at politics as a zero-sum game, and say, \"Okay...\" First of all, if I win, it will almost by definition mean that there will be a very large voter turnout. That's what I believe. If there is a very large voter turnout, I think the odds are pretty strong Democrats will regain control of the Senate, do better in the House. Can they win the House? I don't know. But they will do better.\nBut more importantly, if I win, it will mean that millions of people now want to be involved in the political process in a way that has not previously existed. Every item that I am talking about on my agenda is, I believe, supported by the majority of the people in this country. My major job is to mobilize the American people to demand that Congress listen to them and their needs rather than just the big money interests. That's how you make change take place. For example, as you know, I've talked about the need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. Do I believe we can deliver on that? Absolutely, because I believe that millions of young people and their parents understand that that's what we should be doing right now. And I think if Republicans or some Democrats want to vote against it, they will pay a very heavy political price.\nDAILY NEWS: I want to follow up on something you've just said. I have heard very, very little in this campaign, about education. What do you think about that, considering what's going on in this country? But also very specifically there is a trend in this country of wealthy suburbs being better funded in education than urban districts. In this state, there's even a lawsuit where the plaintiffs prevailed but nothing changed. What would a Sanders administration...\nSANDERS: That was the same thing with South Carolina, by the way.\nDAILY NEWS: Yeah, I know. There's a few of them, but what would or could a Sanders administration do about this?\nSANDERS: We could do a lot. Number one, your point is absolutely right and I think there has not been enough discussion. I've kind of focused on, at the university level, public colleges, universities being tuition-free only, student debt. But your point is a very important point. There is a major effort for a start to privatize public education in America, which I think is a disastrous idea. I think we have got to adequately fund education. I think in the broader sense what we have got to do is make the American people understand how important education is to our quality of life and to our economy.\nSo what does that mean? It means that we have to start off with the lowest link. Right now, every psychologist in the world will tell you that zero through four are the most important years of a human being's life, alright? No debate, really. Our childcare pre-K system is dysfunctional. You've got teachers out there or instructors or somebody, I don't know what their title is, who make less than McDonald's workers. They have no benefits, they’re making $10 an hour. These are the people we are trusting with the youngest kids in America. That's insane.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay, I'd like to switch topics here to...\nSANDERS: No, let me just say that I think education is an enormously important topic.\nDAILY NEWS: No question.\nDAILY NEWS: Can I ask one question?\nDAILY NEWS: Yes, you may. Of course.\nDAILY NEWS: Having lived in Vermont quite long myself and a fellow Vermonter.\nSANDERS: Where’d you live?\nDAILY NEWS: Well, I have a place in Morristown.\nSANDERS: Yeah, sure.\nDAILY NEWS: But when you were mayor of Vermont...\nSANDERS: Burlington.\nDAILY NEWS: Mayor of Burlington, I'm sorry. I guess you're mayor of Vermont too. When you were mayor of Burlington and you revitalized the city to what it is today and you had a lot of opposition when you became mayor. One of the ways you were able to succeed in making all the changes in a very pragmatic way is that you had a lot of grassroots organizations...\nSANDERS: That's right.\nDAILY NEWS: ...that were able to put a lot of influence with local government.\nSANDERS: Yes.\nDAILY NEWS: Is that possible to be able to do that at the federal level?\nSANDERS: Absolutely. And that's something I was just talking in response to your question. Okay. People say to me, \"Well, Bernie, how are you going to bring about change?\" You've got Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan or whatever it is. Are they going to do the things you want? And the answer is no. But the way change happened in Burlington is we had tremendous opposition. By the way, I ran as an independent...it was mostly Democrats who opposed me at that point. We rallied the people in the city, the grassroots organizations. A year later, we won more seats on the city council to give us veto power. And mostly the Democrats understood that the sentiments were changing. They started working with me. That's what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is millions of people.\nFor example, let me give you just a concrete example of that, two examples. Right now, I gather yesterday it was, correct me if I'm wrong, the governor and legislature reached an agreement here for $15 an hour minimum wage. Correct?\nDAILY NEWS: Correct.\nSANDERS: Okay. Now if you and I were sitting here five years ago and I said, \"You know, I think in 2016, there'll be a $15-an-hour agreement,\" you would have said I was crazy, correct?\nDAILY NEWS: I'm not sure.\nSANDERS: Many people would have. But what happened? What happened is a grassroots movement developed. Remember, the national minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, it's a big jump.\nDAILY NEWS: Yeah, right, it is.\nSANDERS: Okay. It happened because people stood up and fought back, alright? In the Congress right now, massive effort on the part of Republicans to cut Social Security, and some Democrats. I formed a caucus called the Defending Social Security Caucus. They haven't cut Social Security. We rallied senior citizens. So to answer your question, that is exactly the model I am talking about.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay, well, now let me...\nJANE SANDERS: We doubled voter turnout. I think it's important to...\nSANDERS: That’s my spokesman.\nDAILY NEWS: Good, thank you. So I want to focus you on some international issues, starting with Israel. While speaking forcefully of Israel's need for security, you said that peace will require an end to attacks of all kinds and recognition of Israel's right to exist. Just to be clear, does that mean recognition of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state?\nSANDERS: Of course…that's the status quo.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. You've called not just for a halting construction of so-called settlements on the West Bank, but you've also called for pulling back settlements, just as Israel did in Gaza. Describe the pullback that you have in mind.\nSANDERS: Well, that's the Israeli government's plan, but I think that right now...I'm not going to run the Israeli government. I've got enough problems trying to be a United States senator or maybe President of the United States.\nDAILY NEWS: No, but if you are President, you will, I assume, become deeply enmeshed in attempting the peace process.\nSANDERS: I assume that's something...\nDAILY NEWS: And where you start on the negotiations is important.\nSANDERS: Here's the main point that I want to make. I lived in Israel. I have family in Israel. I believe 100% not only in Israel's right to exist, a right to exist in peace and security without having to face terrorist attacks. But from the United States' point of view, I think, long-term, we cannot ignore the reality that you have large numbers of Palestinians who are suffering now, poverty rate off the charts, unemployment off the charts, Gaza remaining a destroyed area. And I think that for long-term peace in that region, and God knows nobody has been successful in that for 60 years, but there are good people on both sides, and Israel is not, cannot, just simply expand when it wants to expand with new settlements. So I think the United States has got to help work with the Palestinian people as well. I think that is the path toward peace.\nDAILY NEWS: I was talking about something different, though. Expanding settlements is one thing; coming into office as a President who said as a baseline that you want Israel to pull back settlements, that changes the dynamic in the negotiations, and I'm wondering how far and what you want Israel to do in terms of pulling back.\nSANDERS: Well, again, you're asking me a very fair question, and if I had some paper in front of me, I would give you a better answer. But I think if the expansion was illegal, moving into territory that was not their territory, I think withdrawal from those territories is appropriate.\nDAILY NEWS: And who makes the call about illegality, in your mind?\nSANDERS: Well, I think that's based on previous treaties and ideas. I happen to think that those expansions were illegal.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay, so if we were to find Israeli settlements, so-called settlements, in places that has been designated to be illegal, you would expect Israel to be pulling them back?\nSANDERS: Israel will make their own decisions. They are a government, an independent nation. But to the degree that they want us to have a positive relationship, I think they're going to have to improve their relationship with the Palestinians.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay, but I'm just talking about, you’d be getting involved in the negotiations, and this would be setting a benchmark for the negotiations that you would enter the talks, if you do, having conveyed to both parties, including the Palestinians, that there's a condition here that you want Israel to remove what you described as \"illegal settlements.\" That's going to be the baseline. Now, if you're really...\nSANDERS: Well, there’s going to be a lot of things on the baselines. There are going to be demands being made of the Palestinian folks as well. When you sit down and negotiate, obviously...\nDAILY NEWS: And what are those demands?\nSANDERS: Well, for a start, the absolute condemnation of all terrorist attacks. The idea that in Gaza there were buildings being used to construct missiles and bombs and tunnels, that is not where foreign aid should go. Foreign aid should go to housing and schools, not the development of bombs and missiles.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. Now, you have obviously condemned Hamas for indiscriminate rocket attacks and the construction of the military tunnels. But you've also criticized Israel for what you described as a disproportionate response.\nSANDERS: Yep.\nDAILY NEWS: And I'm going to look at 2014, which was the latest conflict. What should Israel have done instead?\nSANDERS: You're asking me now to make not only decisions for the Israeli government but for the Israeli military, and I don't quite think I'm qualified to make decisions. But I think it is fair to say that the level of attacks against civilian areas...and I do know that the Palestinians, some of them, were using civilian areas to launch missiles. Makes it very difficult. But I think most international observers would say that the attacks against Gaza were indiscriminate and that a lot of innocent people were killed who should not have been killed. Look, we are living, for better or worse, in a world of high technology, whether it's drones out there that could, you know, take your nose off, and Israel has that technology. And I think there is a general belief that, with that technology, they could have been more discriminate in terms of taking out weapons that were threatening them.\nDAILY NEWS: Do you support the Palestinian leadership's attempt to use the International Criminal Court to litigate some of these issues to establish that, in their view, Israel had committed essentially war crimes?\nSANDERS: No.\nDAILY NEWS: Why not?\nSANDERS: Why not?\nDAILY NEWS: Why not, why it...\nSANDERS: Look, why don't I support a million things in the world? I'm just telling you that I happen to believe...anybody help me out here, because I don't remember the figures, but my recollection is over 10,000 innocent people were killed in Gaza. Does that sound right?\nDAILY NEWS: I think it's probably high, but we can look at that.\nSANDERS: I don't have it in my number...but I think it's over 10,000. My understanding is that a whole lot of apartment houses were leveled. Hospitals, I think, were bombed. So yeah, I do believe and I don't think I'm alone in believing that Israel's force was more indiscriminate than it should have been.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. We will check the facts. I don't want to venture a number that I'm not sure on, but we will check those facts. Now, talk about Hamas. What is it? Is it a terrorist organization?\nSANDERS: Yes.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. Hezbollah too?\nSANDERS: Yes.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. Now switching more broadly to the Middle East and some of the other troubled areas, with ISIS. The Obama administration has been using this drone program, right? What are your thoughts on that, their use of...\nSANDERS: Well, first off, let me just talk about the Middle East. I talked about one of the differences that exists between Secretary Clinton and myself. I think we can argue reasonably that the most important and significant and far-reaching debate that we've had on foreign policy in this country in recent years was on the war in Iraq. Not only did I vote against the war in Iraq, not only did I lead the opposition to the war, helped lead the opposition to the war in Iraq, if you look at the statements that I made on the floor of the House in 2002, sadly to say, much of what I feared would happen actually has happened. Hillary Clinton's views were very different. She supported the war in Iraq.\nNow, in terms of ISIS, this is a barbaric organization that obviously has got to be destroyed. But it must and can be destroyed without the United States getting involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East, something that I fear very, very much.\nSo my view is that, very similar to what King Abdullah of Jordan said, that essentially the war against ISIS is a war over the soul of Islam. And the war must be won by Muslim troops on the ground with the support of the United States and other major powers. That is what I believe. And I think President Obama, who has been criticized roundly by Republicans and others for being \"too soft,\" \"too weak,\" whatever. In fact, that strategy is, under very difficult circumstances, actually beginning to prove to be a success. ISIS has lost about 40% of the territory it controlled in Iraq. We've seen the Iraqi army maybe, maybe God willing [knocks on wood], show some fighting spirit, being able to take back Ramadi. And so, we've seen some success.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay, while we were sitting here, I double-checked the facts. It's the miracle of the iPhone. My recollection was correct. It was about 2,300, I believe, killed, and 10,000 wounded. President Obama has taken the authority for drone attacks away from the CIA and given it to the U.S. military. Some say that that has caused difficulties in zeroing in on terrorists, their ISIS leaders. Do you believe that he's got the right policy there?\nSANDERS: I don't know the answer to that. What I do know is that drones are a modern weapon. When used effectively, when taking out ISIS or terrorist leaders, that's pretty impressive. When bombing wedding parties of innocent people and killing dozens of them, that is, needless to say, not effective and enormously counterproductive. So whatever the mechanism, whoever is in control of that policy, it has to be refined so that we are killing the people we want to kill and not innocent collateral damage.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. American Special Forces recently killed a top ISIS commander, after they'd hoped to capture him. They felt, from what the news reports were, that they had no choice at that. What would you do with a captured ISIS commander?\nSANDERS: Imprison him.\nDAILY NEWS: Where?\nSANDERS: And try to get as much information out of him. If the question leads us to Guantanamo...\nDAILY NEWS: Well, no, separate and apart from Guantanamo, it could be there, it could be anywhere. Where would a President Sanders imprison, interrogate? What would you do?\nSANDERS: Actually I haven't thought about it a whole lot. I suppose, somewhere near the locale where that person was captured. The best location where that individual would be safely secured in a way that we can get information out of him.\nDAILY NEWS: Would it be in the United States?\nSANDERS: Would it be in the United States? It could be, yeah.\nDAILY NEWS: Yeah. I mean, some of these places are lawless lands. You've got Libya, you've got Yemen. If Special Forces...\nSANDERS: If the question is do I believe that terrorists could be safely imprisoned in the United States, the answer is yes.\nDAILY NEWS: Yeah. Okay.\nDAILY NEWS: I have just a couple New York, quick questions. Will there be a New York debate?\nSANDERS: Well, that's a good question. If I have anything to say about it, there would. It's hard for me to imagine that somebody who was a United States senator here for eight years would not be willing to debate issues of importance to New York and issues of importance to the United States of America. So the answer is, we have asked for that debate. I think the staffs are talking. My understanding is that the Clinton people are kind of dragging their feet. So the answer is I would love to see a debate, yes.\nDAILY NEWS: I know you've got to go in a second. When was the last time you rode the subway? Are you gonna a campaign in the subway?\nSANDERS: Actually we rode the subway, Mike, when we were here? About a year ago? But I know how to ride the subways. I’ve been on them once or twice.\nDAILY NEWS: Do you really? Do you really? How do you ride the subway today?\nSANDERS: What do you mean, \"How do you ride the subway?\"\nDAILY NEWS: How do you get on the subway today?\nSANDERS: You get a token and you get in.\nDAILY NEWS: Wrong.\nSANDERS: You jump over the turnstile.\nDAILY NEWS: We would like our photographer to be there when you jump over the turnstile.\nSANDERS: I'm like anybody when I….\nDAILY NEWS: Returning to another New York issue. We're just a few blocks away from the World Trade Center.\nSANDERS: Yup.\nDAILY NEWS: Down in Guantanamo, there's Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect. I believe you're against the death penalty. Are you against the death penalty for him?\nSANDERS: Yup.\nDAILY NEWS: You are. Why is that?\nSANDERS: Because I think the death penalty does not prove to be effective in stopping the crimes that we want to see stopping. And second of all, at a time when virtually every major country on Earth has eliminated the death penalty, for right reasons. In a world of as much violence as currently exists, I don't believe government, our government, should be involved in killing.\nDAILY NEWS: But you place Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, if you do, I'm asking, in the same moral basket as the street criminals under that...\nSANDERS: No. I place him as a murderous disgusting terrorist, and we have seen in this country terrible crimes have been...I don't need to explain to anybody in this room people coming out with automatic weapons and killing children in Sandy Hook. Disgusting crimes. I happen to believe that, in the long run, from a moral perspective, and from an effectiveness perspective, the death penalty does not work.\nDAILY NEWS: But you would have no hesitation about killing him if a drone found him on a battlefield?\nSANDERS: Well, unfortunately we live in a...that's right. There is a difference. If I have you captured and I kill you, it's different than killing you on the battlefield. I think that is a very different moral...but if you're asking me am a pacifist, don't believe in killing people in war, that's not my position.\nDAILY NEWS: So speaking of New York and issues important to New York and speaking of death. Last year, after the Oregon Community College shootings, you promised a comprehensive gun control agenda. When are we going to see that and what can you tell us...\nSANDERS: Well, I've talked about it, you have seen it. What the agenda is is very similar to where to where President Obama is. President Obama said at that Oregon speech…… with a great deal of emotion. That he thought this was an issue that's never going to be permanently solved. Nobody can guarantee that some lunatic is not going to pick up a gun today and kill people. But we have to do the best that we can to prevent those type of killings. And what we do, in my view, is significantly strengthen and expand the instant background check. What we do is do away with the gun show loophole, where people now are buying guns from unlicensed dealers. What we do is do away with the straw man provision, where you can buy a gun legally and then sell it to somebody who's a criminal. I think what we also is significantly expand mental health capabilities to try to address the fact that we have thousands of people walking in this country today who are suicidal and homicidal. So I support pretty much the President's agenda.\nDAILY NEWS: Just to be clear, the press release your campaign put out the day of that announcement of the forthcoming comprehensive plan, you made that announcement, those were the four points you made then. Have you moved any further beyond that?\nSANDERS: Well, I don't know that anyone has moved...I think that's the President's vision, that's my position.\nDAILY NEWS: There's a case currently waiting to be ruled on in Connecticut. The victims of the Sandy Hook massacre are looking to have the right to sue for damages the manufacturers of the weapons. Do you think that that is something that should be expanded?\nSANDERS: Do I think the victims of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer, is that your question?\nDAILY NEWS: Correct.\nSANDERS: No, I don't.\nDAILY NEWS: Let me ask you. I know we're short on time. Two quick questions. Your website talks about...\nSANDERS: No, let me just...I'm sorry. In the same sense that if you're a gun dealer and you sell me a gun and I go out and I kill him [gestures to someone in room]…. Do I think that that gun dealer should be sued for selling me a legal product that he misused? [Shakes head no.] But I do believe that gun manufacturers and gun dealers should be able to be sued when they should know that guns are going into the hands of wrong people. So if somebody walks in and says, \"I'd like 10,000 rounds of ammunition,\" you know, well, you might be suspicious about that. So I think there are grounds for those suits, but not if you sell me a legal product. But you're really saying...\nDAILY NEWS: Do you think that the discussion and debate about what defines a legal product, what should be a legal product, hence AR-15s, these automatic military-style weapons...which is the grounds of this suit at the moment is that this should have never been in the hands of the public.\nSANDERS: Well, you're looking at a guy...let's talk about guns for one second. Let’s set the record straight because of…unnamed candidates who have misrepresented my views. You're looking at a guy who has a D, what was it, D minus voting record from the NRA? Not exactly a lobbyist for the NRA, not exactly supporting them.\nBut it's interesting that you raised that question. If you'll remember this, if you were in Vermont in 1988 [gestures to Vermonter in the room], three people were running for the United States Congress. We have one seat, Vermont. Two of them supported assault weapons. One candidate, Bernie Sanders, said, in 1988, \"No, I do not support the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country.\" I lost that election by three points. Came in second. And that may have been the reason, that I was opposed by all of the gun people, okay? So to answer your question, I do not believe, I didn't believe then and I don't believe now that those guns should be sold in America. They're designed for killing people.\nDAILY NEWS: So do you think then, with that in mind, that the merits of the current case are baseless?\nSANDERS: It's not baseless. I wouldn't use that word. But it's a backdoor way. If you're questioning me, will I vote to ban assault weapons in the United States, yeah, I will.\nDAILY NEWS: Two quick questions. One is your website talks about physical violence perpetrated by the state against African Americans.\nSANDERS: Yeah.\nDAILY NEWS: It also says, \"We need new rules on the allowable use of force.\" Such as?\nSANDERS: Such as do what many other countries are doing. Look, you've got somebody who's clearly mentally ill outside, right? Ranting and raving, and maybe they have a knife in their hands. Are there ways to deal with that issue other than shooting that person? We have seen instances in my own state, all over this country, where the way that was dealt with by killing that person. There are ways to deal with that. So I think what I am suggesting here very forcefully is that we have got to train police offices to use lethal force as a last resort, not a first resort.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. Last question. If you are elected, alums of James Madison High School will be atop all three branches of the United States government, Congress, the Senate, the presidency, and the Supreme Court.\nSANDERS: Well, not quite the Supreme...\nDAILY NEWS: Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nSANDERS: Well, she is there, but she's not...she's like a...yeah.\nDAILY NEWS: Yeah, no. So what happened? What has happened to education in America that James Madison High School is not that type of production line anymore?\nSANDERS: That's a good question. And with all due respect, you went to Midwood...\nDAILY NEWS: No, I live in Midwood.\nSANDERS: Oh, you live in...\nDAILY NEWS: Yeah.\nSANDERS: All right, all right. Midwood was a pretty good school as well.\nDAILY NEWS: My daughter is in Bronx Science.\nSANDERS: Okay. First off, we still have some great schools. Let's not dismiss that. On the other hand, we have schools that everybody knows are drop-out factories, that are terrible. The answer to the question, I think, has to do with devaluing the role of education in our society. I was in Wisconsin just the other day, talking to teachers, and they said, if you can believe this, that young people do not want to become teachers anymore. Because especially in that state, teachers in public education have been so vilified.\nCan you imagine bright young people not wanting to do the enormously important job of teaching? So we've got to change that culture. Teaching, education, is of the highest importance in this country. Teachers deserve to be well-paid, well-respected. When I grew up in that community, this was a community of immigrants, largely immigrants who understood the power of education. We had great teachers and we had great schools. I think we can do that again.\nDAILY NEWS: Okay. Thank you very much.\nSANDERS: Thank you", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Interview by The Daily News Editorial Board"}

It is a pleasure to be here with our P-5-plus-1 partners, the European Union, and Director General Amano of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Because of the nations that are represented here today, we achieved a historic deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And today is an opportunity to review progress as that deal continues to be implemented.\nOur work together is a key part of the comprehensive agenda that I outlined in Prague 7 years ago: stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and seeking the long-term vision of a world without them. That included strengthening the global regime that prevents the spread of nuclear weapons. And one of the greatest tests of that regime was Iran's nuclear program. After nearly 2 years of intensive negotiations, backed by strong sanctions, the countries represented in this room achieved what decades of animosity and rhetoric did not: a long-term deal that closes off every possible path to building a nuclear weapon and subjects Iran to the most comprehensive nuclear inspections ever negotiated.\nAnd thanks to this deal, we have seen real progress. Already, Iran has dismantled two-thirds of its installed centrifuges. Iran has shipped 98 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile out of Iran. Iran has removed the Arak reactor core and filled it with concrete. If Iran were to cheat, the breakout time to build a nuclear weapon has gone from 2 to 3 months to about a year.\nIn January, the IAEA verified that Iran had fulfilled key commitments of the deal. And today, Director General Amano will update us on implementation. Our nations have lifted nuclear-related sanctions and it will take time for Iran to reintegrate into the global economy, but Iran is already beginning to see the benefits of this deal.\nNow, I think it's important to note that this deal does not resolve all of our differences with Iran, including destabilizing activities in the region. Except for limited exceptions, the U.S. trade embargo on Iran remains in place. And we also continue to vigorously enforce sanctions pertaining to Iran's support for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missile programs. That's U.S. policy. But what this group—that doesn't agree on all aspects of policy—does agree on is that this deal has achieved a substantial success and focused on the dangers of nuclear proliferation in an effective way.\nThe road to this deal was not easy. It took commitment, diplomacy, hard work. It took the leaders and countries gathered around this table coming together and working out our own differences in approach. Full and continued implementation is going to take the same kind of cooperation and consultation. But I am extremely grateful to our partners in this effort.\nEven as we continue to face nuclear threats around the world, which is the topic of this summit, this deal does remind us that when the international community stands as one, we can advance our common security.\nSo I want to thank all the leaders who are gathered here, the countries who are participating, Director General Amano. This is a success of diplomacy that, hopefully, we'll be able to copy in the future. Thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Remarks During a Meeting With P-5-Plus-1 Leaders"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 11:17 a.m. in Halls D and E of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. In his remarks, he referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117111", "text": "President Obama. Good morning, everybody. It is my privilege to welcome you to Washington and to formally convene our fourth Nuclear Security Summit. I convened our first summit 6 years ago in this same room because the danger of a terrorist group obtaining and using a nuclear weapon is one of the greatest threats to global security.\nOur nations committed ourselves to action: concrete, tangible steps to secure the world's vulnerable nuclear materials. And we continued our work at our summits in Seoul and The Hague. And I want to again thank our friends from the Republic of Korea and the Netherlands for their leadership on this critical issue.\nBack at our first summit, I quoted Albert Einstein. At the dawn of the nuclear age, he said, \"The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything.\" And he added, \"A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive.\" Over the past 6 years, when it comes to nuclear security, we've embraced a new type of thinking and a new type of action. This is a perfect example of a 21st-century security challenge that no one nation can solve alone. It requires coalitions and sustained coordination across borders and institutions. And the good news is, we've made significant progress.\nWe've made nuclear security a priority at the highest levels. And I want to thank all my fellow leaders, from more than 50 nations and key international organizations, for your commitment to this work and being here today. Some of you were here for our very first summit; many of you have taken office and joined this work. But it's a reminder that the task of protecting our citizens transcends political ideologies, parties, and administrations.\nTo date, our nations have made some 260 specific commitments to improve nuclear security, and so far, three-quarters of these steps have been implemented. More than a dozen nations have removed all their highly enriched uranium and plutonium. Countries have removed or dispersed—disposed of several tons of this deadly material. Nations have improved their nuclear security, including stronger regulations and more physical security of nuclear facilities, and more nations are cooperating to prevent nuclear smuggling.\nLeading up to this summit, nations have fulfilled additional commitments. Argentina, Switzerland, Uzbekistan all successfully eliminated all their highly enriched uranium from their countries. China recently opened its new center for promoting nuclear security and training, and I'm pleased that the United States and China are cooperating on nuclear security. And Japan is working to complete the removal of more than half a ton of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, which is the largest project in history to remove nuclear material from a country.\nI'm also pleased to announce that in recent days, after many years of work, 102 nations have now ratified a key treaty, the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. As a result, we expect that the treaty will enter into force in the coming weeks, giving us more tools that we need to work together in the event of theft of nuclear material or an attack on a nuclear facility. Several of the nations here made the extra effort in recent weeks to complete this process in time for this summit, and I want to thank you very much for helping us get over the line.\nOnce again, I'm making it clear that the United States will continue to do our part. Today we're releasing a detailed description of the security measures our military takes to protect nuclear material so that other nations can improve their security and transparency as well.\nFor the first time in a decade, we're providing a public inventory of our stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, which could be used for nuclear weapons, and that inventory is one that we have reduced considerably. When it comes to our nuclear-powered ships and submarines, we're exploring ways to further reduce our holdings of highly enriched uranium.\nIn short, everybody has been participating, and by working together, our nations have made it harder for terrorists to get their hands on nuclear material. We have measurably reduced the risk. But as we discussed at last night's dinner, the threat of nuclear terrorism persists and continues to evolve. Fortunately, because of our coordinated efforts, no terrorist group has succeeded thus far in obtaining a nuclear weapon or a dirty bomb made of radioactive materials. But we know that Al Qaida has long sought nuclear materials. Individuals involved in the attacks in Paris and Brussels videotaped a senior manager who works at a Belgian nuclear facility. ISIL has already used chemical weapons, including mustard gas, in Syria and Iraq. There is no doubt that if these madmen ever got their hands on a nuclear bomb or nuclear material, they most certainly would use it to kill as many innocent people as possible.\nAnd that's why our work here remains so critical. The single most effective defense against nuclear terrorism is fully securing this material so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands in the first place. This is difficult. At hundreds of military and civilian facilities around the world, there's still roughly 2,000 tons of nuclear materials, and not all of this is properly secured. And just the smallest amount of plutonium—about the size of an apple—could kill and injure hundreds of thousands of innocent people. It would be a humanitarian, political, economic, and environmental catastrophe with global ramifications for decades. It would change our world.\nSo we cannot be complacent. We have to build on our progress. We have to commit to better security at nuclear facilities, to removing or disposing of more dangerous material, to bringing more nations into treaties and partnerships that prevent proliferation and smuggling, and to make sure that we have the architecture in place to sustain our momentum in the years ahead.\nAnd with so many members of the global coalition against ISIL here today, this will also be an opportunity to make sure that we're doing everything in our power to keep a terrorist group from ISIL—like ISIL from ever getting its hands not just on a nuclear weapon, but any weapon of mass destruction.\nSo I am very appreciative of the excellent work that's been done and the excellent conversation we had last night. With that, what I'd like to do is to invite Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands to review some of the specific progress that we've made since our last summit.\nMark. Prime Minister Rutte. Mr. President, dear Barack, esteemed colleagues, and ladies and gentlemen: Barack, your initiative in 2010 to convene the first Nuclear Summit has bolstered our defenses against the nightmare of a nuclear attack.\nThe vicious terrorist acts in Brussels last week only underscore the importance of the NSS process. And it's fitting that we are completing this cycle of four summits under your leadership.\nIn 2014, it was my privilege to welcome the NSS to The Hague. And it's encouraging that we have continued to make progress since then. First, the amount of nuclear material in circulation continues to decline. More and more excess nuclear material is being stored and handled in a sustainable manner, like the recent shipment of excess plutonium and highly enriched uranium from Japan to the United States. And the use of low-enriched uranium for the production of medical isotopes and other purposes is on the rise.\nSecond, the material that is out there is being made more secure as more countries turn the IAEA recommendations into national legislation. Since The Hague summit, 37 have committed to doing so, most recently, Jordan and China.\nAnd indeed, third, international cooperation and commitment continue to grow. And the imminent entry into force of the amended Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material is a great achievement. And this important milestone reinforces our efforts at this summit today.\nI'm also delighted that earlier summits have provided a legacy in two other respects. Firstly, the scenario-based policy discussion we introduce in The Hague was valuable experience. Today we are using this tool again. And I look forward to an informal, concrete, interactive discussion, and I have no doubt it will be just as successful as in The Hague.\nSecondly, there is the gift basket. It's great to see how initiatives launched by one or more countries can bring us closer to a breakthrough. In the past few months alone, new gift baskets have been added on complex issues like cybersecurity and insider threats. Let's keep up the momentum even after this final NSS.\nDear colleagues, this summit is not the end of our quest to make the world safe from nuclear terrorism. The five organizations to which we pass the torch today can count on our continued support and commitment. Should a need arise, I know that everybody here will be ready to return to our roundtable.\nThank you.\nPresident Obama. Thank you very much, Mark, for the excellent summary.\nWith that, I'd like to ask the press to depart the room. And we will begin this opening plenary session.", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Remarks With Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands at the Opening Plenary Session of the Nuclear Security Summit"}

If we could get started. If everybody could take their seats, please.\nJust to summarize where we've been, in the morning session, we discussed the extensive and impressive national action steps that many of us have taken and the collective efforts that we've made to reduce the amount of nuclear material that might be accessible to terrorists around the world.\nDuring lunch, we focused on international institutions. And I was heartened by our collective commitment to ensure that the IAEA, Interpol, the United Nations, and the various coalitions that have formed are properly resourced and supported by various nation-states in order for them to be able to carry out the ongoing work that will be required to ensure that the commitments and pledges and practices that we have put into place during the course of these Nuclear Security Summits carry forward.\nThis afternoon's session turns the focus on the terrorist networks themselves. It tells us the possible consequences of terrorists obtaining and using a weapon of mass destruction. Fortunately, as I've said this morning, no terrorist group has yet succeeded in getting their hands on a nuclear device. Our work here will help ensure that we're doing everything possible to prevent that.\nThis is also an opportunity for our nations to remain united and focused on the most active terrorist network at the moment, and that is ISIL. A majority of the nations here are part of the global coalition against ISIL. A number of our countries have been targeted by ISIL attacks. Just about all of our nations have seen citizens join ISIL in Syria and Iraq. So this is a threat to us all.\nIn Syria and Iraq, ISIL continues to lose ground. That's the good news. Our coalition continues to take out its leaders, including those planning external terrorist attacks. They are losing their oil infrastructure. They are losing their revenues. Morale is suffering. We believe that the flow of foreign fighters into Syria and Iraq has slowed, even as the threat from foreign fighters returning to commit acts of horrific violence remains all too real.\nIn fact, as ISIL is squeezed in Syria and Iraq, we can anticipate it lashing out elsewhere, as we've seen most recently and tragically in countries from Turkey to Brussels. This means that the sense of urgency that we've shown in destroying ISIL in Iraq and Syria also has to infuse our efforts to prevent attacks around the world.\nWe need to do even more to prevent the flow of foreign terrorist fighters. After the Paris attacks, the United States deployed surge teams to Europe to bolster these efforts, and we'll be deploying additional teams in the near future. We all have a role to play. We're all going to have to do more when it comes to intelligence sharing. We simply cannot afford to have critical intelligence not being shared as needed, whether between governments or within governments. And today is an opportunity to explore ways to step up those efforts.\nLooking around this room, I see nations that represent the overwhelming majority of humanity, from different regions, races, religions, cultures. But our people do share common aspirations to live in security and peace and to be free from fear. The fight against ISIL will continue to be difficult, but together, we are making real progress, and I'm absolutely confident that we will prevail and destroy this vile organization. As compared to ISIL's vision of death and destruction, I believe our nations together offer a hopeful vision focused on what we can build for our people.\nWith that, what I'd like to do is ask the press to depart. We will then be showing a video that focuses attention on possible scenarios that might emerge with respect to terrorist networks. It will give us a good opportunity to test those areas where we still have work to do and how we can strengthen our collective efforts against these networks.\nSo if I could ask the press to depart promptly, please.", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Remarks at the Closing Session of the Nuclear Security Summit"}

This project was accomplished on an accelerated timeline well ahead of schedule, thanks to the hard work and strong cooperation from both sides. This effort represents the realization of a commitment first announced at the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague and reiterated during Prime Minister Abe's April 2015 visit to Washington, D.C. It furthers our mutual goal of minimizing stocks of HEU and separated plutonium worldwide, which will help prevent unauthorized actors, criminals, or terrorists from acquiring such materials. The United States will downblend the HEU to low enriched uranium (LEU) for use in civilian activities and convert the plutonium into a less sensitive form for final disposition.\nToday our two countries further demonstrate our determination to make contributions to the efforts to minimize stocks of HEU worldwide by announcing our pledge to work together to remove all HEU fuels from the Kyoto University Critical Assembly (KUCA) to the United States for downblend and permanent threat reduction. This removal will be made possible by the conversion of KUCA from HEU to LEU fuels, when technically and economically feasible. KUCA will continue to serve its important missions in relevant research and human resource development, with fuels that will no longer present a risk of theft and use by nuclear terrorists.\nThe removal of HEU and plutonium fuels from the FCA and our pledge to convert KUCA are part of the ongoing activities of the U.S.-Japan Nuclear Security Working Group (NSWG). Under the NSWG, we have taken a layered approach to nuclear security that involves reducing quantities of sensitive nuclear material, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to nuclear material, strengthening emergency preparedness, and improving nuclear forensics capabilities. The United States and Japan are also sharing and will continue to share best practices on a possible framework for an integrated national response to incidents of nuclear and radioactive materials found out of regulatory control.\nThe NSWG further facilitates bilateral cooperation on a range of issues including nuclear security training, the physical protection of nuclear material, safeguards, and transportation security. The United States especially applauds the indispensable role which the Japan Atomic Energy Agency's Integrated Support Center for Nuclear Nonproliferation and Nuclear Security (ISCN) is playing in the capacity building of personnel from other countries, particularly those from Asian countries, and expects ISCN to continue to serve as a leading Center of Excellence in this area.\nIn order to further strengthen cooperative efforts on preventing nuclear terrorism, and to continue to address Nuclear Security Summit goals, both sides have commenced negotiations on a framework to enable the exchange of classified information in the area of nuclear security, with the shared intention of reaching an agreement shortly. Japan and the United States will continue our NSWG under the U.S.-Japan Bilateral Commission on Civil Nuclear Cooperation, maintaining its leadership role in strengthening global nuclear security.", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Joint Statement by President Obama and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan on Nuclear Security Cooperation"}

We, the leaders, gathered in Washington, D.C. on the first day of April, 2016 on the occasion of the fourth Nuclear Security Summit, are proud to observe that the Summits have since 2010 raised awareness of this threat and driven many tangible, meaningful and lasting improvements in nuclear security. The Summits have also strengthened the nuclear security architecture at national, regional and global levels, including through broadened ratification and implementation of international legal instruments regarding nuclear security. We underline the importance of the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and its 2005 Amendment and the International Convention on the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and will continue to work toward their universalization and full implementation. We welcome the imminent entry into force of the 2005 Amendment to the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Facilities and encourage further ratifications.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to our shared goals of nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear energy. We also reaffirm that measures to strengthen nuclear security will not hamper the rights of States to develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. We reaffirm the fundamental responsibility of States, in accordance with their respective obligations, to maintain at all times effective security of all nuclear and other radioactive material, including nuclear materials used in nuclear weapons, and nuclear facilities under their control.\nMore work remains to be done to prevent non-state actors from obtaining nuclear and other radioactive materials, which could be used for malicious purposes. We commit to fostering a peaceful and stable international environment by reducing the threat of nuclear terrorism and strengthening nuclear security.\nSustaining security improvements requires constant vigilance at all levels, and we pledge that our countries will continue to make nuclear security an enduring priority. We, as leaders, are conscious of our responsibility. Actions taken today can prevent tomorrow's nuclear security incidents. Where we choose to take such steps visibly, in light of national conditions and while protecting sensitive information, we contribute to strengthening and building confidence in the effectiveness of our national nuclear security regimes.\nCountering nuclear and radiological terrorism demands international cooperation, including sharing of information in accordance with States' national laws and procedures. International cooperation can contribute to a more inclusive, coordinated, sustainable, and robust global nuclear security architecture for the common benefit and security of all.\nWe reaffirm the essential responsibility and the central role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in strengthening the global nuclear security architecture and in developing international guidance, and its leading role in facilitating and coordinating nuclear security activities among international organizations and initiatives and supporting the efforts of States to fulfill their nuclear security responsibilities. We welcome and support the Agency in convening regular high-level international conferences, such as the December 2016 international conference on nuclear security including its Ministerial segment, to maintain political momentum and continue to raise awareness of nuclear security among all stakeholders.\nWe seek to maintain the international network of officials and government experts who have supported the Summit process and to incorporate the broader community of States, as well as encourage the continued engagement of relevant partners in nuclear industry and civil society.\nIn our continued collective determination to ensure political momentum and to continuously strengthen nuclear security at national, regional, and global levels, we resolve to implement the attached Action Plans, in support of the international organizations and initiatives to which we respectively belong (the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, INTERPOL, the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, and the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction), to be carried out on a voluntary basis and consistent with national laws and respective international obligations. These plans reflect the political will of participating States.\nThe 2016 Summit marks the end of the Nuclear Security Summit process in this format. We affirm that the Communiqués from the 2010, 2012 and 2014 Summits and the Work Plan of the 2010 Summit will continue to guide our efforts as we endeavor to fully implement them.", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Joint Statement—Nuclear Security Summit 2016 Communiqué"}

During National Donate Life Month, we lift up the thousands of selfless individuals across America who are living or registered organ donors. And as we honor those who have saved lives in the past by donating organs, we recommit to supporting the researchers, innovators, advocates, and medical professionals working to reduce the number of people awaiting vital organ transplants.\nA rising demand for organs exists without enough organs to meet it, making the urgency for those willing and able to donate even more critical and the need for innovation and support even more imperative. My Administration has striven to support donors and recipients and to expand the availability of organs for transplant. In 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), building on efforts within the transplant community, launched a nationwide kidney exchange program to bring together pairs of kidney donors and recipients in an effort to increase the quality and quantity of kidney transplants. HHS has also made more financial support available to low-income living donors to help cover expenses like travel and lodging costs that are often incurred throughout the donation process. The Affordable Care Act offers greater security to living donors by prohibiting insurers from denying health coverage to someone with a preexisting condition --donating an organ may have previously been considered a preexisting condition and prevented individuals from obtaining the care they deserved after selflessly giving an organ to someone in need. And in 2013, I signed the bipartisan HOPE Act, paving the way for the first transplants in the United States between HIV-positive donors and recipients—and the first of these life-saving transplants took place earlier this year.\nAnyone can indicate their desire to be a donor, regardless of age or medical history, and I encourage all Americans to consult their family members and communicate their choice. More information on donation and opportunities to register can be found by visiting www.OrganDonor.gov.\nThrough Medicare, the Federal Government spends nearly $35 billion each year to care for the more than half a million patients with end-stage kidney failure in the United States. Increasing accessibility to organs can save lives while helping to defray overall healthcare costs. As we work to get more people off of the waiting list and into the operating room for a transplant, we are continuing to invest in researching new and innovative ways to address this critical issue. Over the span of three recent years, we invested nearly $3 billion into regenerative medicine research, and we are making great strides in advancing treatment and improving technological capabilities. Additionally, we have opened new doors of collaboration with businesses, universities, and foundations to progress our prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases. Our Nation has taken bold steps in recent years, and we will continue working to reduce the organ waiting list by building on our efforts to utilize regeneration and other methods for ensuring a balance between the supply and demand of vital organs.\nLast year, the United States exceeded 30,000 annual organ transplants for the first time. Progress has been made and great promise exists, but much work remains to help the more than 120,000 Americans on the organ waiting list. This month, let us remember those we have lost and provide support to all who continue to wait and hope. Across government, industry, academia, private organizations, and the medical and philanthropic communities, we must all do our part to lift up donors, donor families, and patients by supporting efforts to shorten the organ waiting list. Together, we can improve and save lives by celebrating those who give of themselves—whether as living donors or as registered donors—to provide the greatest gift there is to offer.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2016 as National Donate Life Month. I call upon health care professionals, volunteers, educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and private organizations to join forces to boost the number of organ, eye, and tissue donors throughout our Nation.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Proclamation 9415—National Donate Life Month, 2016"}

By supporting health professionals and embracing our obligations to promote public health and protect our planet, we can uphold our shared responsibility to preserve the promise of a happy and healthy life for our children and grandchildren.\nEnsuring all Americans have access to quality, affordable health insurance is imperative for maintaining our public health, and I am proud that 6 years after I signed it, the Affordable Care Act has extended the peace of mind that comes with health coverage to 20 million Americans. First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative is encouraging more physical activity and nutritious food choices for our Nation's youth, engaging parents and kids in the work of building stronger, healthier communities. To spare more American families heartbreak, I have proposed over 1 billion dollars in new funding to address prescription opioid abuse and heroin use, a public health issue that has taken a devastating toll on too many. We are also striving to promote mental health as an essential component of overall health, helping ensure access to mental health care and services and working to prevent suicide. And because public safety is a critical component of addressing public health, I announced new, commonsense steps this year to help address our country's epidemic of gun violence and keep our neighborhoods safe.\nJust as we must sustain a healthy world today, we must do everything in our power to preserve it for those who will inherit it. Climate change has a profound impact on our public health, contributing to intensified smog, an extended allergy season, the spread of diseases into new regions, and greater and more acute incidence of asthma. Last year, the White House hosted a Summit on Climate Change and Health to expand awareness of the real threat a changing climate poses to our health and to focus on vulnerable groups who may face more serious challenges adapting to climate change. No community is immune to this reality, nor can any nation cordon itself off from climate or the air we share. That is why last year, along with nearly 200 countries from around the world, the United States negotiated the Paris Agreement—the most ambitious climate change agreement in history that commits all participating parties to putting forward climate targets of growing stringency to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Adopting this agreement for an international framework builds on domestic actions we have already taken to invest in clean energy, reduce our carbon emissions, and transition to a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future.\nLike the threat of climate change, other public health challenges—like infectious diseases—cannot be addressed by any one nation alone. In an increasingly interconnected world, we face new trials that demand international attention. My Administration is working with our international partners to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We also launched the Global Health Security Agenda, which aims to strengthen all countries' public health systems and stop the spread of disease outbreaks by ensuring nations from around the world have the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats to our health and safety. Already, this cooperation is helping us confront the spread of the Zika virus.\nAmerica is built on the notion that we are our brothers' and our sisters' keepers, and that we all have certain obligations to one another. Never is that idea truer than when ensuring the health of the world our children will live in long after we are gone. This week, let us treat every child as if they are our own by accepting our responsibilities to leave them with a healthier, cleaner planet than we have, and let us continue reaching for a brighter, more secure future for all the world's people.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 4 through April 10, 2016, as National Public Health Week. I call on all citizens, government agencies, private businesses, non-profit organizations, and other groups to join in activities and take action to improve the health of our Nation.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Proclamation 9416—National Public Health Week, 2016"}

On World Autism Awareness Day, we reaffirm our dedication to ensuring that belief is a reality for all those who live on the autism spectrum—including 1 in 68 children. And we uphold our obligation to help make sure every man, woman, and child, regardless of ability or background, is accepted for who they are and able to lead a life free from discrimination and filled with opportunity.\nFrom home to school and in businesses and communities around the world, people living with autism spectrum disorder contribute in immeasurable ways to our society. They remind us each day that every person is born with unique talents and should be treated with respect, play an active role in planning for their futures, and feel empowered to fully participate in and contribute to their communities. When those with autism have access to equal opportunities, we all do better, and that begins with making sure our country lives up to its commitment to ensure all things are possible for all people.\nIndividuals with autism are just as deserving of the peace of mind that comes with having quality, affordable health insurance as anyone else. The Affordable Care Act helps ensure no person is prevented from obtaining health coverage simply because they live with a preexisting condition like autism, and it requires most plans to cover recommended preventive services—including critical screenings that test for autism in children. My Administration is dedicated to ensuring educational opportunities for autistic students are worthy of their extraordinary potential and to providing Americans with autism the chance to earn good jobs and hone their skills and talents. We are working to break down barriers to competitive, integrated employment for people with disabilities, including people with autism. We are also promoting inclusivity for kids with autism in high-quality, early childhood education programs. In 2014, I signed the Autism CARES Act, which supports autism-related research and helps us to better understand the particular challenges faced by students and young adults living on the autism spectrum. And this month marks 3 years since my Administration launched the BRAIN Initiative—a collaborative effort by Federal agencies, philanthropies, universities, foundations, and others in the medical and scientific communities that aims to accelerate our work to solve some of the most intricate mysteries of human brain function and reveal new insights into conditions like autism. In my most recent budget proposal, I was proud to support increased funding for this important initiative.\nAmericans with autism play an important role in our national story, and in their daily lives they embody the belief at the heart of our founding: that in America, with hard work and equal access, all people can realize their aspirations. Today, and every day, let us reach for a future in which no person living on the autism spectrum is limited by anything but the size of their dreams—one in which all people have the opportunity to live a life filled with a sense of identity, purpose, and self-determination. Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2, 2016, as World Autism Awareness Day. I encourage all Americans to learn more about autism and what they can do to support individuals on the autism spectrum and their families, and to help shape a world in which all people, including those with autism, are accepted for who they are.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "Proclamation 9417—World Autism Awareness Day, 2016"}

As at our previous summits, we didn't just come here to talk, but we came here to act. I know that the very technical nature of nuclear security doesn't always make for flashy headlines. But over the past 6 years, we have made significant, meaningful progress in securing the world's nuclear material so that it never falls into the hands of terrorists. And I want to take a few moments to step back and lay out exactly what we have accomplished.\nTogether, we have removed the world's most deadly materials from nuclear facilities around the world. With Japan's announcement today, we've now removed or secured all the highly enriched uranium and plutonium from more than 50 facilities in 30 countries: more than 3.8 tons, which is more than enough to create 150 nuclear weapons. That's material that will never fall into the hands of terrorists.\nFourteen nations and Taiwan—countries as diverse as Argentina and Chile, to Libya and Turkey, to Serbia and Vietnam—have now rid themselves entirely of highly enriched uranium and plutonium. And particularly, I want to point out again that successfully removing all of Ukraine's highly enriched uranium 4 years ago meant that the very difficult situation in Ukraine over the past 2 years was not made even more dangerous by the presence of these materials.\nAs of today, South America—an entire continent—is completely free of these dangerous materials. When Poland completes its removal this year, central Europe will be free of them as well. When Indonesia completes its work this year, so will all of Southeast Asia. In other words, as terrorists and criminal gangs and arms merchants look around for deadly ingredients for a nuclear device, vast regions of the world are now off limits. And that is a remarkable achievement.\nWe've made important progress in the United States as well. In addition to the new steps I announced this morning, we've improved nuclear security and training. We've consolidated nuclear materials at fewer facilities, eliminated some 138 tons of our surplus highly enriched uranium, which would be enough for 5,500 nuclear weapons. Working with Russia, we're on track to eliminate enough Russian highly enriched uranium for about 20,000 nuclear weapons, which we are converting to electricity here in the United States.\nMore specifically, as a result of these summits, every single one of the more than 50 nations represented here have taken concrete steps to enhance security at their nuclear facilities and storage sites. And that includes improved physical security, stronger regulations, abiding by international guidelines, greater transparency, and that includes international peer reviews. Fifteen new centers have been created around the world to promote nuclear security technologies and training, to share best practices. And as part of our work today, we agreed to keep strengthening our nuclear facilities' defenses against cyber attacks.\nWe've bolstered international efforts to disrupt nuclear smuggling. The Proliferation Security Initiative has grown to more than 100 nations, including regular exercises to improve our collective ability to interdict shipments. The United States and 36 partner countries have worked to install radiation detection equipment at more than 300 international border crossings, airports, and ports. And we are developing new mobile detection systems as well. And finally, as I noted this morning, we've strengthened the treaties and international partnerships that are a foundation for so many of our efforts.\nSo again, we have made significant progress. And everyone involved in this work—especially our teams, who have worked tirelessly for years—can take enormous pride in our achievements. Nevertheless, as I said earlier, our work is by no means finished. There's still a great deal of nuclear and radioactive material around the world that needs to be secured. Global stocks of plutonium are growing. Nuclear arsenals are expanding in some countries with more small, tactical nuclear weapons, which could be at greater risk of theft. And as a consequence, one of the central goals of this summit was, how do we build on the work that has been done so that we have an international architecture that can continue the efforts, even though this is the last formal leaders' summit?\nSo even as this is the last of those leader-level summits, today we agreed to maintain a strong architecture, including through the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and INTERPOL, to carry on this work and to provide the resources and technical support that is needed to continue this mission. And we are creating a new nuclear security contact group—senior-level experts from more than 30 of our countries—who will meet regularly to preserve the networks of cooperation we've built, to institutionalize this work, and to keep driving progress for years to come.\nAt our session on ISIL this afternoon, there was widespread agreement that defeating terrorist groups like ISIL requires more information sharing. Everybody understands the urgency in the wake of what's happened in Brussels and Turkey, Pakistan, and so many other countries around the world. As a consequence, our Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, is continuing to engage with intelligence leaders from a number of our European partners on deepening our cooperation. And today I invited all the nations represented at this summit to join a broader discussion among our intelligence and security services on how we can improve information-sharing within and among our nations to prevent all manner of terrorist attacks, especially those that might involve weapons of mass destruction.\nIn closing, I just want to say that preventing nuclear terrorism is one part of the broader agenda that I outlined 7 years ago in Prague: stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and seeking a world without them. In recent days, there's been no shortage of analysis on whether we've achieved our vision, and I'm the first to acknowledge the great deal of work that remains, from negotiating further reductions with Russia to dealing with North Korea's nuclear program.\nAs I indicated in Prague, realizing our vision will not happen quickly, and it perhaps will not happen in my lifetime. But we've begun. The United States and Russian nuclear arsenals are on track to be the lowest that they have been in six decades. I've reduced the number and role of nuclear weapons in our nuclear security strategy. In a historic deal, we've prevented the spread of nuclear weapons to Iran. An international fuel bank is being built to promote civil nuclear cooperation. So I'm extremely proud of our record across the board. And we're going to keep pushing forward wherever we can, as I hope future administrations do, to bring us closer to the day when these nuclear dangers no longer hang over the heads of our children and our grandchildren.\nWith that, let me take a few questions. And I'm going to start with Roberta Rampton of Reuters.\nIran\nQ. Thank you. I want to ask about Iran. And 3 weeks ago, Iran's Supreme Leader complained that his country has not been getting actual business deals since the nuclear agreement. And non-U.S. companies are saying that it's very hard, or sometimes impossible, to do much business with Iran without at some point accessing the U.S. financial system to do U.S. dollar-denominated transactions. So my question is, are you considering allowing such transactions? And if so, is that not a betrayal of your assurances that most U.S. sanctions would stay in place?\nThe President. That's not actually the approach that we're taking. So let me say broadly that so long as Iran is carrying out its end of the bargain, we think it's important for the world community to carry out our end of the bargain.\nThey have, in fact, based on the presentations that were made by the IAEA this morning to the P-5-plus-1, have, in fact, followed the implementation steps that were laid out. And as a consequence, sanctions related to their nuclear program have been brought down. Part of the challenge that they face is that companies haven't been doing business there for a long time and they need to get comfortable with the prospects of this deal holding.\nOne of the things that Secretary Lew and his counterparts within the P-5-plus-1 and elsewhere are going to be doing is providing clarity to businesses about what transactions are, in fact, allowed. And it's going to take time over the next several months for companies and their legal departments to feel confident that, in fact, there may not be risks of liability if they do business with Iran.\nAnd so some of the concerns that Iran has expressed we are going to work with them to address. It is not necessary that we take the approach of them going through dollar-denominated transactions. It is possible for them to work through European financial institutions as well. But there is going to need to be continued clarification provided to businesses in order to—for deal flows to begin.\nNow, what I would say is also important is Iran's own behavior in generating confidence that Iran is a safe place to do business. In a deal like this, my first priority, my first concern was making sure that we got their nuclear program stopped, and material that they already had that would give them a very short breakout capacity, that that was shipped out. That has happened. And I always said that I could not promise that Iran would take advantage of this opportunity and this window to reenter the international community.\nIran, so far, has followed the letter of the agreement. But the spirit of the agreement involves Iran also sending signals to the world community and businesses that it is not going to be engaging in a range of provocative actions that might scare business off. When they launched ballistic missiles with slogans calling for the destruction of Israel, that makes businesses nervous. There is some geopolitical risk that is heightened when they see that taking place. If you see—if Iran continues to ship missiles to Hizballah, that gets businesses nervous. And so part of what I hope happens is we have a responsibility to provide clarity about the rules that govern so that Iran can, in fact, benefit, the Iranian people can benefit from an improved economic situation. But Iran has to understand what every country in the world understands, which is, businesses want to go where they feel safe, where they don't see massive controversy, where they can be confident that transactions are going to operate normally. And that's an adjustment that Iran is going to have to make as well.\nAnd frankly, within Iran, I suspect there are different views. In the same way that there are hardliners here in the United States who, even after we certify that this deal is working, even after our intelligence teams, Israeli intelligence teams, say this has been a game changer, are still opposed to the deal on principle, there are hardliners inside of Iran who don't want to see Iran open itself up to the broader world community and are doing things to potentially undermine the deal.\nAnd so those forces that seek the benefits of the deal not just in narrow terms, but more broadly, we want to make sure that, over time, they're in a position to realize those benefits. Okay?\nDavid Nakamura [Washington Post].\nCounterterrorism Strategy/U.S. Military Drone Strikes\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. As you mentioned at the beginning of your remarks, you just finished a working session with 50 world leaders about combating terrorism and groups like the Islamic State. And I wanted to ask you specifically about one of the strategies—prime strategies—your administration is using in that effort. In the past several weeks, your administration has killed well over 200 people in airstrikes in Somalia, Libya, and Yemen, according to the Department of Defense. How can you be certain that all the people killed posed an imminent threat to the United States? And why is the United States now killing scores of people at a time, rather than eliminating individuals in very targeted strikes? Thank you.\nThe President. We have constructed a fairly rigid and vigorous set of criteria for us evaluating the intelligence that we receive about ISIL, where it might be operating, where Al Qaida is operating. These guidelines involve a whole range of agencies consulting extensively, and are then checked, double checked, triple checked before kinetic actions are taken.\nAnd for the most part, our actions are directed at high-value targets in the countries that you just described, outside of the theater of Iraq and Syria. In some cases, what we're seeing are camps that after long periods of monitoring becomes clear are involved in in directing plots that could do the United States harm or are supporting ISIL activities or Al Qaida activities elsewhere in the world.\nSo, if after a long period of observation, we are seeing that, in fact, explosive materials are being loaded onto trucks and individuals are engaging in training in small arms and there are some of those individuals who are identified as couriers for ISIL or Al Qaida, then, based on those evaluations, a strike will be taken. But what we have been very cautious about is making sure that we are not taking strikes in situations where, for example, we think there is the presence of women or children or if it is in a normally populated area. And recently, we laid out the criteria by which we're making these decisions. We declassified many elements of this. We are going to be putting forward and trying to institutionalize on a regular basis how we make these evaluations and these analyses.\nI think it—in terms of the broader debate that's taken place, David, I think there's been in the past legitimate criticism that the architecture, the legal architecture around the use of drone strikes or other kinetic strikes wasn't as precise as it should have been, and there's no doubt that civilians were killed that shouldn't have been. I think that over the last several years, we have worked very hard to avoid and prevent those kinds of tragedies from taking place.\nIn situations of war, we have to take responsibility when we're not acting appropriately, or where we've just made mistakes even with the best of intentions. And that's what we're going to continue to try to do. And I—what I can say with great confidence is that our operating procedures are as rigorous as they have ever been and that there is a constant evaluation of precisely what we do.\nCarol Lee [Wall Street Journal].\n2016 Presidential Election/U.S. Foreign Policy\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. You've spent 7 years now working on nonproliferation issues, and you said in your opening remarks that you hope that the next—future administrations do the same and make it a priority.\nThe President. Right.\nQ. This week, one of—the Republican frontrunner to replace you said that perhaps North—South Korea and Japan should have nuclear weapons and wouldn't rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe. Did that come up at this summit? And just generally, what message does it send when a major-party candidate is articulating such a reversal in U.S. foreign policy? And also, who did you vote for in the Democratic primary? [Laughter]\nThe President. Well, first of all, it's a secret ballot, isn't it, Carol? Okay. [Laughter] All right, I—no, I'm not going to tell you now. [Laughter]\nWhat do the statements you mentioned tell us? They tell us that the person who made the statements doesn't know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally. [Laughter]\nIt came up on the sidelines. I've said before that people pay attention to American elections. What we do is really important to the rest of the world. And even in those countries that are used to a carnival atmosphere in their own politics want sobriety and clarity when it comes to U.S. elections because they understand the President of the United States needs to know what's going on around the world and has to put in place the kinds of policies that lead not only to our security and prosperity, but will have an impact on everybody else's security and prosperity.\nOur alliance with Japan and the Republic of Korea is one of the foundations, one of the cornerstones of our presence in the Asia-Pacific region. It has underwritten the peace and prosperity of that region. It has been an enormous boon to American commerce and American influence. And it has prevented the possibilities of a nuclear escalation and conflict between countries that, in the past and throughout history, have been engaged in hugely destructive conflicts and controversies.\nSo you don't mess with that. It is an investment that rests on the sacrifices that our men and women made back in World War II when they were fighting throughout the Pacific. It is because of their sacrifices and the wisdom and—that American foreign policy makers showed after World War II that we've been able to avoid catastrophe in those regions. And we don't want somebody in the Oval Office who doesn't recognize how important that is.\nAndrew Beatty [Agence France-Presse].\nTurkey\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday you met with President Erdogan of Turkey hours after some fairly ugly scenes at the Brooking Institution. I was wondering, do you consider him an authoritarian?\nThe President. Turkey is a NATO ally. It is an extraordinarily important partner in our fight against ISIL. It is a country with whom we have a long and strategic relationship with. And President Erdogan is someone who I've dealt with since I came into office, and in a whole range of areas, we've had a productive partnership.\nWhat is also true, and I have expressed this to him directly, so it's no secret that there are some trends within Turkey that I've been troubled with. I am a strong believer in freedom of the press. I'm a strong believer in freedom of religion. I'm a strong believer in rule of law and democracy. And there is no doubt that President Erdogan has repeatedly been elected through a democratic process, but I think the approach that they've been taking towards the press is one that could lead Turkey down a path that would be very troubling.\nAnd we are going to continue to advise them to—and I've said to President Erdogan, remind him that he came into office with a promise of democracy. And Turkey has historically been a country in which deep Islamic faith has lived side by side with modernity and an increasing openness. And that's the legacy that he should pursue, rather than a strategy that involves repression of information and shutting down democratic debate.\nHaving said that, I want to emphasize the degree to which their cooperation has been critical on a whole range of international and regional issues and will continue to be. And so as is true with a lot of our friends and partners, we work with them, we cooperate with them. We are appreciative of their efforts. And there are going to be some differences. And where there are differences, we will say so. And that's what I've tried to do here.\nI'll take one last question. This young lady right there.\nAzerbaijan/Nuclear Security/Transnational Threats\nQ. Thank you, President. Mr. President, what do you think——\nThe President. Where are you from, by the way?\nQ. I am from Azerbaijan. How can Azerbaijan support in nuclear security issue?\nThe President. Well, Azerbaijan, like many countries that participated, have already taken a number of steps. And each country has put forward a national action plan. There are some countries that had stockpiles of highly enriched uranium that they agreed to get rid of. There are other countries that have civilian nuclear facilities, but don't necessarily have the best security practices, and so they have adopted better security practices. There are countries that could potentially be transit points for the smuggling of nuclear materials, and so they've worked with us on border controls and detection. And because of Azerbaijan's location, it's a critical partner in this process.\nI should point out, by the way, that although the focus of these summits has been on securing nuclear materials and making sure they don't fall into the hands of terrorists, the relationships, the information sharing, the stitching together of domestic law enforcement, international law enforcement, intelligence, military agencies, both within countries and between countries—this set of relationships internationally will be useful not just for nuclear material, but it is useful in preventing terrorism generally. It's useful in identifying threats of chemical weapons or biological weapons.\nOne of the clear messages coming out of this summit and our experiences over the last 7 years is an increasing awareness that some of the most important threats that we face are transnational threats. And so we are slowly developing a web of relationships around the world that allow us to match and keep up with the transnational organizations that all too often are involved in terrorist activity, criminal activity, human trafficking, a whole range of issues that can ultimately do our citizens harms. And seeing the strengthening of these institutions, I think, will be one of the most important legacies of this entire process.\nMark Landler [New York Times], since you had your hand up, I'll call on you. One last question.\nNuclear Security/Russia-U.S. Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty/Nuclear Nonproliferation\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask a question about nuclear policy. Through these past 7 years when you've pushed to rid the world of nuclear materials and fissile material, the U.S. nuclear industry has actually worked to improve miniaturization of warheads. And while it has not developed new classes of cruise missiles or warheads, it's worked to improve the technology. And that's prompted some in China and Russia to say, well, gee, we need to keep up. Are you concerned that the technological advances in the United States have had the effect of sort of undermining some of the progress you've made on the prevention side?\nThe President. I think it's a legitimate question, and I am concerned. Here's the balance that we've had to strike. We have a nuclear stockpile that we have to make sure is safe and make sure is reliable.\nAnd after the START Treaty—START II Treaty that we entered into with Russia, we have brought down significantly the number of weapons that are active. But we also have to make sure that they're up to date; that their command-and-control systems that might have been developed a while ago are up to snuff, given all the technology that has changed since that time. And we have to make sure that our deterrence continues to work.\nAnd so even as we've brought down the number of weapons that we have, I have wanted to make sure that what we do retain functions; that it is not subject to a cyber intrusion; that there's sufficient confidence in the system that it— we don't create destabilizing activity.\nMy preference would be to bring down further our nuclear arsenal. And after we completed START II, I approached the Russians—our team approached the Russians in terms of looking at a next phase for arms reductions. Because Mr. Putin came into power, or returned to his office as President, and because of the vision that he's been pursuing of emphasizing military might over development inside of Russia and diversifying the economy, we have not seen the kind of progress that I would have hoped for with Russia.\nThe good news is that the possibilities of progress remain. We are abiding by START II. We're seeing implementation. And although we are not likely to see further reductions during my Presidency, my hope is, is that we have built the mechanisms and systems of verification and so forth that will allow us to continue to reduce them in the future.\nWe do have to guard against, in the interim, ramping up new and more deadly and more effective systems that end up leading to a whole new escalation of the arms race. And in our modernization plan, I've tried to strike the proper balance, making sure that the triad and our systems work properly, that they're effective, but also to make sure that we are leaving the door open to further reductions in the future.\nBut one of the challenges that we're going to have here is that it is very difficult to see huge reductions in our nuclear arsenal unless the United States and Russia, as the two largest possessors of nuclear weapons, are prepared to lead the way. The other area where I think we'd need to see progress is Pakistan and India, that subcontinent, making sure that as they develop military doctrines, that they are not continually moving in the wrong direction.\nAnd we have to take a look at the Korean Peninsula, because the D.P.R.K., North Korea, is in a whole different category and poses the most immediate set of concerns for all of us, one that we are working internationally to focus on. And that's one of the reasons why we had the trilateral meeting with Japan and Korea, and it was a major topic of discussion with President Xi as well. Okay?\nThank you very much, everybody. Have a good weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-04-01", "title": "The President's News Conference"}

They shouldn't start bragging yet.\nAt a televised Republican town hall on Tuesday, it was painful to watch farmers, students and a man whose son died of a drug overdose pose earnest questions to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, who were more interested in attacking each other. Only John Kasich connected with these voters.\nDespite its noble aim and big budget, \"Never Trump\" has become a panicky reaction in search of a strategy. In Wisconsin, \"Never Trump\" means \"How About Cruz?\" as self-interested leaders like Gov.

But for the state's — and the nation's — moderate conservatives, \"Never Trump\" should more logically mean \"Maybe Kasich...\"\n...In some coming states and districts, voter data indicates that Mr. Kasich, not the ultraconservative, evangelical Mr. Cruz, could be more competitive. Yet there's been no real effort by \"Never Trump\" leaders on Mr. Kasich's behalf. Indeed, some Republicans are pressuring the Ohio governor to quit and coalescing around Mr. Cruz, a candidate who was once almost as unthinkable to them as Mr. Trump and should still be.\nThis is happening even though the numbers are there to deprive Mr. Trump of the nomination without delivering it to Mr. Cruz on a platter, says Henry Olsen, of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank in Washington. \"If your goal is ‘Never Trump,' you should put your bets on the best candidate depending on the delegate allocation rules and the demographics of the state,\" he says.\nThis means \"Never Trump\" backers... would work to deliver Delaware, the San Francisco Bay area, the Philadelphia suburbs, and urban areas in New York State to Mr. Kasich...\n...

{"author": "Ted Cruz", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116608", "text": "HOUSTON, Texas - Wisconsin Governor and former Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker today penned the following op-ed in the Wisconsin State Journal in support of Ted Cruz as the candidate who recognizes this race is about restoring jobs, freedom and security for the American people and future generations.\nSee excerpts below and read the full op-ed here.\nWhen I was a kid, I loved history, especially American history. The American founders, especially the signers of the Declaration of Independence, were my \"superheroes\" for building this country. The first time I was in Philadelphia, at a governor's conference in 2011, I snuck off to Independence Hall.\nAs I stood in that room, I realized this: the founders weren't superheroes. They were ordinary people who did something exceptional because they put the service of our country ahead of themselves. And since then, whenever our country has faced a crisis, ordinary men and women have courageously stood up to do extraordinary things.\nThat's why I am proud to endorse Ted Cruz for president. He is leader who recognizes this isn't about him; it's about our country and leaving our kids with a more promising future.\n....\nRight now, our nation is facing steep economic challenges. Wages are stagnant. The number of people who are not in the work force, who aren't even looking for a job, is the highest it's been in decades. Our education system is failing and our kids are falling behind. College debt is crushing students. Health care is more expensive even as wait-times grow and actual doctor-patient care is shrinking. Permanent barriers to economic success are slamming small businesses, farmers, and manufacturing workers.\nBut as Ted often says on the trail, we know how to turn things around, we reignite the Reagan revolution and create more jobs and opportunity. That's what we've done in Wisconsin - and as a result we have seen unemployment drop from 8.1 to 4.6 percent. We've created over 180,000 private sector jobs since 2011 and just a few months ago Wisconsin's employment reached an all-time high, with more people working than at any time in state history.\n....\nTed Cruz will ignite the same kind of growth on a nationwide scale because he recognizes that what has made this country extraordinary is not the government but every one of you - the people across this country who risk everything to build a better life for themselves and their families. And so he'll get the government out of the way. He'll repeal Obamacare and roll back the EPA and the regulatory agents who are stifling your business.\nTed Cruz's tax plan will increase the median household's take-home pay by $7,600, as estimated by the Tax Foundation. It will get rid of the loopholes for special interests, abolish the IRS, and make it so simple to complete your taxes that you can fill them out on a postcard.\nBut it's not just our economy that's at stake; it's our fundamental freedoms - those same freedoms the founders so tirelessly fought to enshrine in our Bill of Rights.  With Ted Cruz, we will have a leader who has spent his life defending our right to free speech and to freely live our faith - and every other right in the Constitution - and who will nominate rock-solid judges who have the same record of faithfully upholding our constitutional freedoms.\nAbroad, ISIS is applauding themselves for their brutal attacks in Paris and Brussels - and they have made it clear their intent is to come after us. Yet our President continues to deny that radical Islamic terrorism is the enemy. Our kids will live in a safer world with Cruz as Commander in Chief because our nation will be stronger. He will rebuild the military and stand with our allies.\nWe need a leader who recognizes that it's not his own exceptionalism but America's that we are working to preserve; who serves the people above all else; and who will make this nation abundantly more prosperous, free, and safe. That's why I am casting my ballot for Ted Cruz, and I ask you to do the same next Tuesday, April 5. If voters unite, just like we've done here in Wisconsin, we can reverse course and restore the principles that have made this nation a land of opportunity.", "timestamp": "2016-04-02", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: Scott Walker: Ted Cruz Will Restore Jobs, Freedom, and Security"}

Polls in Wisconsin and nationwide consistently have shown Sanders defeating Trump by margins much greater than Clinton. \"Not only will we defeat Donald Trump, we will defeat him by a large margin,\" Sanders said. \"The American people will not elect a president of the United States who insults Mexicans and Latinos, who insults Muslims, who insults women and veterans, who insults the African-American community.\"\nWisconsin historically has been a watershed event in the Democratic Party's primary schedule. Since 1960, with only one exception, the winner here has become the party's standard bearer.\nSome pundits have pointed to the state's progressive tradition to explain why Clinton has slipped behind Sanders in recent polls. In fact, however, Wisconsin Democrats frequently have favored establishment candidates. Bill Clinton, John Kerry and Jimmy Carter, for example, all won Wisconsin primaries in contests with more progressive rivals.", "timestamp": "2016-04-02", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Rallies for 'Political Revolution' in Wisconsin"}

This week, I'm speaking to you from our Nuclear Security Summit. I welcomed more than 50 leaders from around the world to make sure we're working together to meet one of the greatest threats to global security: terrorists getting their hands on a weapon of mass destruction, like a nuclear weapon.\nFortunately, because of our efforts so far, no terrorist group has yet succeeded in obtaining a nuclear device or producing a dirty bomb using radioactive materials. But we know that Al Qaida has tried. ISIL has already used chemical weapons in Syria and Iraq. And if they ever got hold of a nuclear weapon or nuclear material, we have no doubt they'd use it.\nThat's why we've been leading a global effort to secure the world's nuclear materials. And with summits like this, we've made important progress. Working with other nations, we have removed or secured enough nuclear material for more than 150 nuclear weapons, material that will now never fall into the hands of terrorists.\nAll of South America is now free of these deadly materials. Central Europe and Southeast Asia are on track to be free of them later this year. That means that as terrorists and criminal gangs look around for the deadly ingredients for a nuclear device, vast regions of the world are now off limits. This is a remarkable achievement. And at this summit, we pledged to keep up our efforts to prevent the world's most deadly networks from obtaining the world's most deadly weapons.\nOur summit was also another opportunity to make sure the world remains united and focused on destroying ISIL. A majority of the nations who came here are part of our global coalition against ISIL. A number of our countries have been targeted by ISIL. Just about all our nations have seen citizens travel to join ISIL in Syria and Iraq.\nIn Syria and Iraq, ISIL continues to lose ground. Our coalition continues to take out its leaders, including those planning terrorist attacks against our countries. They're losing their oil infrastructure and revenues. Their morale is suffering.\nAs ISIL is squeezed in Syria and Iraq, it's lashing out elsewhere, as we've seen most recently—and tragically—from Turkey to Brussels. And during our summit, we focused on ways to step up our efforts to disrupt terrorist attacks. It requires even more cooperation to prevent the flow of foreign terrorist fighters and sharing more information and intelligence. That's why I invited all the nations represented at this summit to join us in a broader discussion among our intelligence and security services on how we can improve information sharing to prevent terrorist attacks.\nThis continues to be a difficult fight. But every day, our dedicated professionals—military, diplomatic, intelligence, counterterrorism, homeland security, law enforcement, and nuclear experts—are working to protect us. Because of the progress we made this week and over recent years, more of the world's nuclear material is secure. It's harder for terrorists to get at it. And as Commander in Chief, I want you to know that we're going to keep doing everything in our power to keep our Nation safe and strong and free.", "timestamp": "2016-04-02", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}
{"author": "John Kasich", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116493", "text": "Barron's Editorial Board\nApril 2, 2016\nIt's time for Republicans to take a closer look at John Kasich.\nFor much of this presidential race, the popular Ohio governor with the common touch and a blue-chip political pedigree has been running at the back of the pack, although to his credit he has outlasted well-funded early favorites such as Florida's Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\nNow, some leaders in the Republican Party are pressing him to drop out of the race, in an effort to boost rival Ted Cruz and block Donald Trump from earning enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot. But having stood down more than a dozen challengers, it is unlikely that Kasich, 63, will stop now.\nFor investors, that looks like a good thing. Kasich's policy prescriptions, experience, and temperament make him the GOP's best bet to reassure a nervous marketplace.\nKasich wins high marks against Hillary Clinton, as well.\n[...]\nAnd in the event of a contested convention, he has a powerful advantage: He's the only GOP candidate who beats Clinton in a head-to-head contest in the polls.\n\"With John Kasich, you have a candidate who lines up almost perfectly with many investors,\" says Chris Krueger, a Washington strategist with Guggenheim Securities. \"He has a track record as a pragmatist from his time as governor, and he knows the markets from his stint as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers.\"\nUnlike Clinton, Kasich has a sensible across-the-board tax-cutting agenda for corporations, individuals, and investors. And as a Republican president working with a presumably GOP-controlled Congress, he would be a more effective leader. After all, he spent six years as the chairman of the House Budget Committee, so he knows how to broker a deal.\n\"It would be marvelous if Kasich were in the White House and Paul Ryan is the speaker of the House,\" says David Kotok, a Kasich fan who is chairman of Cumberland Advisors, a $2.4-billion-in-assets money-management firm in Sarasota, Fla. \"You'd have two people who are bright and skillful compromisers who would get things done, as opposed to the obstructionist politics we've had for many years.\"\nKasich, who spent 18 years in the House, appears to be sincere about reforming entitlements and other government spending. The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has studied the numbers provided by each candidate and concluded that Kasich is the only one in the race who can lower total federal spending as a percentage of gross domestic product over the next decade\n[...]\nA big part of Kasich's appeal in the financial community is his record as a fiscal hawk both in Congress and in the Ohio statehouse. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, he is credited with being a leader in the fight to pass legislation in 1997 setting out guidelines to balance the budget by 2002. No doubt, that effort to eliminate the federal deficit for the first time in three decades was helped by a surging tech-fueled economy, but observers give Kasich his due for his grit and deal-making during the process.\nSince becoming Ohio's governor in 2011, he has helped turn an $8 billion budget shortfall into a surplus through lots of unpopular spending cuts and a highly controversial decision to shift costs from the state to local governments. And he pulled it off while also cutting Ohio's income-tax rate.\nDuring Kasich's governorship, Ohio's unemployment rate fell from 9.2% to 4.9% as of February. And the state has added about 400,000 new jobs. \"Anyone can promise anything for investors,\" says Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols. \"Whose taxes have Ted Cruz or Donald Trump ever cut? Gov. Kasich is the only candidate that can point to a record of accomplishment.\"\n[...]\nTim Pagliara, CEO of CapWealth Advisors, an investment advisory firm in Franklin, Tenn., attended a Kasich gathering last summer and came away impressed. \"If you wanted to brainstorm and come up with the perfect candidate for president, with the right balance of experience and success, Kasich is it,\" he says.\nIn a few months, we'll learn if the Republican Party agrees.\nRead the full editorial here.", "timestamp": "2016-04-03", "title": "Press Release - Barron's Editorial: Kasich is the Best Pick for Markets and the Economy"}

That threw 2,800 Wisconsin workers out of decent-paying jobs at the plant which opened in 1919. The factory was the oldest GM plant in the United States when it was shuttered.\nAs a member of Congress, Sanders was a leader in the fight against the North American Free Trade Agreement. Hillary Clinton supported the bad trade deal that was enacted in 1994. He fought and she backed normalized trade with China and other international trade pacts.\n\"I have voted against and led the opposition to every one of these disastrous trade agreements,\" Sanders told the crowd at a United Automobile Workers union hall named for the mid-century labor leader Walter Reuther. \"Secretary Clinton has supported virtually every one,\" Sanders added.\nOn the campaign trail, Clinton recently has spoken in broad generalities about a recovery of manufacturing in the United States. \"Maybe she should have been there 20 years ago when we started hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs in this country, largely because of disastrous trade deals,\" Sanders said.\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement cost the U.S. 850,000 jobs, including more than 14,000 in Wisconsin. Normalized trade with China cost the U.S. 3.2 million U.S. jobs, including some 68,000 in Wisconsin. Sanders opposed both deals. Clinton supported them.\nI'm not a candidate who goes to the unions, goes to workers and then leaves and goes to a fundraiser with Wall Street. You are my family.

The company moved the plant to Saltillo, Mexico, where workers are paid a fraction of what they make in Kenosha. Eight hundred decent-paying jobs were lost.\nFifteen years ago, Briggs & Stratton was Wisconsin's largest private employer with 11,000 manufacturing workers. Today, it only has 2,500 workers in Wisconsin after it moved plants to Mexico and China.\nMaster Lock and Tower Automotive now employ more workers in Mexico than Wisconsin. And Rockwell Automation has slashed its union workforce in Milwaukee from 6,000 down to just 300 as it moved plants to Mexico, China, and the Dominican Republic.\nSanders consistently has fought job-killing trade deals.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117073", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:07 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Happy Monday, everybody. Hope you all had a pleasant weekend. I do not have anything at the top so we can go straight to your questions.\nJosh, do you want to kick us off here?\nQ: Sure, thanks, Josh. I wanted to start with the two Libyans who were transferred out of Guantanamo Bay, announced today by the Pentagon. With the number of remaining detainees there once again lowered, how much longer does the White House plan to wait to continue to give Congress time to look at your plan before you move ahead with potential executive actions to close the prison?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, let's get to the news first, which is that the Department of Defense did announce the transfer of two Libyan nationals to the Republic of Senegal earlier today. With those transfers, there are now 89 detainees remaining at the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\nLet me also express our gratitude to the Republic of Senegal for this significant humanitarian gesture. The United States appreciates the generous assistance of the government of Senegal as the United States continues its efforts to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\nThis is part of a strategy that the President initiated when he first arrived in the White House. The decision to transfer these two detainees reflects the careful analysis of a review board that was established to consider the individual cases of detainees. The review board's goal was to determine if there are locations to which individuals could be safely transferred under the right circumstances. And Senegal has agreed to put in place appropriate mechanisms that would mitigate the risk that these individuals could pose to U.S. national security down the line.\nSo we're certainly appreciative of the cooperation we've received from Senegal for that effort. And this does enhance our ability to continue to make the case to Congress that we can effectively close the prison at Guantanamo Bay and we can do that entirely consistent with our national security options -- entirely consistent with our national security priorities. And we're going to continue to make that case.\nQ: So even though it's getting farther and farther into the last year of this presidency, the current plan is to continue sticking with expecting that Congress at some point may reverse course and allow you to close the prison?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, this refrain may sound familiar to you, but, yes, the administration is going to continue to do our job, and Congress should do their job in fulfilling their responsibilities to look out for the national security interests of the American people. We certainly have applied that label when it comes to the Supreme Court, but it also applies to a range of national security considerations as well.\nAnd it's not just this President that has made the case that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay would clearly be in our national security interests. This is a case that has been supported by national security experts in both parties, including President George W. Bush and a whole range of officials who served in his administration. This is also a strategy that is strongly supported by the Secretary of Defense.\nSo our national security interests here are clear. And we would welcome Congress stopping their efforts to obstruct the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay and actually work effectively with the administration to get that done.\nQ: I wanted to see if you had any information about the release of some private documents from this bank in Panama or any Sumatra accounts that people had. The Kremlin has said that President Putin was the main target of that breach. Do you have reason to believe that's the case? Any other information about what might have been behind this whole document dump?\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously, we've seen the extensive reporting that's been done on these leaked documents. I don't have a comment on the specific allegations that are included in those documents, but I can tell you that the United States continues to be a leading advocate for increased transparency in the international financial system, and in working against illicit financial transactions and in fighting corruption.\nThere's been a lot of talk over the course of the last year or so about how effective U.S. sanctions that are imposed by the Treasury Department can be effective in advancing the national security interest of the United States. That's true if we are isolating the Russians because of their violation of the territorial integrity of the sovereign nation of Ukraine, or increasing isolating and pressuring the North Korean regime to give up their pursuit of nuclear weapons, or in targeting ISIL's financial operations.\nSo that's why the United States is a leading advocate of greater transparency in these kinds of international financial transactions. Greater transparency allows us to root out corruption and to fight efforts to get around U.S. sanctions that have been put in place.\nSo we're going to continue to be a leading advocate for that kind of transparency. And there will continue to be large groups of national security professionals at the Department of Justice and at the Department of Treasury who will continue to be focused on these issues.\nQ: And in North Carolina, we've seen some major companies -- Pepsi -- and even the state of New York say that they're going to try and limit the kind of travel they're doing to that state, essentially boycotting the state over this law that they've enacted regarding transgender people. Is there any consideration about doing that as far as the federal government not having federal employees travel there when they can avoid it to try and not promote what the state has done there?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of a policy decision like that that's been reached. But there are some both policy and legal questions that are raised by the passage of this law, and there are a number of government agencies that are thinking through those questions now and taking a look at what impact it may have on existing law.\nI can just say that, more generally, this administration is committed to defending and even promoting the equal rights of all Americans, including LGBT Americans. And our commitment to that principle, that people shouldn't be discriminated against just because of who they love, is one that's worth fighting for. And this administration and this President will continue to speak out in support of those equal rights, because that's part and parcel of what it means to live in the greatest country in the world.\nQ: Can you be any more specific about what some of those things that you may be considering, or effects from that, that people are taking into account?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not able to be from here, but there are a range of individual agencies that are taking a look at this. So obviously you can ask them if they've reached any determinations about how this particular law would have an impact on their interactions with the state of North Carolina.\nI will just say that it's not surprising to me that there are a number of significant business entities that have come out to express their concerns about this law. Obviously, the state of North Carolina has an economy that has benefitted significantly from what officials in that state proudly describe as a hospitable business environment. Passage of laws like this do not create a hospitable business environment, particularly if businesses are concerned that either their employees or their customers are not going to be treated fairly by the state, or are going to be singled out by the state. And I'm not surprised to hear that government officials in North Carolina are feeling some pressure on this right now.\nRoberta.\nQ: Back to Gitmo for a second. The Democratic governor of Colorado has said that he opposes housing former Guantanamo detainees in his state, and I'm wondering whether the White House has talked to the governor about this and how his opposition might affect the President's pledge to close the facility.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any specific White House conversations to tell you about, but obviously what the White House would be committed to is ensuring that we work effectively with state and local officials in implementing a strategy successfully.\nBut to talk about any individual state is to get ahead of the game. Because right now, Congress is focused on preventing the transfer of those detainees to any state in the United States. Now, of course, Congress's position is rather ironic because there are already dozens of convicted terrorists that are currently serving prison time in the United States, on U.S. soil, in U.S. prisons. And the administration has forcefully made the case that the ability of our criminal justice system to prosecute those individuals and hold them accountable for their crimes in a way that's consistent with our values actually does enhance our national security. What also enhances our national security is detaining those individuals in prisons where they can not pose a future threat to U.S. national security.\nSo we've found a mechanism for handling these kinds of cases responsibly. That's why the case that is made by members of Congress is, frankly, inconsistent with available evidence. And particularly when we know that continuing to detain these individuals at the prison at Guantanamo Bay is inconsistent with our values and does give extremist organizations the kind of propaganda victory and recruiting tool that they've already used effectively. And why we would continue to provide that to them makes no sense to me.\nQ: So no specific comment on what the governor of Colorado has said? At this stage, anyway?\nMR. EARNEST: Correct.\nQ: Okay. And on Afghanistan, the topic that came up this morning in the President's meeting -- General John Nicholson said today that the U.S. and NATO are behind schedule in training because of the intense combat and fighting that has been happening there. And I'm wondering if you can speak about how that's going to affect President Obama's decision on when and how to further draw down troops there.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that obviously we welcome the valuable contribution that NATO has made to our efforts in Afghanistan. Much of the progress that we have made in Afghanistan would not have been possible without the significant contributions that NATO has made to that effort. And it is that effective partnership that allowed the United States to succeed in decimating core al Qaeda that previously operated with virtual impunity in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.\nAnd we've made enormous progress in helping the Afghan government begin to assume much more control for the security situation in their own country. And that ultimately is the key to our success. And that's been a long road, and we've got a substantial journey ahead of us before we can see the kind of resolution in Afghanistan that we would like to see. But there's no denying that we've made important progress. And the United States and our military personnel in Afghanistan are going to continue to focus on their two missions, which are counterterrorism and training Afghan security forces.\nNATO obviously plays an important role in supporting those missions, particularly the second one. And we have seen improved performance by the Afghan security forces on the battlefield, and they've been tested -- there's no denying that. And we're going to continue to stand with them as they counter the threat from extremists inside their borders.\nMike.\nQ: Thanks. Two questions. To go back to Josh's question on the North Carolina law -- pointing to the agencies, and the agencies might have the details, but I guess my question would be, is the administration comfortable that whatever the agencies decide the White House is willing to accept, even if that decision would lead, for example, to shut off all federal funding for schools in North Carolina, or all federal funding for housing, or all federal funding for transportation? I mean, if that would be what the agencies would decide, does the White House say, yeah, go ahead and do that? Or do you guys have a position on how far you're willing to go in this? And then, second, do you have any thoughts on the court's ruling today on one person, one vote?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, on a decision that agencies have to make, I'm not aware that any of the agencies are considering going quite that far. I'm not sure that the law would allow it, let alone the broader policy implications of making a decision that's that far-reaching. But, ultimately, individual agency officials will take a close look at what impact this particular law would have on the legal and policy questions that are raised.\nQ: -- would eventually weigh in on before action were taken, whatever that action would be?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly -- obviously the White House is in regular communication with these individual agencies, but right now, the work that's being done is at the agency level, and I certainly wouldn't rule out that the White House at some point would need to be involved in that effort. But right now, it's the agency officials who are taking a close look at this.\nYour second question was on the Supreme Court ruling today. Obviously, I think you've seen from the Department of Justice that they were pleased with the ruling. Many of the arguments that were effectively made by the Solicitor General before the Court were incorporated into the decision that the justices reached. It certainly is consistent with -- generally speaking, it's consistent with the arguments that the government has made about the most fair and effective way for American citizens to elect their representatives in government at all levels.\nMary.\nQ: Back to the so-called Panama Papers. Several close U.S. allies are also implicated, including the President of Argentina, who President Obama visited just two weeks ago; the Saudi King, who the President is going to meet with in two weeks. How concerned is the President that several allies seem to be shielding their money in this way? And does he plan to address it with them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I understand that President Macri, for example, has already addressed this. I'm not going to be able to consider the individual claims that are made based on some information included in the documents. Based on some of the reports that I've seen, there are some 11 million documents that have been released, so my guess is it's going to take even the most astute experts a little while to analyze all the information that's included in there.\nBut, look, this large volume of documents does not change the U.S. position, which is that there should be greater transparency in international financial transactions and there are a whole host of reasons for that, many of them are consistent with our national security interests. And we continue to advocate for that kind of transparency on an international scale. I can tell you that even in spite of some of the lack of transparency that exists in many of these transactions, there are determined experts at both the Department of Treasury and the Department of Justice who can examine these transactions -- or who are regularly examining transactions in the international markets to determine their consistency with sanctions that the United States has imposed or even laws that are on the books here in the United States.\nQ: And on the Supreme Court and the President's nominee, despite the White House's campaign efforts by Senate Democrats, there doesn't seem to have been much of any shift in Republicans' desire to hold any kind of confirmation hearing or a vote. Why do you think that is? And is Mitch McConnell outmaneuvering you on this one?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you'll recall that just in the hours after Justice Scalia's untimely death, Leader McConnell was quite clear that the President should not nominate a successor to fill that vacancy on the Supreme Court. That, of course, is in conflict with the constitutional obligations, both of the President and of the United States Congress. And we've seen some visible discomfort on the part of Republican senators trying to defend that position. That's why we've seen such a large number of Republican senators come forward and indicate that they are, in fact, prepared to meet with the President's nominee.\nTomorrow, the President's nominee will meet with two Republican senators -- both Senator Collins of Maine and Senator Boozman from Arkansas. And even over the weekend, Senator Cornyn, who is an enthusiastic supporter of Leader McConnell's position on this, has acknowledged that there is a slippery slope. He explained that that's why they're trying to draw a hard line here in refusing to, in any way, consider the President's nominee. His view is -- those were his words, it's a slippery slope toward the confirmation of what he described as an \"Obama judge.\"\nAnd so that's why we feel like we have made some important progress here. I think that progress is evident from some of the public opinion polls that your news organizations have conducted, indicating that it's not just Democrats who oppose the strategy that Republicans have pursued here -- it's even Republican voters who are uncomfortable with the position that is taken by Republican leaders on this matter.\nEven Republican voters believe that members of the United States Senate should do their job, and it is evident right now that many Republican senators are refusing to do so. They're refusing to do the job that they were elected to do, and they're not doing it because of some crisis of conscience -- they're doing it because they're following the orders of the Republican Leader in Washington, D.C. That's not really a recipe for success, because the last time I checked -- and, again, I'm no political expert here -- but the last time I checked, the public's view of the Republican leadership in Washington, D.C. is not particularly high. It is not particularly favorable, even among Republicans.\nAnd I think that is what is hard for Republicans in the Senate to justify to their constituents. And I think that's why even as Chairman Grassley was doing town hall meetings in the most conservative part of his state, that he even faced some tough, pressing questions about this. He described resenting the suggestion that somehow he wasn't doing his job. We heard Senator Moran in Kansas, who has taken a couple of different positions on this issue, indicate that he doesn't like being accused by his constituents of not doing his job. He'd prefer to just take a vote. I suspect that that position of refusing to take a vote is even more difficult to defend when the only reason you're refusing to take that vote is because you're taking orders from the Republican Leader in the United States Senate.\nSo that's why I feel like we've made some progress in at least putting some pressure on Republicans. And we're starting to see some Republicans acknowledge -- you see some Republicans who have actually come out and say that there should be a vote. Senator Kirk put it rather colorfully himself in suggesting that his colleagues should \"man up\" and vote. He's right. And to her credit, even one of his colleagues in the Republican Party in the United States Senate who is not a man suggested that they should step up to the plate and vote. So we are seeing some progress to be made here, and we're hopeful that Republicans will continue to venture down the slippery slope that Senator Cornyn described.\nQ: So you're still optimistic that these meetings and these conversations that are happening will still ultimately lead them to change their minds and hold an actual hearing or vote? Because so far we're just hearing about conversations, not really -- you're not seeing that sea change that you would need to get that --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there has been a sea change when it comes to actual meetings; that there was an expression on the part of the Republican leadership in Washington that their members weren't going to have meetings with the President's nominee, but yet we've seen 17 different members of the -- Republican members of the United States Senate indicate a willingness to do that. And Senator Kirk met with Chief Judge Garland last week, and there will be a couple more that Chief Judge Garland will meet with tomorrow, both Senators Boozman and Collins.\nAnd again, I think the reason that this is complicated for Republicans is not just based on their constitutional responsibility. This would be a difficult position for Republicans to defend no matter who the President had nominated to the Supreme Court. But the fact that the President has nominated an individual of unquestioned legal credentials, somebody who has more experiences on the federal judicial bench than any other nominee in the history of the Supreme Court, and the fact that the President nominated somebody who even a leading Republican has described as a consensus nominee makes their position even harder to defend than it otherwise would be.\nAnd again, the fact that the only explanation that they can come up with is this is what the Republican leadership in Washington, D.C. wants me to do, that's a pretty tough position to defend.\nJustin.\nQ: I wanted to look back first on the NATO meeting this morning. I'm wondering the extent to which Donald Trump's comments last week about NATO either inspired the meeting or it came up during the meeting between the two leaders.\nMR. EARNEST: The meeting with the NATO Secretary General was actually organized shortly after the first of the year. So this is something that's been on the books long before Mr. Trump's ill-advised comments about the importance of the U.S.-NATO relationship.\nI did not get a detailed readout of the meeting. I would be very surprised if there was any extensive conversation that involved Mr. Trump in the meeting.\nQ: I wanted to run down a couple other things that came out of the Panama Papers. The disclosures did show ties to more than 30 people that have been sanctions by the U.S., whether Mexican drug cartels, North Korea, sort of all the things that you mentioned. So I'm wondering -- I know that you said that we've got kind of dedicated people working on this, but do these revelations prompt new questions about the effectiveness of our sanctions regime? And is there something that the Treasury Department will be doing after these revelations to sort of change their enforcement of their sanctions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's too early to tell whether or not a change in the implementation of these sanctions is warranted. I think the available evidence indicates to us that the efforts that are put in place by the Treasury Department to impose sanctions to combat terrorist financing are effective. We've seen, since the imposition of international sanctions against Russia, for example, based on their violation of the sovereignty of Ukraine, the Russian economy has weakened significantly since then. There are a host of factors that have contributed to that, but part of that has been the effective implementation of sanctions.\nGoing back to the agreement with Iran, the United States organized the international community to impose sanctions against Iran. That is what compelled Iran to the negotiating table and eventually compelled Iran to agree with the rest of the international community not to obtain a nuclear weapon.\nSo I think we've already seen the effectiveness of our sanctions at work. And we're continually looking for ways to ensure that the implementation of those sanctions is more effective. That is why we continue to advocate for more transparency, for greater transparency in the international financial system. It's not at all a surprise to anybody in the administration -- I don't think it's a surprise to you -- that there are people who are looking for illicit ways to get around U.S. sanctions. And to the extent that there is any evidence that they are doing that, I think it would only be common sense that we might learn from steps that they have taken to ensure that our sanctions could have the maximum impact.\nQ: They also included details about Ukrainian President Poroshenko, especially that he had created a shell company in the middle of the turmoil in 2014. A big part of your guys' effort in Ukraine and especially tying aid to Ukraine is rooting out corruption there. And so I'm wondering if anything in there has at all sort of led the U.S. to reevaluate its support for President Poroshenko or heightened concerns about corruption.\nMR. EARNEST: No, and for a couple of reasons. The first is that, again, I can't comment on any of the specific allegations that have been raised by these documents. Given the large volume of documents that are included in here, I think it's hard to jump to any conclusions right away.\nBut what's also true is that President Poroshenko has demonstrated a commitment, along with the rest of the government of Ukraine, to implementing a whole bunch of anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine. And all along, the United States has continue to encourage President Poroshenko and other senior officials in the Ukrainian government to follow through with implementing those anti-corruption reforms.\nThere is more work that needs to be done. But when you consider the record of President Poroshenko's predecessor, it's clear that they've made some important progress. And what's clear also is that the successful implementation of those anti-corruption reforms will be critical to the long-term success of the nation of Ukraine. And as the United States continues to support Ukraine in offering some security assistance, but also in terms of providing economic assistance, we're also going to continue to encourage them to implement those reforms faithfully to ensure the long-term success of our partner.\nQ: There's been some calls for leaders around the world for kind of an international effort to address some of these flaws in the international banking system. I'm wondering if that's something the U.S. would do on the lead, and if there are any plans to use this as kind of a springboard for maybe things that the U.S. has been advocating for for a long time, or new ideas that have come up kind of based on the revelations here.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not aware of any specific change in our policy, or any -- the creation of a new body as a result of these documents. But look, they've only been public for 24 hours or so now.\nBut whether or not these documents reveal substantive, legitimate evidence of people thwarting monitors of the international financial system, the United States will continue to be a leading advocate of greater transparency in our financial system. And that's something that we have long pursued, and we're going to continue to be at the forefront of making that argument because it contributes to our national security. And there are officials both at the Treasury Department and the Department of Justice who have responsibilities here. The effective completion, or the effective implementation of those strategies by the Department of Treasury and the Department of Justice also rely on effective coordination with our partners around the world.\nSo there obviously is an opportunity for the United States to use some of our leverage as a leader in this field and as the world's largest economy to bring about some of the changes that we would like to see. And again, we've been doing that for a long time. And those efforts will only -- are only going to continue.\nRon.\nQ: On the North Carolina front, you said that the White House is not involved at this point in the agency review that's going on. What is the President's level of interest and engagement? You've said some very strong things about the law from the podium. I'm surprised that you're essentially distancing or creating some separation between the White House and this issue of funding or other measures taken against the North Carolina because of the law.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't mean to leave you with the perception that we're creating some distance, I just mean to leave you with the perception that this is the functional responsibility of individual agencies to determine whether or not this state-passed law has any impact on any rules or regulations that are on the books that would have an impact on agency funding or other agency policy decisions.\nSo the agencies will consider that. They'll make that evaluation and they'll take a look at the law, they'll take a look at policy. And if we reach the point where a process needs to be led by the White House to make that kind of decision, then we'll do that. We won't hesitate to do that. But right now, this is a process that individual agencies are undertaking.\nQ: Would you anticipate that that might happen, you might get to that point, given what we know about the law already? You called it mean-spirited, or something like that. Given how outspoken the President has been on civil rights and gay and LGBT rights, I'm -- again, would you expect that this might be something -- principle that you'd really try to push hard?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think as a matter of principle, ensuring that individual Americans are not discriminated against because of who they love is something that the President feels strongly about, and the President will be forceful in making the case that he is going to stand on the side of fairness and justice and equality. And he's done that throughout his seven years in office, he did that before he was elected President, and I'm confident he'll do that in the time that remains.\nAs it relates to this specific law, though, and its impact on government policies, I think a lot of that is going to be determined by what agencies find. It may be that agencies find that there's not much that can be done. But again, it's the agencies that will lead that effort. And I'm confident that once they reach the point of announcing any decisions, that they'll be in touch with the White House about that.\nQ: On ISIS, at the Nuclear Summit the other day and that session, the President said -- emphasized that he had 50 world leaders, many of them are part of the coalition. He had the NATO Secretary General here today. I'm curious about what specific asks there were, if any, by the President of this group to try and -- I think he did use the words -- of his analysis, \"urgency,\" because of what happened in Brussels and because of the -- I'm trying to determine what actually happened or what was said or what was requested that reflects some sense of urgency that may make the strategy or the response different now, more robust. Or are we expected to see things as they've been?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, the President is definitely committed to making sure that we continue to ramp up our efforts against ISIL. And we have been on this upward trajectory for quite some time now, and I think there are a variety of ways to evaluate that.\nOne way to evaluate that is the important progress that we've made in retaking territory that ISIL had previously controlled. We've now retaken about 40 percent of the territory that ISIL previously controlled in Iraq. The percentage is smaller in Syria, but some of the strategic locations that have been recovered from ISIL are having an impact on ISIL's ability to operate in that country and in coordination with their cells, not just in Iraq but in some other locations too. All of that is valuable.\nWe've also seen us escalate our campaign in terms of the efforts against ISIL's leadership in Syria. And I know that the Department of Defense over the weekend announced a couple of dozen strikes that were taken just over the weekend by the United States and coalition fighters against ISIL targets inside of Syria.\nSo we maintain a pretty rapid pace here. And that's evidence of the priority that the President has placed on the effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. I think the value of the meeting was to ensure that all of the leaders who are involved in this effort understands why this is a priority for the President of the United States. It was an opportunity to review the important progress that our coalition has made, and it was an opportunity to spend at least a little time discussing what are the priority areas that require the attention of our Counter-ISIL Coalition to further degrade and destroy ISIL.\nQ: What are those areas? That's what I'm trying to get at -- what specifically --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a detailed readout of the meeting, but what I can tell you is that the President made clear that when people like Secretary Carter or when Ambassador Brett McGurk come calling to these individual nations and are visiting with their counterparts about important contributions that they can make to our Counter-ISIL Coalition, the President made clear that when those individuals are making a request to those countries, that they're making a request on behalf of the President of the United States, and that it should be prioritized accordingly.\nAnd we are hopeful that that will continue to allow us to leverage the contributions of a wide variety of members to our coalition to continue to ramp up our activities against ISIL. And whether that's our military contribution or whether that is a contribution to our counter-financing efforts, or even a contribution to our efforts to counter ISIL's online radicalization efforts, there are a variety of ways that people can contribute. And we're hopeful that we'll see a steady increase in the contributions that are being made.\nQ: What about specifically NATO? Because as the Secretary General explained, NATO is not a part of the coalition except that many members are part of the coalition. But inasmuch as there was an attack in Brussels, down the street, figuratively, from NATO headquarters, can we expect NATO to play a more -- again, the word \"robust\" role in that particular mission against ISIS?\nMR. EARNEST: I think you'd have to ask Secretary General Stoltenberg about that. But I can tell you that we value the contributions that we've received from the large number of NATO members who are part of our Counter-ISIL Coalition. And it underscores why NATO is an important body.\nEach of the individual countries who is a part of the NATO alliance makes substantial contributions to their defense and security apparatus because of important NATO obligations that they have. And ensuring that our partners and allies have properly invested in that security infrastructure is one way that we can ensure that we've got partners around the world that can help us when we need it.\nAnd so that's how they can ensure that they're equipped to assist the United States and our Counter-ISIL Coalition partners because they have those resources, because they've maintained that long-term commitment to a robust defense capability. And we certainly welcome that.\nQ: And is the President satisfied with where those spending levels are now? I think the Secretary General made the point of 2015 being the first year that the collective figure did not decrease.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the case that we have made strongly to individual NATO members is that in order to fulfill their NATO obligations, they should devote 2 percent of their GDP to their defense capabilities. And there are some NATO countries that meet that and some that don't. And we're going to continue to make the case that that kind of investment on the front end is critical to the national security of every member of the alliance.\nQ: Did the President --\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't get a detailed readout of the meeting, but if it did, I'm confident, again, that that was not the focus of the conversations.\nQ: And you said that the Trump comments weren't -- didn't come up, or the look on your face --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think my point is that they had a lot of really important things to discuss, and I'm not sure that Mr. Trump's comments would fall in that category.\nMike. Nice to see you.\nQ: Thank you, nice to see you. Was there any effort to reassure the Secretary General following Mr. Trump's comments in recent days?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure that it was necessary, quite frankly. President Obama has spoken at length about how important the U.S.-NATO relationship is. Mike, you may even recall -- you may have been covering the White House full-time at this point -- back in 2011 when the President traveled -- made a state visit to London, and he gave a speech to the members of the British Parliament about the importance of the -- not just the U.S.-U.K. alliance, but the importance of NATO as a building block in United States national security posture.\nAnd that alliance is something that President Obama has long acknowledged is critical to our national security. And it has benefitted from our investment in making sure that alliance remains strong. And the President will certainly be interested in advocating for the election of a successor who believes in the importance of maintaining a strong relationship with NATO.\nQ: With terrorism hitting NATO countries, is there an effort to reformat or refocus the alliance to focus on terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Mike, there are a variety of ways in which NATO-member countries are very focused on terrorism. And whether it's fighting extremists in Afghanistan, which NATO has been doing side by side with the United States for more than a decade, or individual countries who are fighting extremism within their borders and benefitting from the support and cooperation of NATO allies -- for example, the United States has been strong in offering our support to both the French and the Belgians in countering some of the extremism that they've seen inside their countries. And so given the national security concerns of many of the members of NATO, it's clear that the need to fight terrorism is a priority of NATO member countries.\nQ: The Navy says in recent days it stopped an Iranian vessel loaded with weapons, likely heading for Yemen --\n1,500 AK-47s, 200 RPG launchers, 21 .50-caliber machine guns. Is that an example of the Iranians following the letter of the agreement but not necessarily the spirit of it? Or is that a violation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think one thing that this illustrates is the commitment on the part of the United States to countering Iran's destabilizing activities in the region. We obviously work with a whole host of other countries in that effort, and one of the things that President Obama will discuss at the GCC Summit in Saudi Arabia next month -- or I guess it's later this month now\n-- will be ramping up our efforts to counter Iran's destabilizing activities in the region. And one example of their destabilizing activities is their ongoing materiel support for Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nWhat I can tell you is that we obviously are concerned about this development because offering up support to the rebels in Yemen is something that is not at all consistent with U.N. Security Council resolutions. And I'm confident that the United States and our other partners on the Security Council will take a close look at this incident, consider the available evidence, and if and when it's appropriate, raise this for other members of the Security Council.\nQ: Would the United States like to see some kind of consequences for this kind of destabilizing behavior?\nMR. EARNEST: I think at this point, it's too early to say exactly what we would suggest, but, again, I think this is a clear illustration that the United States is quite serious about working with other countries in the region to counter Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, on Guantanamo. You used the phrase, \"significant humanitarian gesture\" by Senegal. That's not language you normally hear from the administration. What's so different about these two detainees versus the ones taken in by Estonia or all the other countries that have taken in released detainees?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have the details about these individuals -- about these individual detainees. I'm sure the Department of Defense could provide you with some additional information about them. But we certainly have welcomed the willingness on the part of other countries to take in Gitmo detainees. And in some cases, we have described it as a humanitarian gesture. So I didn't use that language to send a signal that the case of these two individuals was a clear outlier, but rather to demonstrate our appreciation to the Republic of Senegal for agreeing to this step.\nQ: -- not just DOD, but State Department used that phrase, you used that phrase here. And so I'm just wondering if, given where we are in the calendar, if there is something more to the gratitude you're expressing here. Is this because it is crunch time that we do really need these other countries to step up and take in prisoners if you're going to stick to your schedule of closing the place down by January?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly are going to be very focused in our diplomatic efforts to work with countries around the world to settle upon security requirements that could be put in place that would mitigate the risk that transferred Gitmo detainees would pose to the United States. And I certainly wouldn't rule that out.\nI think the other thing that I wanted to acknowledge today is the fact that this is actually -- these are the first two Gitmo detainees that Senegal has agreed to take. And so obviously they've made an important policy decision that benefits the United States and it seemed appropriate in this setting to express our gratitude.\nQ: Can we expect then more transfers in the month to come, given where we are on the calendar and that it is crunch time?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific -- well, let me just say it this way. I don't have any transfers to tell you about right now, but obviously there is a process that the Department of Defense and the State Department have been following to reduce the population at the prison at Guantanamo Bay. And before they can make a transfer like this, the Secretary of Defense has to personally certify that appropriate steps have been taken to mitigate the risk that these individuals would pose to the United States. So that is why we make a strong case that these transfers are clearly consistent with enhancing the national security of the United States.\nQ: But since the White House put forward that plan to shut down Guantanamo Bay, have you seen anything to signal that this is anything other than dead on arrival, and that you'll be entirely dependent on transfers like these?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I will say is that we have been disappointed by the reaction of many Republicans to this plan. We saw people like Senator Roberts from Kansas -- it's unclear if he even read the document before he took a selfie of himself crumbling it and throwing it into the trashcan. I think that is an indication that Republicans don't take this very seriously. And I think it is an indication, as I mentioned to Josh, that Republicans, in particular, are not willing to do their job when it comes to the national security of the United States. And they'll have to answer to the voters for that, and they'll have to make their case to the voters about why, again, taking a selfie of yourself crumbling a piece of paper and throwing it in a trashcan is consistent with serious consideration of an important national security priority.\nBut this administration is going to take seriously our responsibility to protect the American people, and that means working assiduously within the law to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, primarily because it's a waste of money to continue to operate it in the method that is -- in the manner in which it's currently operated. We could save hundreds of millions of dollars over the long term by closing the prison, transferring those that can be safely transferred, and housing the remaining detainees in a facility here in the United States. That also would remove an important recruiting tool that we know that extremist organizations have used to radicalize people around the world.\nSo I recognize the politics of this are a little complicated, but by presenting basic facts -- particularly the fact that there are dozens of convicted terrorists that are currently being detained on American soil and housed in American prisons -- I think this is where you would expect people who are genuinely concerned about protecting the United States willing to work cooperatively with the administration to advance that goal.\nQ: Question for you on refugee policy, broadly. Europe began forcing migrants out of European territory back onto Turkish shores or other points. What is the White House view on this? Do you it view it as somewhat similar to the forced deportations that the U.S. has undertook along its border?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just start by saying that the United States shares the desire to protect people fleeing a desperate situation in Syria or other places across the Aegean Sea. We also are committed to supporting the effort to crack down on the deadly smugglers who prey upon these desperate individuals. Far too many innocent lives have been lost merely to line the pockets of criminal syndicates. And it's deplorable, and it's why the United States has been strongly supportive of the E.U.'s efforts along with Turkey to try to confront this situation. And we commend the commitment from the E.U., its member states, and Turkey, who have demonstrated that they are seeking a comprehensive and coordinated response to the current influx of migrants and refugees from Syria and other nations.\nWe've seen both the E.U. and Turkey commit to making sure that the individuals -- these migrants, or these refugees are being given access to due process to make sure that their international rights are not just respected but actually protected. And that obviously is an important priority of the United States.\nWhat's also an important priority is making sure that we can find an orderly way to meet the basic humanitarian needs of these individuals. And we're talking about, in some cases, families who have fled their homes, just trying to escape violence or, in some cases, to escape genocide. And that's why the United States has stepped forward and offered more than $5 billion in humanitarian assistance to try to meet the needs of these individuals. The United States is actually the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance. In some cases, that means offering direct humanitarian assistance to those who have been displaced internally inside of Syria. In other cases, that actually means providing assistance to other countries like Turkey that are bearing a significant burden by housing a significant number of Syrian migrants. And the United States is serious about continuing to offer that kind of support and that will continue.\nQ: Did this come up in the meeting with the NATO Secretary General? And is it similar to the U.S.'s own deportation of migrants?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not this came up with the NATO Secretary General in the President's meeting with him today. I think it is difficult to compare these two situations -- both the situation of the refugees fleeing violence in Syria and the situation that we've seen with some Central American countries. I think the one thing that they do have in common is a commitment on the part of the United States to the basic protection of the human rights of individuals who are fleeing violence in their home countries. And certainly in the United States, we've made access to due process a critical component of this process. And we have been gratified to see the E.U. and Turkey prioritize those rights as well.\nMichelle.\nQ: So despite how these Panama Papers got out there and the fact that this is private information and -- I mean, some of it is not illegal activity likely. I mean, there's 11 million pages there. Does the White House think that this is a positive thing that it was leaked?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think at this point it's hard to assess whether or not that's an entirely positive thing. I think what's still unclear is exactly how these documents became public. And I know that even that is something that continues to be under investigation. So I think that's going to prevent me from reaching a hard and fast assessment about that right now.\nQ: But you used the leak as a way to state that the U.S. has been a leading advocate for transparency. But this transparency, obviously, the reason it's out there is because of some leak that wasn't intended.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't want to speculate about why it may be out there. It also may be out there because somebody stole the documents and gave them to a reporter.\nQ: Exactly. It's a leak.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think stealing documents and giving them to a reporter is different than sharing information with a reporter that might not otherwise be public. I'm not an attorney, but I do think that there is a difference there.\nQ: I mean, it is private information on people's financial records that was unintentionally, without their permission, put out there. But you sort of answered the question as if this was a positive thing.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think I tried to answer the question by suggesting that regardless of whether or not these documents had been made public or not, the United States would continue to be a leading advocate for making more of these transactions more transparent. And the value in that is it will enhance the ability of the United States and our national security professionals to enforce U.S. sanctions, to counter corruption, to shut down terrorist financing, and put an end -- or at least limit -- the kind of illicit financing efforts that are actually contrary to U.S. national security interests.\nQ: Okay. And at the Nuclear Security Summit, the President, of course, took a question on Donald Trump. And he took the opportunity to answer pretty extensively.\nMR. EARNEST: He did.\nQ: So he gets these questions all the time now, pretty much every time he does a press conference. And lately, he has been more effusive in his responses. So does he dread these questions that he's always going to get now? Or does he relish the opportunity to counter that messaging?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, if Mr. Trump does become a nominee, I suspect that over the course of the summer and fall, as the President is campaigning for the Democratic nominee, you will -- the President will have many more opportunities to highlight the difference in approach between that which is advocated by Mr. Trump, and that which is advocated by Democrats and, in some cases, even this administration.\nI think particularly when it comes to questions related to nuclear policy, I think the President welcomed the opportunity to use Mr. Trump's unwise position to illustrate the wisdom of the approach that this administration has pursued, which is to prioritize the international effort to prevent the spread of nuclear materials. And the President was able to make a strong case in describing exactly why that is in our national security interest, and to describe the important progress that we've made over the last seven years in removing nuclear material from some 13 or 14 countries around the world. And that certainly makes that nuclear material harder to be turned into a nuclear weapon or to be stolen by terrorists with bad intentions.\nSo there are a variety of ways to make that case, but in comparison to the ill-informed, unwise, intemperate remarks of Mr. Trump, I think it only serves to illustrate the benefits of President Obama's approach.\nQ: And both you and the President have said on multiple occasions that that kind of rhetoric that some of the candidates, including Trump, have been putting out there is damaging to the U.S.'s standing in the world. Do you think that that damage has already been done?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no, I don't think that that damage has been done. I think that the damage is in concern that is expressed by people around the world about whether or not the United States is going to continue to stand for and fight for the kinds of values that have been central to this country since our nation's founding more than 200 years ago. The fact that Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates want to walk away from some of those values and, in some cases, even talk down those values isn't just disappointing, it's unsettling to our allies that continue to depend on the United States as an ardent defender of basic human rights, of smart policy, particularly when it comes to something as important as nuclear weapons or our NATO alliance.\nSo I think, ultimately, ensuring that we have leadership in the United States that continues to support those values and to be a leading advocate in fighting to advance those values isn't just critical to our national security, and it isn't just important to living up to the values that the citizens of this country have long cherished; it's also critical to ensuring strong relations with some of our closest allies around the world.\nQ: So, I mean, the President met with a number of leaders at this summit. Does he find himself needing to reassure people and counter the stuff that's been going on in the campaigns this season?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think the President spends much more time saying something to those who ask him about this in private than he does in public. And what the President has said in public is he is not particularly concerned about Mr. Trump becoming President of the United States. He doesn't think that's going to happen. He has expressed his concern about the way that other Republican candidates have in a desperate attempt to try to keep up with Mr. Trump's supposed popularity have even given voice to some of those comments.\nBut the President retains a lot of confidence in the commitment of the American people to those values, and I think that's one piece of evidence that you can point to is the way that the Democratic candidates for President have strongly supported those values throughout the campaign and have not wavered on them, even in some difficult political situations.\nSo I think that gives the President, the American people, and our allies around the world confidence that the U.S. commitment to basic human rights, to smart nuclear policy, to our NATO alliance is unwavering, despite what you hear at some Republican campaign rallies.\nQ: But you mentioned that it's unsettling to allies, that there's concern out there. So does the President have to have conversations with them about this specifically?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, he does. I think he has admitted as much at least in that news conference on Friday. But, again, the conversations that he has in public are not that different -- or in private are not different than the confidence that you heard him express previously in public.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to ask you, why and how did Senegal get in the mix when it came to the detainees? And is there a history with the Senegalese having high-value prisoners in their possession at any time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is actually the first time that Senegal has agreed to take Gitmo detainees. These two individuals are the first two Gitmo detainees to be transferred to Senegal.\nQ: Did the White House ask them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the administration did. And the State Department is obviously the lead of negotiating these diplomatic agreements with other countries to both get them to agree to take these individuals, but also to adhere to a whole set of security requirements that prevent them from posing an undue threat to U.S. national security. And the Secretary of Defense is responsible for certifying that those security requirements are sufficient to mitigate any risk that they would pose to the United States.\nQ: So is there any involvement with the African Union when it comes to these detainees in Senegal?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that, but I suppose you can check with the State Department about that.\nJuliet.\nQ: Hi, Josh. I was wondering if you could provide a little context to the HUD policy that's being rolled out today, which is saying that a person's criminal record should not be an automatic disqualifier to being able to rent housing in the United States.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the idea here -- and this is a policy that Secretary Castro will roll out -- is that the agency wants to ensure, or at least take a significant step toward ensuring that people with criminal records aren't being illegally denied housing opportunities.\nAnd the idea is to make clear to housing providers across the country that blanket bans against people with criminal records violate the Fair Housing Act when they disproportionately deny housing to people of color. And this pursuit of eliminating discrimination in the housing sector is something that President Obama has made a priority. But I can tell you it's something that both Secretary Castro and his predecessor, Shaun Donovan, who is now at OMB, also made a priority.\nAnd understanding the way that housing policy can have an influence on communities all across the country is to understand why preventing discrimination in this field is something that can have a significant impact on our broader society.\nQ: Can you describe to what extent you think this has been a problem? For example, returning offenders, or how has this played out, this idea that people in the past have been denied?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the concern, obviously, is that a broad application of a ban against people with criminal records disproportionately impacts people of color. And that is a source of significant concern. Eliminating that kind of discrimination in our housing policy can have broader societal effects.\nThe second thing is the administration has obviously made the ability of people who have served their time and paid their debt to society to reenter our society is a critical part of criminal justice reform. Giving people a second chance, particularly people who have paid their debt to society, is a priority not just to the administration, but I think to the American people. And, again, this goes to something that Speaker Ryan talked about last week, in talking about how his faith and his sense of values animates his view of the importance of giving people a second chance. And there are already a whole host of significant obstacles that people reentering society and coming out of incarceration face -- from finding a job to finding a support network.\nAnd to throw up or to erect barriers to being able to find housing is going to make it quite difficult for individuals who are emerging from our criminal justice system to establish the kind of basis that they'll need to find a job and to build a new life for themselves. So obviously this is a policy that was carefully considered by Secretary Castro, but it's one that the administration as a whole enthusiastically supports.\nQ: And just one question on the North Carolina law. In the course of the President's time in office, is there another time that you can recall the administration has done an agency-wide review of potential retaliatory response to a state law that in the eyes of the administration violated whether it's civil rights or other principles?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what you'd probably have to do is to check with individual agencies because obviously this is not a review that was ordered by the White House but rather these were individual agencies who were consulting the laws that are -- who are consulting the laws that are on the books and the policies that have been in place under this administration to determine whether some sort of response is necessary. I don't think this is something that is outside of standard operating procedure. But you'd have to talk to individual agencies to determine exactly what that standard operating procedure is.\nAnita.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about the President's trip on Thursday, just the first part, the Chicago part? Obviously he's talked about the Supreme Court before. What's the new message and why Chicago, Illinois? Is he going to call out certain senators?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, why Chicago? The President, you may recall, taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago. And returning to that venue to have a discussion about the constitutional responsibilities before the United States Senate\nReturning to that venue to have a discussion about the constitutional responsibilities before the United States Senate seems appropriate. And it will be an opportunity for the President to discuss why he considers his responsibility to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court so important. I'm confident that he'll spend a little time talking about how he arrived at the decision to nominate Chief Judge Garland for this important position.\nAnd I'm confident that the President will reiterate a case that you've heard him make a number of times now that the Senate should set aside partisan considerations and actually focus on their constitutional responsibility. He'll say that the Senate -- members of the Senate should do their job. And that's an argument that you've heard him make before, but making it in a venue where the President has previously talked about the importance of constitutional law is the idea behind Thursday's event.\nQ: Do you think he'll mention certain specific senators? He hasn't really done that.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know necessarily whether or not he will mention certain senators, although I suspect that, for example, Leader McConnell or Chairman Grassley's name might come up. They have a pretty important role in this process that they're not playing right now, and that's sort of the whole point here.\nQ: And then since he is going back home, so to speak -- and he did the same thing, Springfield, a couple months ago -- just wondering, sort of, is he feeling nostalgic? This is the second time he's gone to deliver sort of a speech about something important to him that he wants to talk about. The other was partisan politics and dysfunction in Washington. What's going on? He feeling his last year --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what's going on is that both locations are appropriate ways to illustrate how consistently the President has fought for a whole set of values and principles even before he entered the White House. So when it came to Springfield, the President devoted a significant portion of his speech before the Illinois legislature to talking about how important it was to the success of the Illinois legislature for Democrats and Republicans to be able to work together. That's something that the Illinois legislature did effectively when Senator Obama was there.\nAnd there's a similar parallel that the President is hoping to draw by traveling to the University of Chicago. Prior to entering the White House, prior to running for the United States Senate, the President spent a lot of time thinking about and writing about and talking about and teaching constitutional principles. And many of those constitutional principles are now in the broader discussion about whether or not the Senate is going to do its job, and whether or not individual senators are going to do their jobs when it comes to fulfilling their constitutional responsibility to evaluate and give a fair hearing and an up or down vote to the President's nominee to the Supreme Court.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. OMB completed its review of the fiduciary rule yesterday. And do you expect the President to roll out that rule this week?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates beyond what OMB has said about that rule. We've made a strong case about why this is -- why some changes were necessary, that right now there are too many financial advisors that are not putting their clients' interests first. And by not doing that, we've seen a waste of some $17 billion in retirement savings. That's not -- given that the President has made retirement security a top priority, we believe, frankly, that we should standardize best practices across the industry, particularly when it comes to offering retirement advice.\nThe good news here is that for financial advisors who are already placing their customers' interests at the top of the list, they don't have to do anything differently. But this is a regulation that, if and when implemented, would just focus on those individuals, those financial advisors who are not putting their customers' interests first, and that for all of the hullabaloo about this, that's why the President and the administration think this is a pretty common-sense rule.\nQ: So no timing update? Because Speaker Ryan last week was very concerned about this rule.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a timing update, but we'll keep you posted.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, can you say whether Senegal asked that its acceptance of the two detainees be portrayed as a humanitarian gesture as part of the deal to accepting them?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific requests there were made by the Republic of Senegal. But I can tell you that it's not the first time that I or my counterparts in the administration have described these kinds of transfers as a humanitarian gesture.\nQ: I wanted to ask this follow-up question about what the President said on Friday at his press conference. Why does the U.S. think that India and Pakistan pose an immediate challenge when it comes to nuclear security? What are the challenges coming from, and what did -- he is doing to address that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that the President's comments were motivated by the concern that we have about nuclear and missile developments in South Asia. In particular, we're concerned by the increased security challenges that accompany growing stockpiles, particularly tactical nuclear weapons that are designed for use on the battlefield.\nAnd these systems are a source of concern because they're susceptible to theft due to their size and mode of employment. Essentially, by having these smaller weapons, the threshold for their use is lowered, and the risk that a conventional conflict between India and Pakistan could escalate to include the use of nuclear weapons.\nSo this is why the administration has regularly expressed concern about any sort of tactical nuclear weapon. And our hope is that improvements in bilateral relations between India and Pakistan could greatly enhance prospects for lasting peace, stability and prosperity in the region. And it is important, and the United States has made this case to both countries, that there be a sustained and resilient dialogue between the two neighbors.\nAnd we're encouraging all parties in the region to act with maximum restraint and to work collaboratively toward reducing tensions in the region. Obviously, the United States benefits from the partnership that we have with both countries. We value it. And it's why we continue to make the case to our partners both in India and Pakistan that deescalating the tension between these two countries -- or between the two countries is a priority. And we've certainly made clear the concerns that we have about the development of tactical nuclear weapons, or so-called battlefield nuclear weapons.\nQ: And the issue was discussed with the Indian and Pakistan delegations at the Nuclear Security Summit last week?\nMR. EARNEST: In general, I can tell you that these are issues that we have raised with both countries directly. I don't have a lot of information about individual conversations with countries to discuss from here, but I can tell you that this is a view that we have raised directly with both India and Pakistan.\nQ: They are saying that the President's statements sort of reflects a U.S. lack of understanding of India's defense postures. Many security experts both in the U.S. and in India say that it does -- comes from China, and it's -- all modernization is based towards that --\nMR. EARNEST: Say the last part again.\nQ: India's military modernization is based towards its defense posture with -- the security that comes mostly from China, not from any other country, and the U.S., too, is part of India's defense modernization program. How do you react to India's concerns on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I will say that the United States is committed to developing the U.S.-India relationship into one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century. And that includes pursuing the strategic security dialogue that provides a dedicated venue to exchange ideas on India's intentions and defense needs, and to discuss issues that they may have related to strategic stability.\nSo these are the kinds of conversations that we have with our Indian counterparts. And we're certainly aware of the unique region of the world in which India is located. And we certainly appreciate the need India has to take the necessary steps to defend themselves. But the goal of the Nuclear Security Summit, as described earlier, was to eventually create a world without nuclear weapons. And that is a longer-term goal, and one that the President has long prioritized.\nAnd the President does believe that that is something that can be pursued consistent with the relevant national security interests of countries around the world. And we're certainly going to be particularly concerned about and attuned to the national security concerns that are expressed by close partners of the United States like India.\nAnd that said, we do believe that evolving in this direction is something that won't just enhance the national security of the United States, it will also enhance the national security of India.\nThanks a lot, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:23 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-04-04", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117086", "text": "In order to support American businesses and the workers who have driven our economic recovery, the President has repeatedly called on Congress to reform our business tax system – to close wasteful loopholes, lower our corporate tax rate and simplify the tax code for everyone. But he's also been clear that where Congress has failed to act, the Administration will do everything within its authority to ensure that the system works for hard-working Americans and our economy.\nThat's why the President is pleased that the Department of Treasury is acting again to discourage companies from taking advantage of a tax loophole known as a corporate inversion – moving their tax residence overseas on paper to avoid paying their fair share in taxes here at home. When multinational corporations exploit these loopholes – enjoying the many benefits of locating in the United States without responsibly paying into the system – it erodes the American tax base, undercuts businesses that play by the rules and ultimately leaves the middle class and small businesses to pay the tab. Business decisions should be driven by genuine business strategies and economic efficiencies, not accounting gimmicks that game our broken tax system.\nToday's actions build on the steps Treasury has already taken to reduce the tax benefits of – and when possible, stop – corporate inversions, which have helped reduce the pace of these transactions.

Hatch, R-UT, and 64 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1890, the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, and appreciates the bipartisan effort that led to the formulation of this bill. Effective protection of trade secrets promotes innovation that is the engine of the Nation's economy and minimizes threats to American businesses, the U.S. economy, and national security interests. S. 1890 would establish a Federal civil private cause of action for trade secret theft that would provide businesses with a more uniform, reliable, and predictable way to protect their valuable trade secrets anywhere in the country.\nThe Administration has placed high priority on mitigating and combating the theft of trade secrets, as exemplified in the Administration's Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement, the Administration's Strategy on Mitigating the Theft of U.S. Trade Secrets, and Executive Order 13694 authorizing sanctions on those who perpetrate cyber-enabled trade secret theft. S. 1890 would provide important protection to the Nation's businesses and industries, including through the establishment of a Federal civil cause of action for trade secret misappropriation which would effectively build upon current Federal law and various State laws that have largely adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. As such, the Administration strongly supports the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 and looks forward to working with the Congress on this important piece of legislation as it moves through the legislative process.", "timestamp": "2016-04-04", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: S. 1890 – Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016"}

In his remarks, he referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117106", "text": "The President. It's a great pleasure to welcome back once again my good friend, the Secretary General of NATO, Secretary General Stoltenberg. We are marking the 67th anniversary of the NATO alliance, and NATO continues to be the linchpin, the cornerstone of our collective defense and U.S. security policy.\nWe had an excellent meeting that started with marking the tragedy that had taken place in Brussels and reinforcing the importance of us staying focused on ISIL and countering the terrorism that has seeped up into Europe and around the world.\nAnd we agreed that one of the most important functions that NATO is performing and can continue to perform is to help in the training and assisting process for troops in Iraq, in Jordan, in many of the areas in the region. And we are continuing to cooperate on an ongoing basis about operations potentially in areas like Libya, where you have the beginnings of a government, and we can, I think, provide enormous help in helping to stabilize those countries.\nWe also discussed generally what's been happening in the southern flank of NATO. Traditionally, a lot of focus has been on the east, but we recognize that there are a broad set of challenges that have to be addressed all around the world. And NATO is going to be working with the European Union, for example, to help prevent the tragedies that we saw last summer of migrants taking very dangerous trips across waters to try to reach Europe. In cooperation with Turkey, Greece, and other countries, it's important for us to do that in a way that is humane and thoughtful, even as we're also working together to try to bring an end to the Syrian conflict.\nWe had an excellent conversation about Afghanistan, in which NATO obviously has been an extraordinary partner with the United States. The coalition there continues to focus on assisting the Government and the Afghan national security forces in building up capacity, pushing back against the Taliban, and helping to—helping Afghans to provide security for their own country and, hopefully, being able to arrive at some sort of political settlement that would end decades of conflict and violence there. And we are grateful for the sacrifices that NATO countries have made. Their men and women have fought alongside U.S. troops. They have fought together, and they've died together. And in the Warsaw summit that is coming up, we expect to be able to follow through on the pledges that we've made to continue to support the Afghan people in those efforts.\nAnd we discussed the eastern side of the equation. We continue to be united in supporting Ukraine in the wake of Russian incursions into Ukrainian territory. We continue to work in a training-and-assist fashion in helping support Ukraine develop its military capabilities defensively. We continue to provide reassurance to the frontline states there, our NATO allies, to make sure that they have not just reassurance of words, but that we have actually deployed concrete assets that let them know that article 5 means something and that we stand by our commitments to our allies. And I have in my budget put forward a quadrupling of the resources that we spend and dedicated a portion of that money to make sure that we've got ground brigades that send a clear message about our commitments to our NATO allies to the east.\nThat does not mean that we are not continuing to work with Russia to try to find resolution to the problems in Ukraine. We think it is important to maintain a dialogue, and NATO has continued to consult with Russia and, in very transparent fashion, indicate the firmness of our resolve to protect our values and our allies, but also our interest in being able to reduce tensions and the dangers of potential escalation.\nSo I just want to state how effective I think Secretary General Stoltenberg has been in managing a whole range of challenges. This is obviously a tumultuous time in the world. Europe is a focal point of a lot of these stresses and strains in the global security system. We are lucky to have a strong NATO Secretary General and a strong team that is such an excellent partner with us.\nAnd it is because of the strength of NATO and the transatlantic partnership, this transatlantic alliance, that I'm confident that, despite these choppy waters, we will be able to continue to underscore and underwrite the peace and security and prosperity that has been the hallmark of the transatlantic relationship for so many decades. Jen.\nSecretary General Stoltenberg. Thank you so much, Mr. President. It's always an honor to be here and especially on a day like this, because, as you said, today is the anniversary of our alliance; NATO was founded in this very city.\nAnd that NATO is as important as ever, because NATO has been able to adapt to a more dangerous world, not least because of your personal commitment and your personal leadership, and we are very grateful for that.\nWe stand together in the fight against terrorism. Terrorism affects us all, from Brussels to San Bernardino, and all NATO allies contribute to the U.S.-led efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL. And just last week, we started training all the Iraqi officers, and we will continue to support the efforts of the United States and other countries to fight ISIL.\nWe also discussed how NATO can increase our support to other countries in the region and ensure and enable them to stabilize their own countries and to fight ISIL, and therefore, different ways of building local capacity is high on our agenda in NATO.\nWe welcome the progress we have seen in Libya when it comes to establishing a Government of national accord, and NATO stands ready to provide support to the new Government in Libya.\nWe also addressed the migrant and the refugee crisis in Europe. NATO assists—helped the European Union, Turkey, Greece to handle the situation in the Aegean Sea, and NATO has deployed ships in the Aegean Sea.\nAfghanistan is high on our agenda. Afghanistan is our biggest military operation ever. And it shows the importance of unity in North America and Europe, because our military operation in Afghanistan is a direct response to the terrorist attack against the United States on 9/11. And European, Canadian soldiers has fought together with their—with the American soldiers in Afghanistan for many, many years.\nWe are also responding to a more assertive Russia, responsible for aggressive actions in Ukraine. And I very much welcome, again, the leadership that you have shown in increasing our collective defense in Europe with the European Reassurance Initiative, which is, as you've proposed, going to be quadrupled in the budget you have proposed for the Congress.\nThis is really a strong example of the transatlantic bond, how the United States is important for the security of Europe and also over European allies—or the European allies are also stepping up, so together, we are now implementing the biggest reinforcement to our collective defense since the end of the cold war.\nI will work together with all the NATO allies to make sure that they make good on the pledge they made together to increase defense spending. And this is about that we have to invest more in our security when tensions increases, and therefore, we have to make sure that we do what we promised, and that is to invest more in defense in the following years.\nWe will meet again in Warsaw at our summit. We have a lot to do, but I'm certain that we are—that we will deliver, because we have seen time and again that North America and Europe is able to deliver when we stand together in a strong NATO alliance.\nSo thank you once again for having me here. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-04-04", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization"}

So that we can come back to this state in November and, for the first time since 1984, paint the Badger State bright Republican red.\n\"Hillary, get ready, here we come.\"\nFull remarks below:\nGod bless the Great State of Wisconsin. What an incredible victory tonight. And thank you to your tremendous governor, Governor Scott Walker, for his principled, passionate leadership.\nTonight is a turning point. It is a rallying cry. It is a call from the hard-working men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America: we have a choice. A real choice.\nThe national political terrain began to change two weeks ago. In the state of Utah, we won 69 percent of the vote—a landslide election, winning every single delegate in the state.\nThen three days ago in Colorado, two congressional districts voted. They elected six delegates. Of those six delegates, we won all six.\nAnd then two days ago in North Dakota, we had another tremendous win. They elected their delegates. Of the delegates who have specified their support, eighteen are supporting our campaign; one is supporting Donald Trump. Eighteen to one—I'll take that ratio any day of the week.\nAnd now tonight, here in Wisconsin, a state that just three weeks the media had written off—three weeks ago the media said Wisconsin was a \"perfect state for Donald Trump.\" But the working men and women of Wisconsin stood and campaigned tirelessly to make sure that tonight was a victory for every American.\nFour very different states, Utah, Colorado, North Dakota, Wisconsin. Four victories.\nSo just how significant is tonight? Well, just today, our campaign has raised over $2 million. People all over America coming to tedcruz.org, tedcruz.org, tedcruz.org, contributing $10 or $25 or $50. We've had over 1.3 million contributions.\nIn the last two weeks, and in the coming days when Colorado and Wyoming finish voting, we are likely to have gained over 100 delegates on Donald Trump.\nAnd as a result of tonight—as a result of the people of Wisconsin defying the media, defying the pundits—I am more and more convinced that our campaign is going to earn the 1237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. Either before Cleveland or at the convention in Cleveland, together we will win a majority of the delegates and together we will beat Hillary Clinton in November.\nTonight was a bad night for Hillary Clinton. It was a bad night in the Democratic primary, and it was an even worse night for her in the Republican primary.\nWe are winning because we are uniting the Republican Party. Of the 17 candidates who started this campaign—a terrific, talented, dynamic field—five have now endorsed this campaign. Rick Perry, and Lindsey Graham, and Jeb Bush, and Carly Fiorina, and Wisconsin's own Governor Scott Walker. When you toss in Senator Mike Lee and Mark Levin, we've got the full spectrum of the Republican Party, coming together and uniting behind this campaign.\nIn 1960, accepting the Democratic Party's nomination, John F. Kennedy observed, \"I think the American people expect more from us than cries of indignation and attack. The times are too grave, the challenge too urgent, and the stakes too high to permit the customary passions of political debate. We are not here to curse the darkness, but to light the candle that can guide us to see through that darkness to a safe and sane future. As Winston Churchill said on taking office, \"If we open a quarrel between the present and the past, we shall be in danger of losing the future.\"\nThe same is true today. Tonight, Wisconsin has lit a candle guiding the way forward. Tonight, we once again have hope for our future.\nTonight is about unity, and tonight is about hope.\nYoung people in America once again have hope that we will bring jobs back to America. By repealing Obamacare, reigning in the federal regulators that are killing small businesses, passing a flat tax, and abolishing the IRS, we will unleash incredible economic growth.\nOur border will be made secure, and sanctuary cities will end.\nTruck drivers and mechanics and plumbers and steel workers, union members and the men and women with callouses on your hands, once again will see wages rising. Opportunity expanding.\nWorking moms—working moms struggling to make ends meet, will see take-home pay rising, the cost of living falling, and Common Core ending.\nCatholic schools and Jewish Day Schools, Brigham Young and the Little Sisters of the Poor, will see a Supreme Court that protects their religious liberty, the fundamental freedom of every one of us to live according to our faith and our conscience.\nWe'll see a Supreme Court that protects the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and our fundamental right to protect our families and our homes and our children.\nWe'll see a President who stands with Israel. Clearly and unapologetically.\nInstead of negotiating with terrorists, we'll rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.\nWe will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will utterly destroy ISIS.\nWe will have a President who keeps us safe.\nTo the soldiers and sailors, airmen and marines, to the police officers and firefighters, and the first responders who risk their lives to keep us safe, we will have a Commander in Chief who has...your...back.\nJobs, freedom, and security. That's what this next election is all about.\nIn 1980, Milton and Rose Friedman wrote \"Free to Choose.\" They explained that the American free enterprise system has been the greatest engine for opportunity and prosperity that the world has ever seen. Too much government can stifle opportunity, but if we get Washington out of the way there is no limit to what we can accomplish.\nIt's what allowed my Dad to escape Cuba and come to America with nothing, washing dishes making 50 cents a day, to start a business and today to be a pastor traveling the country.\nIt's what allowed my Irish-Italian Mom to become the first in her family to go to college, to smash glass ceilings by becoming a pioneering computer programmer.\nIt's what allowed my wife Heidi— I may be biased, but isn't she going to make an amazing First Lady?\nShe's the child of missionaries, my best friend in the world, and she's become a successful business leader, a loving Mom, and every day she's teaching our daughters Caroline and Catherine that strong women can accomplish anything in the United States of America.\nThat's America. It's what we're fighting for. Our children. Our future. And, Wisconsin has made clear, we are free to choose.\nFor centuries, America has been a shining city on a hill, a beacon of liberty to the world. And we can and will be once again.\nSo I ask you to join us, as we continue to unite Republicans, and Independents, and Libertarians, and Reagan Democrats and Americans who care about our future who want jobs and freedom and security. Just as we've done in Wisconsin, we're doing all across this country.\nAnd Governor let me tell you, I look forward to coming back to the state of Wisconsin this fall. And in November, for the first time since 1984, painting the Badger State bright Republican red.\nSo let me just say, Hillary, get ready, here we come.\nGod bless you!", "timestamp": "2016-04-05", "title": "Press Release - Cruz Calls Wisconsin Victory a \"Turning Point\""}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117072", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:30 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: It's pretty good when the opening act brings its own seal and flags. So, Josh, do you want to get us started with our regularly scheduled programming here?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh. Let's go back to the Panama Papers for a minute. The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned, facing questions about potential conflict of interest regarding his funds disclosed as a result of these papers. Do you think that step was called for? Do you think that there are other leaders that also may need to step aside in the wake of these disclosures?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of what the newly released documents indicate about the financial situation of any world leaders, let alone the leader of Iceland. Obviously that was a decision that the leader of Iceland made based on a variety of considerations. And I don't have a specific comment on that ultimate decision.\nObviously there are a lot of materials that have been released and that will continue to be reviewed by the general public and certainly by many of your news organizations. As the President noted, it does sort of highlight some issues that the President has been focused on for quite a long time. And I did actually want to add to one aspect of his answer about this.\nThere are some specific steps that the administration has succeeded in implementing that has been effective in countering some of the international tax avoidance schemes that were revealed in the context of this document. Many of you will recall -- or at least some of you will recall, in 2010 the President signed into law the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. FATCA was a piece of legislation that this administration aggressively pushed Congress to pass. This was legislation that was targeted at countering tax evasion by U.S. taxpayers using offshore accounts.\nThe benefits of this legislation were significant in a variety of ways. Let me discuss a couple of them. The first is that the law actually prompted countries around the world to begin reciprocal financial information-sharing agreements. That's beneficial because there are now 112 countries that exchange information with the United States about financial transactions that are occurring in their countries that were initiated, or at least that involve the other countries' citizens. So this is helpful in getting -- in providing greater transparency into the details of these financial transactions.\nSo as a result, more than 150,000 foreign financial institutions have now registered under FATCA; 150,000 financial institutions that the U.S. government now has greater clarity into as a result of the effective implementation of FATCA legislation.\nIn addition to the legislation, the Department of Justice has a Swiss bank program because of the peculiar regulations that apply to Swiss banks. Because of the greater insight that they have obtained through this program, since the end of last month the Department has entered into 78 different agreements with 80 Swiss banks that have paid more than $1.3 billion in penalties. And when it relates to the IRS -- that is the agency that's chiefly responsible for enforcing these tax regulations -- they have also, because of their efforts, gotten greater insight into the conduct of these specific foreign financial transactions.\nSince 2009, the IRS has received more than 54,000 offshore voluntary disclosures. The disclosures are voluntary because taxpayers understand that the IRS is paying new attention to these kinds of transactions, and people are interested in getting right with the law. And so we're seeing greater compliance with these laws because of the effective implementation and the effective work of the IRS.\nThe number of reports that are filed by foreign bank and financial accounts -- these are FBARs, for those who follow these issues closely -- have increased significantly over the last five or six years, from about 330,000 filings in 2008 to more than 1.1 million of them in 2015. All told, the IRS has conducted thousands of offshore-related civil audits resulting in millions of dollars of assessments. And the Department of Treasury and the IRS has pursued criminal investigations leading to billions of dollars in criminal fines and restitution.\nSo there are a variety of ways to chronicle the success that this administration has had in cracking down on some of these international tax avoidance schemes that are now in the news in a way that they haven't been previously.\nAs the President points out, we're obviously quite focused on those areas and those transactions that are not in compliance with the law. But there are significant concerns that are raised by financial transactions that, while technically legal, are egregiously unfair. They're unfair because these are tax maneuvers that are not available to middle-class families. They're only available to wealthy individuals or powerful corporations. And not only is that unfair, the consequences of these actions leads to significant loss of tax revenue that could otherwise be devoted to improving our schools, making college more affordable, or even putting people back to work building our infrastructure.\nSo the policy questions are significant. These are questions that we've been grappling with since the President's earliest days in office. And, frankly, we're pleased that this is an issue that's now in the news that's getting the kind of attention that it deserves. Hopefully it will prompt long-overdue action in the United States Congress. Right now, we've got too many Republicans in Congress who are looking out for their wealthy donors or wealthy corporate interests as opposed to pushing for the kinds of policies that would be more fair to middle-class families and better for our economy.\nQ: Aside, though, from the issue of tax avoidance and the revenues, does the fact that the leaders of so many key economies -- China, Russia, Argentina -- are now embroiled in this scandal over their finances, are the President's economic advisors concerned that that will have some negative effects on the economy or on markets?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't heard any specific concern expressed in the context of this document release. I can tell you that one of the leading items on our broader diplomatic agenda is fighting corruption. And when the President has traveled to other countries, he's talked about how important it is and how beneficial it can be for governments to prioritize transparency measures that will give people greater confidence in the trustworthiness of their government and in senior government officials.\nObviously, the United States is a strong advocate for that. There are a variety of multilateral fora -- things like ASEAN and even at the U.N. -- where the United States has pushed for higher transparency standards when it comes to good governance. That's going to continue to be a diplomatic priority. Again, I think this would also fall in the category of not a particularly sexy piece of diplomacy but still is important to the broader functioning of the international system -- both of governance and of finance.\nQ: And China has essentially imposed some type of a media blackout over this issue. They're not reporting about it in the state media. And searches on the Internet for terms related to these Panama Papers have been prohibited. Is that something the U.S. is watching? Are you raising those concerns about freedom of information with the Chinese government?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if we've raised a specific concern about this issue. But the United States regularly advocates for greater transparency and greater press freedoms around the world, including in China.\nTim.\nQ: Back to tax inversions. Why is this coming out now, since some big deals were in the works back in November and given the administration's long-term abhorrence of tax avoidance?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, look, the President has spoken out quite a bit about how unfair tax inversions are. And the President for more than two years has been calling on Congress to update the rules that are on the books that would limit the ability of corporations to essentially renounce their American citizenship, to relocate their business interests, on paper, all in an effort to avoid paying their taxes. That's not fair. It's not good for the economy.\nAnd the President has spoken out strongly against it. Unfortunately, we've seen Republicans, frankly, spend more time worrying about protecting the tax loopholes that benefit their wealthy contributors as opposed to looking for tax policies that would benefit middle-class families and the broader economy.\nWe've made no bones about our distaste for the Republicans' approach to this policy. That's why the President I think has spoken in rather colorful terms in the past about this issue. And we have seen previous steps by the Treasury Department because the President has said Congress needs to act to close these loopholes and to definitively prevent these kinds of transactions. But short of that, the President vowed to use all of the executive authority that's vested in the executive branch to take a look at this. That authority is vested in the Treasury Department. And it's the Secretary of the Treasury, Jack Lew, who has been at the forefront of putting in place regulations that could limit the ability of large corporations to benefit from these unfair tax practices. And there have been a series of announcements over the last couple of years from the Treasury Department. This is just the latest one.\nBut at the same time, I think some of the coverage has described these actions as the most significant administrative effort to prevent corporate inversions that the administration has taken. And I wouldn't quibble with that.\nI certainly have a layman's understanding of these kinds of decisions. But I do think that this announcement that Treasury made at the end of the day yesterday reflects a careful, but aggressive effort to make our tax system more fair. And it certainly doesn't eliminate the need for Congress to take action. But I think it does demonstrate how serious the administration thinks this issue is.\nQ: Is the administration worried about getting sued by companies or groups, having these regulations weakened?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly has been a common tactic of our Republican political opponents to sue the administration over policies that they don't like. I've got full confidence that the kinds of executive actions that were announced yesterday to make our tax system more fair are well within the legal authority of the administration to take.\nQ: And just one on Syria. News today of rebels shot down a Syrian jet, the second one in a month. Is this cause for concern?\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen those reports. And obviously our intelligence community has seen them, as well. At this point those are reports that we are not able to corroborate at this time.\nMichelle.\nQ: There are some concerns that these new rules, because they are so aggressive, will also affect foreign investment coming into the U.S. The expansion of foreign companies that are here; that that could then affect jobs. What do you say about that? Obviously, in your view, the breadth was needed for this round. But is it possible that this breadth now could have a real chilling effect on foreign investment?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I have only a layman's understanding of these specific policies. What I can tell you is that the Treasury Department did include certain provisions in the regulations that do not dis-incentivize foreign corporations from investing in the United States. There essentially is a way to write these rules that would target people who are looking to avoid their tax bill, while not negatively affecting foreign companies that are interested in doing legitimate business inside the United States.\nAfter all, the administration has actually gone to great lengths to encourage foreign businesses to invest in the United States, to benefit from hiring the best workers in the world. We view that as good for our economy. We view that as good for job creation. And we have put forward a whole set of incentives to encourage companies to locate inside the United States. That's been beneficial for our economy because we've seen a steady increase in that investment over the last several years, and we want to make sure that that trend continues.\nQ: Also, we just heard the President say in response to the same question from yesterday -- does he feel that Donald Trump and other candidates' rhetoric has already done damage in terms of the U.S. standing in the world -- and he unequivocally said yes, right off the bat. But yesterday you said no. So how do you sort of smooth that out? What damage is done, if any, by this rhetoric already?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I acknowledged yesterday, the fact is the President does get these kinds of questions from world leaders. Secretary of State John Kerry was on television today just indicating that every conversation he has with world leaders includes a conversation about their concerns about the political rhetoric coming from the Republican presidential candidates. That is concerning.\nI think the point that I was making, Michelle, is that that damage can be mitigated, if not outright eliminated, if the American people choose to elect someone that's serious about protecting American values and advancing American interests around the globe in a way that acknowledges the important relationships we have with allies and partners around the world.\nMr. Trump's rhetoric and the rhetoric of other Republican candidates, including Senator Cruz, doesn't reflect that. That is harmful to the United States. But over the long term, electing a successor to President Obama who understands how important those relationships are and how important it is to advocate for and defend consistently good, old-fashioned American values, that's going to be good for the country. And that will protect our standing in the world. And I'm confident this will be an important part of the argument you'll hear the President making into the summer and fall.\nQ: This is confusing, though, because you're trying to make the point that you don't want this rhetoric, that it's not good. But when we're talking about something like damage being done -- I mean, you were quick to say yesterday, no, I don't think that the damage has been done, where today the President was just as quick to say, yes, there's damage that has been done.\nSo could you just describe what is the damage? Because there are concerns out there -- nobody has been elected yet. So what is damaging? What exactly is it? And how does it affect U.S. standing? Or whatever you see the damage --\nQ: Well, look, when you have a political leader who is given a large platform and is using that opportunity to give voice to values that are inconsistent with the kinds of values that the American people have long stood and fought for -- in some cases, we're talking about values that American servicemen and women have fought and died for -- that sends a confusing signal. And the fact that important conversations that are hosted by the President of the United States or the United States Secretary of State are clouded by these kinds of discussions is not good. It's harmful. It makes those meetings less productive than they would otherwise be. That's what makes the stakes of this next election so important.\nAnd electing a President who does give voice to those values that we've long stood for, who does continue to see America has a beacon of human rights and fairness and justice and equality and democracy is a good thing not just for our government here at home, but for the standing of the United States around the world.\nQ: So you would say that the harm done is in time taken up in conversations?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, and I guess the questions that are raised in the minds of world leaders about what it is the United States is willing to stand for. And given the platform that people like Mr. Trump and Senator Cruz have used to give voice to values, frankly, that most Americans don't stand for is harmful. It's damaging. And that's why it's important, in the President's mind, to elect a President who understands that this kind of rhetoric is, in fact, damaging, and that electing a President who does demonstrate a commitment to core American values, again, is critical to making sure we have a government that the American people can be proud of, but it's also critical to shoring up the kinds of relationships that President Obama over the course of the last seven or eight years has spent repairing.\nQ: A couple of times these conversations with world leaders have been brought up in terms of how this is harmful. So do you feel that these world leaders now see the U.S. in a different light because of this election cycle?\nMR. EARNEST: I think you'd have to ask them exactly how it's changed their view.\nQ: You're saying that there's been harm and damage. So I'm trying to get a sense of what you see it being, exactly.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think I've taken a couple of shots at trying to answer your question here, so you've got some material to work with.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, just a minute ago, in the aftermath of North Carolina enacting the anti-LGBT law in the state, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant has signed into a law a religious freedom bill seemed to enable sweeping anti-LGBT discrimination. Does your sentiment that the North Carolina law is mean-spirited apply to this brand-new Mississippi law?\nMR. EARNEST: Chris, I have to acknowledge this is the first I'm hearing of the Mississippi law. But if it is as you described, the President and the administration has long been on the side of justice and equality. And some of the laws that we've seen passed that target LGBT Americans are not consistent with those values of fairness and equality. And in some cases, those laws are outright mean-spirited, and it's not something that most Americans are comfortable with.\nBut, again, I think, more importantly, a state like North Carolina in particular, you've got an influential business community. And over the last generation or so, the North Carolina economy has been revitalized because they have turned that state into a magnet for businesses, both in the technology sector but also in the financial sector. They've done that by creating a hospitable business environment. Passing laws that put those companies' employees or their customers at greater risk of being discriminated against is not a hospitable business environment.\nAnd look, the companies themselves are going to pass judgment on this and they're going to have to decide what impact this is going to have on any range of decisions that they may make about traveling to the state of North Carolina, about doing business in the state of North Carolina, about locating in the state of North Carolina. Businesses are going to have to make those kinds of decisions for themselves. But clearly, laws like this will be a factor in those decisions.\nQ: It's been reported that the administration -- the agencies are reviewing whether the North Carolina law will impact federal funding for that state. Any update on when that's to be completed? And could that investigation apply to other states that are considering similar laws, like the recently enacted law in Mississippi?\nMR. EARNEST: You'd have to talk to the individual agencies about this. Obviously, the individual agencies are taking a look to determine what impact at least the law in North Carolina would have on a range of legal and policy questions that are under their jurisdiction. The individual agencies will ensure that they're coordinating with the Department of Justice and with each other to ensure sort of a uniform interpretation of these laws if a legal interpretation is necessary.\nBut you'd have to ask the individual agencies for a timeframe about when a decision would be made. You'd also have to ask those agencies about whether or not the law that apparently was signed into law in Mississippi would trigger a similar review.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You said you wouldn't quibble with the idea that this is the most aggressive action that the President and the administration has taken against inversions. This is coming just a few weeks after Pfizer and Allergan planned to do their merger. And I know you guys said that this doesn't target one specific company, but why should we not come to the conclusion that you all were not hoping to block this deal from going forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I can say that for two reasons. One is this review of -- well, let me say it this way. Considering what sort of executive action was available to the administration to fight corporate inversions is something that was underway long before the specific deal that you referenced was announced.\nSo this is something that has long been in the works in terms of considering what options are available to the Treasury Department to taking steps to close these loopholes. And, after all, the Treasury Department is not focused on a specific transaction; they're focused on specific loopholes.\nAnd we know that there are corporations that are using these loopholes to avoid paying taxes -- that's why we're targeting them in the first place. And when I say \"them,\" I mean the loopholes, not the individual transactions. But that is the process that has been underway at the Treasury Department for a couple of years now. And, as you point out, again, the deal that you announced was something that was just referenced in -- or just announced in the last few weeks.\nQ: And there are signs that this deal could be starting to unravel. Stock has gone down, and there are analysts who say that stock is basically trading as if the deal was being more or less cancelled. I know you can't comment specifically on stock movements, but would the administration be happy if this deal did not go through or deals like this did not through in the future because of these rules?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it is fair to say that the administration would be pleased if corporate inversions that are undertaken solely to prevent companies from paying their fair share in taxes don't go through. That would be a good thing. That would be a good thing for our economy, and that would be consistent with the goals of the policy that we announced.\nHow this specific policy applies to any deals that have been announced but not yet completed, or any deals that have not yet been announced, that's something that I think individual analysts can probably speak to better than I can.\nBut as a policy matter, yes, this action is being taken by the United States government to prevent companies from being able to engage in a complicated transaction that would prevent them from paying their fair share in taxes. That's exactly what our goal is. And how it applies to individual transactions is something I can't speak to, but in terms of our policy goals, I think we've been pretty clear about what exactly they are.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about Iran and the issue of U.S. dollars being used in transactions -- financial transactions by European foreign financial institutions. I know the President said that that's not the tactic that the U.S. is hoping to take, but I was hoping to get a little bit more clarity on if there is a European company or European financial institution that wants to use dollars in its own transactions with Iran. Is that something that the U.S. is considering allowing, which it seems like it's not clear whether or not that's allowed right now to go on?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me do my best to try to clarify at least a little bit here. For the details of your question, you may have to check with the Treasury Department, because they'll understand how these complex regulations are implemented and what impact they could have on specific or pending transactions.\nWhat I can say, at least specifically, is that the United States is not preparing to reinstate so-called U-turn authorization. This is something that got some attention because we actually did make some policy changes that would allow U-turn transactions with respect to Cuba. We are not considering reinstating U-turn authorization with respect to transactions emanating from Iran.\nSecondly, I can tell you that reports that the United States is considering allowing Iran to get access to the U.S. financial system are false. But what we are interested in doing -- and this has been true for almost a year now -- we are interested in making sure that the United States and the rest of the international community lives up to the commitments that we made in the context of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\nWe're only prepared to follow through on the commitments that we made because we have verified that Iran has followed through on the commitments that they have made. Iran, for example, reduced their nuclear stockpile by 98 percent. They unplugged thousands of centrifuges. They have taken steps to render their heavy-water plutonium reactor harmless and incapable of producing fuel that could be used for a nuclear weapon.\nThere are a whole variety of steps that Iran committed to implement, including the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country's nuclear program. Because Iran has followed through on all of those steps, the United States and the rest of the international community has an obligation to follow through on giving them the kind of sanctions relief that we promised in return. That's something that we're going to follow through on. But we can do that without reinstating U-turn authorization or giving Iran access to the U.S. financial system.\nQ: Congressman Pompeo said yesterday that he's considering doing an inquiry to figure out whether or not administration officials, like Secretary of State John Kerry, misled the U.S. Congress when they were saying what's in this deal. Now that the deal is coming to fruition, they believe in some ways that they may have been misled simply on this issue of dollar transactions and European financial institutions. So I'm wondering if you have a response to that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think there's any evidence to substantiate that kind of claim. To the extent that you care about my opinion, I think you should take a rather dim view of that suggestion because Congressman Pompeo -- or however you say his name -- didn't approve the deal and certainly didn't vote in favor of it. So it's a little hard for him to suggest that he was misled about a deal he didn't support in the first place.\nWhat I am confident in is that the administration has been extraordinarily transparent about the terms of the deal when communicating with Congress about it. Time and time again, Congress has been briefed on the details of the deal. That was true even while the deal was being negotiated. And after the deal was finalized, I know that there were a variety of briefings that were held with interested administration officials. I don't know whether or not Congressman Pompeo took the time to actually attend those briefings, but that would be an interesting fact to learn.\nBecause, in fact, I know that there were actually briefings that were hosted by national security officials for the entire House of Representatives. Every member of Congress was given access to a classified briefing, to say nothing of the variety of documents that were provided to members of Congress to take a look at in person.\nSo we've got a lot of confidence in the deal that we have reached with the rest of the international community to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. It's going to enhance the national security of the United States. It's going to enhance the national security of our partners in the region, including our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel. The President is proud of this foreign policy accomplishment. And we are pleased that thus far we've able to verify that Iran has lived up to the agreement that was signed.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, back to the timing of this -- on inversions. If this Allergan-Pfizer deal had gone through, the savings would have been close to $40 billion, or in that range. It was being called one of the largest inversions of all time. Are you really saying that the timing of this move was just purely coincidental?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess for the specifics about the timing, you can check with the Treasury Department. What I can tell you is that this kind of action is something that the Treasury Department had been looking at for literally for years. Certainly their consideration of the use of this authority predated the announcement of this agreement. But again, for specifics on the timing of the announcement, I'd refer you to the Treasury Department.\nQ: But to have the President come out at this time, as well, underscores it. It's not just some Treasury action.\nMR. EARNEST: No, it's not.\nQ: I mean, it's a significant one.\nMR. EARNEST: It is.\nQ: And it's amplified by having the President speak to it.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: So you had to be aware of the symbolic resonance --\nMR. EARNEST: We're in vigorous agreement on this one, Margaret. (Laughter.)\nQ: Well, yeah. But that's why it doesn't really hold water to say, oh, we've just been waiting and the paperwork is ready to go. This was symbolically resonant, this moment. And this deal in particular made it so.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- so maybe we finally found the place where you and I disagree, which is simply this: That the President has been talking about this issue for more than two years. And there has been -- and the reason he started talking about it, frankly, was because there was a new loophole that was carved out by corporations that they were taking advantage of. We did see a steady increase in the number of corporate inversion transactions that were being carried out by companies who essentially were renouncing their U.S. citizenship, relocating their operations -- only on paper -- just to avoid paying U.S. taxes. And there were a variety of these kinds of transactions that were undertaken prior to this announcement about the Allergan-Pfizer deal.\nQ: It's been going on for a long time.\nMR. EARNEST: So the President has been quite outspoken about this. And there have been previous Treasury actions that have also been significant, both in 2014 and 2015. And there were constant questions about whether there were additional steps that the administration could take to fight inversions. And that's something that Treasury officials have been working on, like I said, for more than two years.\nAt each stage, the decisions about moving forward with these policies is focused on the specific loophole in question. And look, there's no denying that the loophole that is closed by this action is one that companies have previously taken advantage of. That's the reason we're closing it in the first place. But we're not closing it because one specific company is trying to take advantage of the loophole. We're closing it because --\nQ: Because the largest tax inversion of all time was about to happen?\nMR. EARNEST: We're closing it because a variety of companies have taken advantage of this loophole, and we're looking to prevent it.\nQ: Can I also ask you on the comments about the proposal made to stop remittances to pay for the wall with Mexico that Trump made? The President talked too -- I mean, \"Draconian,\" \"wacky,\" \"half-baked.\" Focused specifically on just stopping remittances from Mexican immigrants, would you add \"discriminatory\" to that? Or is that laundry list of problems about where you want?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen the entirety of Mr. Trump's remarks on this. But to the extent that there are any details behind this suggestion, it certainly does sound consistent with the kinds of discriminatory policies and discriminatory rhetoric that has unfortunately been the hallmark of Mr. Trump's stump speech.\nShannon, nice to see you today.\nQ: Dovetailing off of that, the President seemed to enjoy fielding a question dealing with the GOP field.\nMR. EARNEST: I think you might have been misreading his body language a little bit. (Laughter.)\nQ: Well, no, he enjoyed responding to it, maybe. And based on the reports today, that there is some level of angst that he's out in the campaign trail -- that there's a protracted Democratic primary at this point. How anxious is he to be out there campaigning?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President is certainly looking forward to the opportunity to make a strong case in favor of a Democratic candidate for President that is looking to build on the important progress that our country has made, both at home and abroad, under President Obama's leadership.\nThe President feels that that is a strong case, and I'm sure the President is looking forward to spending hours talking publicly about the evidence available to describe how exactly the United States can benefit from building on the progress that we've made. The case that is made by the Republican candidates for President is to actually roll back that progress by going back to the policies that were in place before President Obama took office.\nPresident Obama feels strongly about making an argument against that, in part because he loves his country and he wants to ensure America succeeds. That's the most important thing. The second thing is, he obviously feels a little bit of a personal investment. He obviously has dedicated the last eight years of his life to focusing on these policies that have led us to make so much progress. And he doesn't want to see so much of that work be undone.\nSo the President is certainly ready to make an affirmative case about the progress that we have made and about the prospects of continuing that progress under a Democratic leadership here in the White House.\nI will say I had not detected significant concern on his part about the longer-than-expected Democratic primary. As I've described on a couple of occasions, the longer-than-expected Democratic primary in 2008 actually accrued to the benefit of Democrats in the general election. There was a lot of concern right around this time, in 2008, that the protracted Democratic contest between Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama was going to be bad for Democrats. But I've often cited the example of the aggressively contested Indiana primary in May of 2008. It had been a generation, at least, since an Indiana primary had been so aggressively contested by Democratic candidates. But yet, there was a good four- or five-week period where Senator Clinton and Senator Obama were campaigning aggressively in the state of Indiana.\nThat allowed both of those candidates to get to know that state, to spend some time in those communities making the case for Democratic policies. Their campaigns made significant organizational investments in the state, built a grassroots infrastructure that in the general election in 2008 actually yielded important electoral fruit for the Democratic Party because Barack Obama won the state of Indiana and their electoral votes in the 2008 election. That ended up being good for the Democratic Party and for the Democratic candidate for President.\nI think it's too early to predict exactly what the long-term impact will be of this longer-than-expected Democratic primary. But I wouldn't -- and I don't -- automatically assume that the impact on the Democratic Party's electoral prospects will be negative.\nRon.\nQ: On this inversion issue, once again this is an example of the administration using executive action to get something done.\nMR. EARNEST: Because Congress has failed to act.\nQ: Because Congress has failed to act. Is there anything that you can point to as we go forward now where the administration expects to get anything done with this Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's been a little while since I've gone through this list -- let's see if I still have it in here -- but it's a long list. I want to make sure I don't forget anything off of it.\nQ: But it's a list of things to do, not the things getting done.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess you asked about sort of is there potential for us to get some things done.\nQ: No, I'm asking is there anything, not potentially -- what's getting done now --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think right now we see a lot of Republicans in the United States Senate that are not doing their jobs. That's certainly true.\nThe President has put forward a consensus nominee to the Supreme Court, for example, and we see Republicans basically saying that they're not even going to hold hearings to consider his nomination. So they're not doing their jobs in that regard.\nI think you're going to have to go ask somebody else to try to defend the work ethic of Republicans in the United States Senate right now, because I've got -- and I think everybody else here at the White House has -- significant concerns about that.\nThere are some available opportunities, though. Certainly confirming a consensus nominee to the Supreme Court would be something important that the United States Congress could do. It would be good for the country. It wouldn't require anybody to fold on their principles. But it would require the United States Senate to do their job.\nThere's been a lot of talk about criminal justice reform. Obviously, there are some Republicans in both the House and the Senate that are supportive of that effort. We heard some positive comments from Speaker Ryan 10 days or so ago about that legislation. We obviously would welcome continued bipartisan work to advance that legislation.\nThe President is hoping that at some point this year Congress will take action to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This is a trade agreement with about a dozen other countries in the Asia Pacific region. This would have important benefits for the U.S. economy, and the President has made a strong case that Democrats and Republicans should support it. We're hopeful that we can work with Republicans on that.\nBut look, we can also fight poverty by expanding the EITC, something Speaker Ryan has talked about. We can fight heroin addiction, something the President talked about last week. Republicans have been on the campaign trail saying this is a top issue. So there are a whole host of issues that we should be able to work together on.\nQ: Why would they give him any victories on any of this in the final months of his administration? And isn't this really the end of that part of this Obama presidency, working with Congress to get things done, and therefore I would expect that there's going to be more aggressive executive actions taken to try and nail some of these things down that are still on his to-do list?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly am not going to rule out aggressive executive actions. But I will say, in general, the list that I've gone through, Ron, is not the list of priorities of the Obama administration. There are a whole host of things we would love for Congress to do that they won't do because Republicans are in power, and, frankly, we've got some different priorities.\nSo closing the inversions loophole, for example, is something we would love for Congress to do. I'm not standing up here saying that that's likely to happen. In fact, I don't think it's going to because Republicans are so committed to protecting corporate interests as opposed to looking out for middle-class families.\nAnother thing that Congress could do that the President believes would be a really good thing would be raising the minimum wage. This is a way we could give some of the hardest-working people in America the opportunity to raise a family, save for retirement, send their kids to college, buy a house. And right now, the minimum wage is so low that if you are the head of a family of four and you're working full-time making minimum wage, you're raising that family below the poverty line. And that's not right, and that's something that Congress should address. But again, Republicans haven't demonstrated a willingness to considering that kind of proposal, again, because their corporate benefactors don't support it.\nSo there are a whole host of things we would like to see Congress do. But those things weren't on my list. The things that were on my list were actually things that Republicans themselves say that they support. These are things that Republicans themselves in many cases have previously been on the record supporting.\nSo the question really for Republicans is, are they willing to do their job? Are they prepared to demonstrate that they can be entrusted to govern the greatest country in the world? And if not, I think voters may have something to say about that.\nQ: And just lastly, on Judge Garland, the meeting with Senator Collins just wrapped up. It was \"excellent,\" as I'm reading, they say, so on and so forth.\nMR. EARNEST: Good.\nQ: Is there any, today, news about any other movement by any Republicans on the Hill in a very positive direction towards actually not just meeting -- let's start with meeting and then a hearing and a vote -- on the Judge Garland issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I made a reference to Senator Cornyn's comments yesterday. I mean, he is somebody who has acknowledged that it's a slippery slope for Republicans. That is why I think you've seen so many Republicans, including Leader McConnell, rule out having any sort of private meeting with Chief Judge Garland. Because it is a slippery slope -- that once you have a private meeting, then it starts to beg questions, well, why wouldn't you have a conversation with Chief Judge Garland in public? You say that you've got tough questions you want to ask him, and you're just going to ask him these questions over breakfast, for example. Well, okay. Those kinds of private meetings are sort of part and parcel of the regular process for considering a nominee, but why would you have those conversations in private? And why wouldn't you let the American people get the benefit of seeing that exchange? So it's Republicans --\nQ: So there's nothing more on his calendar?\nMR. EARNEST: But it's Republicans who indicate that the American people should have some sort of voice. Well, shouldn't the American people, if they're going to make their voices heard, have the opportunity to actually hear directly from Chief Judge Garland?\nThere haven't been that many concerns that have been raised by Chief Judge Garland. He's somebody with impeccable legal credentials. He's somebody that's described by Republicans as a consensus candidate. But to the extent that people have concerns about his nomination, he should have the opportunity to talk about them in public.\nAnd here's the thing: He's prepared to do exactly that, under oath, on camera, in front of the American people, for hours at a time. And he's willing to take tough questions from Democrats and Republicans, from the left and the right, to explain his approach. He is somebody who has a track record -- who has demonstrated that he understands the role of a judge is to interpret the law, not to advance a political agenda. And he's prepared to do that.\nNow, as it relates to the process, Chief Judge Garland met with a couple of Republicans today. You mentioned his meeting with Senator Collins; he's meeting with Senator Boozman later today. And we have seen Chairman Grassley from the Judiciary Committee indicate that the committee is prepared to accept the questionnaire when he fills it out. So that sort of is another step in this process.\nAnd I would anticipate that there will be additional meetings with additional Republican senators over the next couple of weeks. There are still a dozen or so other senators, beyond the three now, that Chief Judge Garland will have met with by the end of the day today who have also indicated an openness to a meeting.\nI think the other thing about this is it's also going to start to beg questions for other Republican senators. So let's take one example. Senator Boozman from Arkansas has indicated that he's willing, just out of good, old fashioned courtesy -- and I think probably a commitment to doing his job -- that Senator Boozman has agreed to have a meeting with Chief Judge Garland. Well, where does that leave Senator Cotton? Is he not going to show that same old-fashioned Southern hospitality to Chief Judge Garland? Is he somehow concerned about even having a private meeting with the Chief Judge?\nI don't know the answer to that. But it certainly begs that question now that his colleague from the great state of Arkansas has agreed to meet with Chief Judge Garland. And I guess we'll have to see what Senator Cotton's response to it is.\nBut again, I think Senator Cotton's refusal to have the meeting thus far is an indication that he doesn't want to edge farther out on the slippery slope that Senator Cornyn has described.\nTara.\nQ: I'm hoping you can tell me a little bit about the incident with Boko Haram and their kidnapping of girls in 2014, and what the U.S. has done since that time to help get the girls back.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Tara, obviously the United States government has been quite concerned about the tactic that Boko Haram has used to terrorize communities all across Nigeria. And the United States has been strongly supportive of the Nigerian government's efforts to find those girls, but frankly, to find the large number of people that have been kidnapped by Boko Haram.\nThe United States has some areas of expertise that we can leverage to assist in that search. So there have been military resources that have been committed to Nigeria to offer some intelligence assistance and some training to Nigerian security forces. The United States has also offered some assistance in helping Nigeria set up programs that would allow the victims of these acts of terror to recover. And some of these individuals have just been through unthinkable situations. And the humanitarian assistance that they need and the recovery to which they're entitled is something that the United States can assist the Nigerian government in providing.\nAnd part of the President's strategy to combat terrorism has been to build up the capacity of local forces in countries around the world that are partners of the United States, like Nigeria, to do a better job of providing for the security situation in their own country, to protect their citizens and to root out terrorists. And the United States is committed to assisting the Nigerians and other countries in Africa that have submitted military resources to combatting this terror threat in Africa.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two political questions. First, you spoke of world leaders expressing their concerns about some of the statements of the Republican presidential candidates. I'd like you to flesh it out for us. Has, for example, President Peсa Nieto of Mexico or any of the Latin American leaders voiced to the President or Secretary Kerry their concerns about his -- Mr. Trump's call for building a wall?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, President Peсa Nieto of Mexico, I have seen him publicly express his concerns about this specific policy proposal. And I know that at least one of his predecessors, former President Vicente Fox, has expressed some concerns about -- and I think he puts it mildly particularly as it relates to President Fox's comments -- some concerns about Mr. Trump's proposals.\nAnd as President Obama just acknowledged when he was standing up here, obviously the United States has an important economic relationship with Mexico. And it is in our country's interest to see the Mexican economy continue to at least be healthy, because if it starts to collapse, you would see a much greater influx of migrants from Mexico into the United States, at least headed this direction. And that wouldn't be good for Mexico or the United States. So that's just one example.\nI don't have details of private conversations to share with you. But look, we've seen Mr. Trump's comments about barring Muslims from entering the United States; Mr. Trump's comments about suggesting it would be just fine with him if countries in Asia, including allies of the United States, like Japan and South Korea, started to develop their own nuclear program. We've seen him advocate for the breakup of NATO, for example -- or at least the U.S. withdrawal from NATO. I think I've covered just about every region of the world now. And these are comments that he's offered up in just the last week or so.\nSo I don't think it's a particular surprise to any of you that world leaders have expressed these concerns to people like President Obama or to Secretary Kerry. I think in many cases you've heard these world leaders express these concerns publicly.\nQ: Another question on this. I was in Pennsylvania over the weekend, and the President created quite a bit of news when he, along with Vice President Biden, made a near-unprecedented step of endorsing Ms. Katie McGinty for the Democratic nomination for the Senate over former Congressman and narrow 2010 loser, Joe Sestak. Now, the President did endorse one or two incumbent House members who had primaries in 2010. But more often than not, he does not get involved in primaries unless an incumbent is there. What led him to make this decision? And has he received any comments back from Pennsylvania Democrats, including Mr. Sestak?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we talked about this a little bit last week, that there are other Senate races that are in the midst of primaries where the President has weighed in with an endorsement. Florida is a good example. There is a vigorous Democratic primary going on in Florida right now, and the President weighed in in support of Congressman Patrick Murphy from Florida, even though --\nQ: Or Congressman Grayson, another Democrat.\nMR. EARNEST: Correct. So there are a couple of examples where the President has weighed in in Democratic primaries. And I think in each case, the President and his team have carefully considered the record and agenda that is being put forward by the individual candidates. And in some cases, the President and the Vice President have chosen to weigh in.\nI don't have more detail to share with you about Ms. McGinty's race beyond what was included in the public statement. But obviously those kinds of public statements are carefully considered, and I think that's why voters in these individual states where the President does weigh in should recognize that that's a carefully considered decision. And the President only makes a decision to weigh in when he feels strongly about the benefits of one particular candidate. In most cases, it shouldn't necessarily be considered a criticism of the other Democrats. In some cases, it might. But in many cases, it shouldn't necessarily be viewed as a criticism of any of the candidates, but rather the President's strong feelings about the potential of the candidate that he endorsed.\nQ: We don't have primaries until September. Can we expect any other involvement in the internecine races for the Senate or House on the President's behalf between now and then?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm confident that there will be additional endorsements. I, at this point, don't know -- I can't telegraph at this point about whether or not there will be additional contested primaries where the President will weigh in, but I certainly wouldn't rule out that prospect.\nWe'll just do a couple more. Dave.\nQ: Back on the Garland nomination. Senator McConnell and Senator Cornyn both said today that essentially all the money and advertising in grassroots activism that progressives had done during the Easter recess to compel Republicans to accept the confirmation hearing for the nominee were a wasted effort, because we started the Easter recess two weeks ago with three Republican senators talking about allowing confirmation hearings, and now we're back to two. Do you disagree with that assessment?\nMR. EARNEST: I do disagree with that assessment primarily because I think what we have seen is actually a significant change in the position of many Republican senators when it comes to the prospect of having a private meeting with Chief Judge Garland. Traditionally, the private meeting is the first step in the confirmation process. So we were certainly pleased to see now more than a dozen Republican senators come out and indicate a willingness to meet with Chief Judge Garland. I recognize that many of them hastened to add that they wouldn't vote for him, but they also -- many of them, not all of them -- but many of them started out by saying that they didn't want to meet with him.\nSo I think that is at least one evidence in the kind of change that we've seen. I mentioned earlier the openness of the Senate Judiciary Committee to accepting the questionnaire from Chief Judge Garland. And I think what we will continue to see is continued pressure on Republicans. I made the reference to Senator Cotton. It begs questions now that he has met with Senator Boozman about whether or not Senator Cotton will participate in the same meetings. And once a number of these meetings have taken place, then it's going to start to beg the question, \"Well, why do Republicans want to have all these private conversations with Chief Judge Garland, but yet they don't want to have those conversations in public?\" Exactly what is it they're concerned about? Are they concerned that they don't actually have tough questions for Chief Judge Garland? Are they concerned that Chief Judge Garland would do so well in public that it would be very difficult for them to oppose him if the vote came to the floor? I'm not really sure exactly what the explanation is.\nAnd what's true is, we have seen -- in editorials and in news stories, and even in polls -- that the position that Republicans have taken to not do their job is extraordinarily unpopular. I think I have a pretty good explanation for that. The only explanation they can put forward for why they're not doing their job is because the Republican leadership in Washington, D.C. told them not to do their job. As Mr. Trump can attest, the Republican leadership in Washington, D.C. is not particularly popular right now.\nSo I think it would be a tough case to make to voters in an election year that you're not going to do your job under any circumstances. But when your best explanation is I'm not going to do my job because the Republican leader in the Senate told me not to, I don't think that there are many Republican voters, let alone Democrats and independents, who are going to find that an acceptable explanation. And I think that is why we're going to continue to see the pressure on Republicans continue to ramp up.\nAnd we're going to continue to make a strong case -- not that Republicans should do the President a favor, not that the Republicans should somehow fold on their principles, but rather than Republicans should just do their job. They should meet with Chief Judge Garland. They should give him a hearing. And they should give him an up or down vote.\nThis is exactly what Democrats did back in 1988. That was the last time that there was a President in office who was calling on the Senate to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court in their last year in office. Democrats had the majority at the time; President Reagan was in office. Democrats at the time confirmed Justice Kennedy; they did so unanimously. We're looking to -- we're only asking Republicans to meet the same standard that Democrats did when the show was on the other foot, and we're only asking Republicans to fulfill their basic constitutional duty. And we're only asking Republicans to consider the nomination of somebody that Republicans themselves has described as a consensus candidate.\nSo I don't really understand why this is complicated, but I do understand why it's so difficult for Republicans to assume a position of saying I'm not even going to consider the guy.\nQ: The President's event in Chicago, on Thursday, do you expect him to make those arguments that you just outlined, or talk about the judge's qualifications more? Or is he going to start going after individual Republican senators like you are today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not sure that I've gone after Republican senators.\nQ: You've been a little more specific than usual.\nMR. EARNEST: I've been a little more specific. I would not anticipate that the President would be particularly specific. I think the President is interested in making a broader legal argument in the context of a law school where he previously taught constitutional law about the importance of the United States Senate doing its job and the impact that that has on public confidence in the Court -- and not just the Supreme Court, but actually the entire federal judicial system. If it gets overly politicized and starts to break down on party lines, that's going to undermine the public confidence in the notion that when it comes to interpreting the law and the rule of law, that politics should be set aside. And so you will hear the President talk a little bit more about this, and I think it's an important argument for the American people to hear.\nQ: Speaking of constitutional law, Secretary Clinton recently referred to the topic of abortions, saying that the unborn person doesn't have a constitutional right. Does the President agree with her on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President certainly talked about his view of a woman's right to make her own health care decisions. And I recognize this has gone through the wringer quite a bit. I did not see the comments of Secretary Clinton. But we can certainly do the work to pull for you President Obama's previous thoughts on this issue.\nQ: Well, back in 2008 he said that the topic was above his pay grade, I believe. Has he evolved on that by any chance?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it sounds like you've done a little more work in looking at his past comments than I have. So why don't we take a look and we'll get back to you.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 1:30 P.M.

Are you staying warm?\nSTUDENTS: Yes!\nMRS. OBAMA: That's good. You've got hats on and everything. You guys must not be from Wisconsin. (Laughter.)\nWe've got some visitors with us today, don't we? Okay. Let me make sure who everybody is who's here today. We've got students from the Washburn Elementary School in Washburn, Wisconsin. (Applause.) Woo hoo, yay! Is it cold to you guys today?\nSTUDENT: A bit. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: A bit. That's how the Wisconsin folks feel. We've got Arthur Ashe Charter School from New Orleans, Louisiana! That's you guys, right? (Applause.) Welcome! We've got Kemper Elementary School from Cortez, Colorado. (Applause.) It's not cold to you guys, is it?\nAnd then we have our regular students from Bancroft Elementary School from right here in Washington, D.C., and from Tubman Elementary School as well, from right here in our own backyard. (Applause.) Tubman and Bancroft have been helping me plant the White House Kitchen Garden for just about eight years. So this is a very special planting. Do you guys have any idea why it's so special for me in particular? Why?\nWell, this will be the last White House Kitchen Garden planting for me in this administration. It was eight years ago that we cooked up this really interesting idea that maybe we could dig up some dirt on the South Lawn, let them do that -- maybe somebody would let us do that, and we would plant a wonderful garden that would be a space for us to talk about the food we eat. And it was always the idea that we would have kids very involved in everything that we do.\nSo young people from Tubman and Bancroft and schools from around the country, they come every planting and every harvest, and they help us put our vegetables in and take them out in the fall. And it's been really a fun tradition for us here at the White House, because I think we've really been able to change the conversation about what you guys eat. Because our thought was that if you know where your food comes from, you might be a little more interested in eating your vegetables if you know what they look like.\nBut the garden has become so much more than that. It's a place where our staff comes to volunteer. People from around the White House come, they help out. We've produced thousands of pounds of food every year that we give to homeless shelters in the area. We've gotten organizations involved. This year, we have folks from NASA here. Where are our NASA people? (Applause.) We got the space people here! (Laughter.)\nBecause, in addition to being a really important resource for us, the White House Kitchen Garden has really begun a conversation around the country about community gardens. And we've seen an increase in the number of folks that are planting community gardens in their neighborhoods. They're even doing some community gardening in space, as we understand, which takes the concept to a whole other level.\nSo the folks from NASA are going to help us plant. But we understand that there is some gardening going on up in the space station right now, and we may be doing -- some sister planting going on here. So we're very excited to have you all here. Thank you for the work that you do. Thank you for being here.\nAnd in honor of the last planting, we're going to be talking about community gardens all over the country. We're going to talk about this growth in -- community garden, and I'm going to be doing some surprise visits to community gardens around the nation. On Thursday, we're setting out to do some surprise visits in a couple of states in our country. We did a few surprise visits here just a few weeks ago, surprised a couple of schools that have some phenomenal school gardens, as well as some community farmers.\nSo we're going to be doing that just to continue to raise awareness, to talk about our successes, and to hopefully create healthier food and healthier lives for these kids. It's all about you guys, right? (Applause.) Yay for you! (Applause.)\nBut I want to take this time to thank all the kids here and all the kids around the country who have been a part of this garden. This is my baby. And hopefully, this will not be the last planting. Hopefully, there will be other administrations who come in and they take up this project and continue to make this a part of the White House tradition.\nBut in honor of those kids who have helped out, we've invited some special guests back. We have some of the kids who initially helped us plant the first garden. You guys were in fifth grade? All right, where are -- and you are now in high school. And you look different! (Laughter.) You have grown up! But all of you guys were here with me, and I kind of remember a couple of faces. You guys are, like, grown up! But I'm just happy you guys have -- coming back to help us do the last planting. You guys started with us, and you're ending with us. I'm so proud of you guys. Thank you for being here today. And you guys are pros now! (Applause.) We've come full circle.\nSo this is a great day, even though it's freezing cold to some, particularly those in D.C. As a Chicagoan, this is kind of a nice day. (Laughter.) But let's get to work. I hear you guys have your assignments. Are we ready to go? (Applause.) All right, let's move! Let's plant! Let's get it done!", "timestamp": "2016-04-05", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady at the Annual Kitchen Garden Planting"}

In his remarks, he referred to White House Press Secretary Joshua R. Earnest; and Donald J. Trump, chairman and chief executive officer, Trump Organization, and Sen. Edward R. \"Ted\" Cruz, in their capacity as Republican Presidential candidates.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117088", "text": "The President. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm horning in on Josh's time just for a hot second. As we learned last week, America's economy added 215,000 jobs in March. That means that our businesses extended the longest streak of private sector job creation on record: 73 straight months, 14.4 million new jobs, unemployment about half of what it was 6 years ago.\nNow, this progress is due directly to the grit and determination and hard work and the fundamental optimism of the American people. As I travel around the country, what always stands out is the fact that the overwhelming majority of folks work hard and they play by the rules, and they deserve to see their hard work rewarded. They also deserve to know that big corporations aren't playing by a different set of rules, that the wealthiest among us aren't able to game the system.\nThat's why I've been pushing for years to eliminate some of the injustices in our tax system. So I am very pleased that the Treasury Department has taken new action to prevent more corporations from taking advantage of one of the most insidious tax loopholes out there and fleeing the country just to get out of paying their taxes. This got some attention in the business press yesterday, but I wanted to make sure that we highlighted the importance of Treasury's action and why it did what it did.\nThis directly goes at what's called corporate inversions. They are not new. Simply put, in layman's terms, it's when big corporations acquire small companies and then change their address to another country on paper in order to get out of paying their fair share of taxes here at home. As a practical matter, they keep most of their actual business here in the United States because they benefit from American infrastructure and technology and rule of law. They benefit from our research and our development and our patents. They benefit from American workers, who are best in the world. But they effectively renounce their citizenship. They declare that they're based somewhere else, thereby getting all the rewards of being an American company without fulfilling the responsibilities to pay their taxes the way everybody else is supposed to pay them.\nWhen companies exploit loopholes like this, it makes it harder to invest in the things that are going to keep America's economy going strong for future generations. It sticks the rest of us with the tab. And it makes hard-working Americans feel like the deck is stacked against them.\nSo this is something that I've been pushing for a long time. Since I became President, we've made our Tax Code fairer, and we've taken steps to make sure our tax laws are actually enforced, including leading efforts to crack down on offshore evasion. I will say that it gets tougher sometimes when the IRS is starved for resources and squeezed by the congressional appropriation process so that there are not enough people to actually pay attention to what all the lawyers and accountants are doing all the time. But we have continued to emphasize the importance of basic tax enforcement.\nIn the news over the last couple of days, we've had another reminder in this big dump of data coming out of Panama that tax avoidance is a big, global problem. It's not unique to other countries because, frankly, there are folks here in America who are taking advantage of the same stuff. A lot of it is legal, but that's exactly the problem. It's not that they're breaking the laws, it's that the laws are so poorly designed that they allow people, if they've got enough lawyers and enough accountants, to wiggle out of responsibilities that ordinary citizens are having to abide by.\nHere in the United States, there are loopholes that only wealthy individuals and powerful corporations have access to. They have access to offshore accounts, and they are gaming the system. Middle class families are not in the same position to do this. In fact, a lot of these loopholes come at the expense of middle class families, because that lost revenue has to be made up somewhere. Alternatively, it means that we're not investing as much as we should in schools, in making college more affordable, in putting people back to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our infrastructure, creating more opportunities for our children.\nSo this is important stuff. And these new actions by the Treasury Department build on steps that we've already taken to make the system fairer. But I want to be clear: While the Treasury Department actions will make it more difficult and less lucrative for companies to exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole, only Congress can close it for good, and only Congress can make sure that all the other loopholes that are being taken advantage of are closed.\nI've often said the best way to end this kind of irresponsible behavior is with tax reform that lowers the corporate tax rate, closes wasteful loopholes, simplifies the Tax Code for everybody. And in recent years, I've put forward plans—repeatedly—that would make our tax system more competitive for all businesses, including small businesses. So far, Republicans in Congress have yet to act.\nMy hope is that they start getting serious about it. When politicians perpetuate a system that favors the wealthy at the expense of the middle class, it's not surprising that people feel like they can't get ahead. It's not surprising that oftentimes it may produce a politics that is directed at that frustration. Rather than doubling down on policies that let a few big corporations or the wealthiest among us play by their own rules, we should keep building an economy where everybody has a fair shot and everybody plays by the same rules.\nRather than protect wasteful tax loopholes for the few at the top, we should be investing more in things like education and job creation and job training that we know grow the economy for everybody. And rather than lock in tax breaks for millionaires or make it harder to actually enforce existing laws, let's give tax breaks to help working families pay for childcare or for college. And let's stop rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas and profit overseas and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here at home and are good corporate citizens.\nThat's how we're going to build America together. That's how we battled back from this great recession. That's the story of these past 7 years. That can be the story for the next several decades if we make the right decisions right now. And so I hope this topic ends up being introduced into the broader political debate that we're going to be having leading up to election season.\nOkay? And with that, I turn it over to Mr. Josh Earnest.\nIran/Corporate Tax Avoidance\nQ. A question about the Panama Papers, Mr. President?\nThe President. Yes. Q. Given the release of these millions of pages of financial information, are you concerned that that reflects on the ability of the Treasury Department to sort of be able to see all the financial transactions across the globe—they clearly didn't see these—and whether that suggests that the sanctions regime that you've put in place in a bunch of places around the world might not be as strong as you think it is?\nThe President. Well, we know the sanctions regime is strong because Iran wouldn't have, for example, cut a deal to end their nuclear program in the absence of strong sanctions enforcement.\nBut there is no doubt that the problem of global tax avoidance, generally, is a huge problem. It's been brought up in G-7 meetings. It's been brought up in G-20 meetings. There has been some progress made in coordinating between tax authorities of different countries so that we can make sure that we're catching some of the most egregious examples.\nBut as I said before, one of the big problems that we have, Michael [Michael D. Shear, New York Times], is that a lot of this stuff is legal, not illegal. And unless the United States and other countries lead by example in closing some of these loopholes and provisions, then in many cases, you can trace what's taking place, but you can't stop it. And there is always going to be some illicit movement of funds around the world. But we shouldn't make it easy. We shouldn't make it legal to engage in transactions just to avoid taxes.\nAnd that's why I think it is important that the Treasury acted on something that's different from what happened in Panama. The corporate inversions issue is a financial transaction that is brokered among major Fortune 500 companies to avoid paying taxes. But the basic principle of us making sure that everybody is paying their fair share and that we don't just have a few people who are able to take advantage of tax provisions, that's something that we really have to pay attention to.\nBecause as I said, this is all net outflows of money that could be spent on the pressing needs here in the United States. And the volume that you start seeing when you combine legal tax avoidance with illicit tax avoidance or some of the activities that we're seeing, this is not just billions of dollars. It's not even just hundreds of billions of dollars. Estimates are, this may be trillions of dollars worldwide, and it could make a big difference in terms of what we can do here.\nI'm going to take one more question, and then I'm going to turn it over to Josh. One last one, go ahead.\n2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Mr. President, the Republican frontrunner today outlined his plan to——\nThe President. Oh, no, it's—[laughter].\nQ. ——pay for a wall along the border——\nQ. Climate change?\nQ. ——barring undocumented immigrants in the U.S. from sending money back home. What would be the real implication of this plan? And are his foreign policy proposals already doing damage to U.S. relations abroad?\nThe President. The answer to the latter question is yes. I think that I've been very clear earlier that I am getting questions constantly from foreign leaders about some of the wackier suggestions that are being made. I do have to emphasize that it's not just Mr. Trump's proposals. I mean, you're also hearing concerns about Mr. Cruz's proposals, which in some ways are just as draconian when it comes to immigration, for example.\nThe implications with respect to ending remittances—many of which, by the way, are from legal immigrants and from individuals who are sending money back to their families—are enormous. First of all, they're impractical. We just talked about the difficulties of trying to enforce huge outflows of capital. The notion that we're going to track every Western Union bit of money that's being sent to Mexico, good luck with that.\nThen, we've got the issue of the implications for the Mexican economy, which in turn, if it's collapsing, actually sends more immigrants north because they can't find jobs back in Mexico. But this is just one more example of something that is not thought through and is primarily put forward for political consumption.\nAnd as I've tried to emphasize throughout, we've got serious problems here. We've got big issues around the world. People expect the President of the United States and the elected officials in this country to treat these problems seriously, to put forward policies that have been examined, analyzed, are effective, where unintended consequences are taken into account. They don't expect half-baked notions coming out of the White House. We can't afford that.\nAll right? I'm turning it over to Josh. Thank you, guys.", "timestamp": "2016-04-05", "title": "Remarks on Tax Code Reform and an Exchange With Reporters"}

He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117099", "text": "Well, good afternoon. This is one of my regular meetings with Secretary of Defense Carter, General Dunford, and our entire military leadership, including our Joint Chiefs of Staff and our combatant commanders from all around the world.\nAnd these meetings are always an opportunity for me to review our defense strategy broadly, the priorities in the budget that can realize that strategy, and most importantly, it gives us an opportunity to talk about our incredible men and women in uniform and the sacrifices they make and the health of the force, and making sure we're doing right by them.\nSecretary Carter spoke earlier today about how we have to make sure that the Department of Defense is fully organized and has all the tools that it needs to meet a wide range of emerging threats. I am very pleased that our budget agreement that we signed last year allowed us to get some relief out of sequestration. Those were some harmful cuts on both the defense and the nondefense side. But because of that relief and building on that, the budget that has been proposed makes sure that we're investing in our national security, our global leadership, and our economic security here at home.\nWe're investing in capabilities that our military needs to deter aggression and defend our security and that of our allies. And this includes increases in our posture in Europe to reassure our NATO allies in light of particularly increased aggressive actions by Russia. It allows us to enhance our maritime cooperation in the Asia-Pacific. It allows us to boost cybersecurity, which is going to be an increasing threat that has to be addressed. It allows us to invest in the future of our force, support our military families, and make sure that our technological edge is maintained relative to forces all around the world.\nThis will also be an opportunity for us to review the military campaign against ISIL. And although he is not here—because today was his retirement ceremony—I think this is a great opportunity to salute General Lloyd Austin. He served our Nation in uniform for nearly 41 years, including his repeated tours in Iraq. As commander of Central Command, he oversaw the operations from Afghanistan to Iraq and our campaign against ISIL. He did an outstanding job in every single assignment that he received. We are profoundly grateful to General Austin, his wife Charlene, and the entire Austin family.\nOur military campaign against ISIL is now being led by General Votel. And Joe has brought incredible skill and dedication to his most recent prior assignment, heading up our special forces. We are working to make sure that we're accelerating the campaign against ISIL. In Syria and Iraq, ISIL continues to lose ground. Coalition forces recently severed the main highway between ISIL's strongholds in Raqqa, Syria, and Mosul in Iraq. And we continue to take on their leadership, their financial networks, their infrastructure. We are going to squeeze them, and we will defeat them.\nBut as we've seen from Turkey to Belgium, ISIL still has the ability to launch serious terrorist attacks. One of my main messages today is that destroying ISIL continues to be my top priority. And so we can no longer tolerate the kinds of positioning that is enabled by them having headquarters in Raqqa and in Mosul. We've got to keep on putting the pressure on them. And obviously, that is not just a military operation. That is an intelligence and diplomatic effort as well. And so one of the things we'll talk about here is how we make sure that we coordinate our military activities with the efforts of our other branches of government.\nThis will continue to be a difficult fight, but I'm absolutely confident that ISIL will lose. We will prevail. And once again, this allows me to say thank you not only to these distinguished members of our Armed Forces, our core leadership that makes things happen day in, day out, but it also is a good opportunity for me, once again, to say thank you for the incredible men and women in uniform and their families who carry such an enormous burden in order to keep us free and in order to keep us safe.\nAll right?

Bernie Sanders' spokesman issued the following statement on Tuesday on how the nation's biggest banks would be broken up under a Sanders administration:\n\"Sen. Bernie Sanders and Secretary Clinton have very different points of view on how to reform Wall Street and the largest financial institutions in this country.\n\"Sen. Sanders believes that it is necessary to break up large financial institutions not only because we need to prevent another Wall Street bailout, but because of the incredible concentration of ownership and power that now rest with a handful of these huge institutions. In fact, the six largest financial institutions in this country now have assets equivalent to more than 56 percent of our nation's GDP, issue two thirds of the credit cards, and one third of the mortgages.\n\"Electing Sen. Sanders as president would send a clear message to financial regulators that they need to do everything within their power to break up financial institutions so that they can no longer threaten the financial well-being of the American people.\n\"Here's how he will accomplish that.\n\"Within the first 100 days of his administration, Sen. Sanders will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a \"Too-Big-to Fail\" list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout.\n\"Within a year, the Sanders administration will work with the Federal Reserve and financial regulators to break these institutions up using the authority of Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\"Sen. Sanders will also fight to enact a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking, investment banking and insurance services. Secretary Clinton opposes this extremely important measure.\n\"President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Glass-Steagall Act into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression. And, it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton. That is unacceptable and that is why Sen.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117071", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:04 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you. I do have some words here at the top before we get to your questions.\nFor months now, the administration has been warning about the risk posed by the Zika virus, particularly the risk that is posed to pregnant women. In early January, in the midst of a significant snowstorm that many of you may recall, the President convened his top advisors to formulate a proactive response to this epidemic, which has spread across the Americas.\nIn February, the administration formally submitted a request to Congress for $1.9 billion for activities that scientists and experts say are critically important to combatting Zika. This includes funding for mosquito control, which is particularly important now that the weather is beginning to warm up. It also includes funding for things --\nQ: Not today.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, not today. (Laughter.) At least not today in Washington.\nBut the funding also included investments in disease detection and testing, vaccine development, and support for maternal women's health.\nJust last week, the administration convened a summit in Atlanta of top state and local health officials, nonprofit officials, and health care experts. We heard from states that they're keenly aware of the threat that the disease poses, and many do not have the money that they need for basic tasks that would prevent the spread of Zika.\nOver this time, Congress has done nothing. Now, we know that we cannot continue to fund a robust response to this disease without adequate resources, particularly for our partners in state and local government who bear much of the burden of fighting Zika.\nSo earlier today, as many of you may have seen, the administration announced that we would reprogram about $600 million to bolster the ongoing Zika response. We've consistently said that an available option for the government was to repurpose some existing Ebola funds that would not undermine our fight against that deadly disease. But we also told Congress that just using some of the Ebola funds would be insufficient. And that should be an indication to you that today's actions to reprogram $600 million is a temporary fix and not at all a long-term solution.\nSince the beginning of the year, our concerns about Zika have only increased because of some new things that we've learned about the disease. First, we've learned that sexual transmission of the virus is actually more common than was initially believed. Second, we learned that the impact of the virus on fetal brain development is likely starker and more serious than first understood. Third, in the United States, the geographical range of the mosquito that carries this virus is significantly broader than our initial estimate. And as we learn more about all of these things, we continue to be concerned about the potential impact of this virus on the public health situation inside the United States.\nSo let me leave you with a couple of last thoughts. The first is that this is actually a pretty unique scenario. We've got advanced warning of a disease. It was difficult to predict in advance that Ebola would wind up in a patient that had presented himself at an American hospital. That was something that few people predicted.\nEverybody now is predicting months in advance that we're going to see more cases of Zika in the United States. That means that we have an opportunity to do something about it in advance. As I stood at this podium and talked to you about the risks that were posed by Ebola, I think many of you legitimately observed why hasn't the government done more to prepare for these kinds of situations.\nWe do have an opportunity to prepare for the Zika virus, but Congress has completely abdicated their responsibility to follow through on a proposal that the administration put forward based on the advice of scientific experts. So the administration is going to do what we can right now to fight this disease by shifting funds temporarily from the fight against Ebola into the fight against Zika. State and local officials are certainly doing their job right now to try to prepare their communities to fight Zika. Now it's time for Congress to do its job for a change.\nSo with all of that, Kathleen, do you want to get us started?\nQ: Sure. Actually, I'm going to come back to the topic from yesterday. I'm sure you saw that Pfizer and Allergan had cancelled the merger in the wake of the new inversion rules. And I'm wondering if -- I know you said that the regulations weren't explicitly targeted at that transaction, but do you have any reaction -- is this is a sign that these tough new rules have already had an impact --\nMR. EARNEST: We make it a habit of not commenting on individual transactions. That is true when transactions, or potential transactions are announced. That's also true when potential transactions are killed. So in this case, I don't have a reaction to the specific transaction.\nWe were clear yesterday that the steps that the Treasury Department was taking was not focused on any one particular transaction, but rather was focused on a loophole that we knew certain corporate interests either had previously taken advantage of or were looking to take advantage of. And so that's why they took steps to close that loophole. That, of course, does not eliminate the need for Congress to take action with regard to corporate inversions. In order to completely close the corporate inversion loophole, or frankly, the series of loopholes, we need congressional action in the form of legislation to do that definitively.\nQ: And then just on the broader topic of tax evasion, I'm wondering if you saw Senator Sanders's comment about the Panama Papers. He brought up his opposition to the U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement, and called it -- that he had warned that it would be a stamp of approval for Panama as a tax shelter. And he had criticized then-Secretary Clinton for supporting the deal, and I guess by implication also the President for signing it. I'm wondering if you have any reaction.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the simple facts are that the U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement didn't apply to tax measures. And one reason for that is that in 2011, under President Obama's leadership, the United States and Panama did conclude a Tax Information Exchange Agreement. These are the kinds of agreements that the United States maintains with other countries to promote tax transparency in creating a major disincentive for U.S. citizens to use a country like Panama, in this case, to circumvent tax laws.\nAnd what essentially that means is it means this exchange of information between the United States and Panama gives enforcement authorities here in the United States greater clarity into financial transactions that are taking place in Panama by U.S. citizens or entities. And this is not dissimilar from the kinds of information-sharing agreements that we've signed with about 112 other countries around the world as a result of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. This is the FATCA legislation that President Obama signed into law in 2010.\nAll of this has promoted greater transparency in the context of international financial transactions. That's important because it will allow the international community and the United States to do things like fight corruption, to crack down on individuals who are trying to use shell corporations to avoid paying their fair share in taxes. It also is a way for us to detect individuals or entities that are trying to circumvent U.S. financial sanctions.\nSo this greater transparency is important to our efforts, and it's something that President Obama has fought for both in the context of signing FATCA into law, but also in the context of reaching an agreement with Panama, specifically, to do a better job of exchanging information related to these financial transactions.\nQ: So Senator Sanders is off base?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I didn't see his entire comments. But the facts are that the U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement doesn't apply to tax measures. And the reason that it wasn't necessary to write into that agreement certain rules governing tax measures is we already had this existing tax information exchange agreement with Panama that promoted important transparency between our two governments when it comes to these kinds of financial transactions.\nQ: One more on the trip to Chicago. And I know you've been asked a couple of times this week, but I'm hoping you have a bit more to give us on what we should expect in terms of the remarks about the Supreme Court, the sort of tenor, the general message, and whether or not this is going to be part of an ongoing effort from the White House to keep this issue in the news -- spotlight on this --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President does consider confirming Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court a top priority, and this is an important constitutional responsibility that the President has fulfilled in terms of nominating somebody with impeccable legal credentials to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.\nThe good news is that even Republicans have described him as a consensus candidate. He is somebody who has more federal judicial experience than any other nominee to the Supreme Court in American history. And throughout that long career on the federal bench, Chief Judge Garland has demonstrated a commitment to interpreting the law, as a judge should, not seeking to advance a political agenda. This is exactly the kind of person who is worthy of a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. And we're going to continue to make the case to Republicans in the United States Senate that they should fulfill their constitutional responsibility, too, to give him a fair hearing and a timely up or down vote. Simple as that.\nThe President will certainly make that case tomorrow. And the President will continue to make that case until the Senate finally starts to do its job.\nQ: Should we expect that Judge Garland will make that case in some form or another down the road? Will he start speaking for himself?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kathleen, hopefully he'll have the opportunity to do that in the context of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.\nQ: Outside the --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen that's how the process is supposed to work. We're not at all standing up here suggesting that members of the United States Senate -- Democrat or Republican -- should just vote to confirm Chief Judge Garland because the President said to do it. In fact, we're suggesting that they should find out for themselves. And we have been pleased to see that there are a number of members of the Senate that have agreed to meet with Chief Judge Garland in private. That is traditionally how this process has worked, and we're working to set up additional meetings with Republicans to have those private conversations in the days and weeks ahead. And I understand that Chairman Grassley has even indicated that next week he's prepared to meet with Chief Judge Garland.\nThat's all good news. But I guess the thing -- the point that I would make is, why does it have to all take place in private? Why not have Chief Judge Garland go out in public, under oath, on camera and answer tough questions from individual members of the United States Senate, Democrats and Republicans? That's traditionally the way the process has worked. And our expectation is that that's the way the process should work this time.\nI suspect the reason that Republicans are resisting the process is because they too believe that Chief Judge Garland on camera, under oath, facing tough questions would demonstrate for everybody that he actually is worthy of a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. And unfortunately, Republicans are in a position where they're making complaints about this process not based on Chief Judge Garland or his credentials or his record or how he would serve the American people on the Supreme Court. In fact, you hear Republicans actually saying that this has way more to do with their political objections to the President of the United States, to President Obama.\nYou heard from Senator Cornyn that he had taken a vow not to confirm another Obama judge to the Supreme Court. You heard Ron Johnson a few weeks ago acknowledge that if a Republican were President, that the Republicans in the Senate would be treating the nominee quite a bit differently than they are now.\nSo it's Republicans who have politicized this process. And I think that's the other reason it's a little ironic that yesterday, you heard the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley do something that is pretty remarkable -- in a town and in a context like this where we're used to charges and counter-charges, and disputes across the aisle being traded back and forth -- and at least when it comes to Republicans, sometimes there are charges within the party that are being traded back and forth.\nBut I think we need to create a whole separate category when you have the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman go to the floor of the United States Senate and criticize the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and accuse him of politicizing the Supreme Court. That's a pretty remarkable turn of events. It certainly flies in the face of Chairman Grassley's well-established reputation for being a straight shooter who's focused on just getting the job done for the people of Iowa.\nBut I think the other thing is it's also remarkably ironic. Because it's Chairman Grassley who is the person who is standing in the way of this process moving forward, and it's Chairman Grassley who is suggesting that it's the President -- that it's a presidential election year, and therefore he's not going to do his job, to then turn around and say that it's actually the fault of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court that the process has gotten so politicized. It's a curious explanation.\nTim.\nQ: On Zika, why do you think the White House hasn't been able to convince Congress to push through the funding? And is the President -- or has he made calls to lawmakers on Zika?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any presidential calls to tell you about, but there have been a number of conversations with senior White House officials and senior administration officials about this legislation being a priority.\nAnd there's no reason that this should be a partisan dispute. Ron, yesterday, asked me about a range of opportunities where Democrats and Republicans should be able to work together to get something done in Congress, and I went through a lengthy list, but I didn't include Zika funding. There's no reason that Democrats and Republicans should disagree about the need to protect the American people from an impending epidemic that has serious consequences for pregnant women in this country. That surely should be something that we could figure out a way to agree on and actually take the responsible steps that are necessary to solve this problem.\nAnd, Tim, here's the other thing about this -- and in some ways, this is a little bit of human nature, and a little bit of this is some of the imperfection of our political system. But responsible adults should be able to step back and acknowledge that planning in advance, when you're talking about something like this, is really important. Mark my words, at some point -- and I don't know when it's going to be -- at some point later this spring, maybe later this summer, all of you and your news organizations are going to be sounding the alarm about the significant threat that is posed by the Zika virus. That is going to happen.\nWe know that as the weather warms up, as the mosquito population spreads, that this is something that we're going to have to deal with. And I regret, the President regrets that Congress hasn't fulfilled their responsibilities to take these steps to fight something that we know is coming. But I hope that all of you as you're writing those stories remember this day. Because the administration is fighting hard to get Congress just to fulfill their basic function and allow the federal government and our experts and state and local officials to take the steps that we know should be taken to begin to implement mosquito-control programs and try and kill mosquitoes; to start to expand our lab capacity so that we can track the virus; to start to develop better diagnostics and vaccines; and to do the other kinds of things that would allow us to put in place effective prevention tools; and where necessary, begin to stockpile necessary resources to respond to this disease.\nQ: Does the White House see lawmakers it can work with in states that might see Zika first like Florida, Texas? Does it see Republicans it can work with there?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, we're going to work with anybody who is ready to work with us. Some of the data indicates that there are a bunch of northern states that may be fortunate enough to avoid seeing this particular mosquito that carries the virus migrating to their states. But even those senators should understand how important this is. And we're willing to work with anybody -- Democrat or Republican -- to try to move this forward.\nBut you're right, most of the pressure should be on senators from states like Texas and Mississippi and Alabama and Florida and Georgia -- places where we know the climate is warmer, where the mosquito populations of this particular mosquito are likely to be larger. And, yes, there is something that all those states have in common, that they're overwhelmingly represented by Republicans in the United States Congress. So I guess at some point they're going to have to choose whether or not their animosity toward President Obama trumps their desire to try to protect pregnant women in their states from this terrible disease.\nQ: And on Pfizer and tax inversions, how would you describe the President's reaction to that? I know you don't want to comment on particular deals. But does he seem happy?\nMR. EARNEST: I think my reluctance to comment on individual deals also includes my reluctance to comment on the President's reaction to individual deals. (Laughter.)\nQ: Unhappy?\nMR. EARNEST: So, but it was a good try, though, Tim.\nQ: All right.\nMR. EARNEST: JC.\nQ: This seems like something that the President might want to bring in the governors, and we talked earlier about governors -- the Zika crisis basically. I'm understanding that the travel and tourism business in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico is suffering as a result of this. This last season was not what they hoped. Might the President go to the administrator of the Small Business Administration and discuss a possible support or aid for some of the small businesses that exist in those areas that are being affected by the perception, at least, of the Zika virus and how that effect is affecting the --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any presidential conversations that have involved that topic, but I'm confident there is somebody at the Small Business Administration who could give you a sense of what kind of resources or assistance could be provided by the federal government if that situation arises or even gets worse.\nI can tell you, though, that there already has been extensive coordination between administration officials and state and local officials. So I made a reference to last Friday in Atlanta, at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control, there was a summit that was convened with administration officials and with the top state and local health officials from across the country to discuss what our response to this should be.\nAgain, this is a pretty unique scenario. We have an opportunity to get out ahead of this disease. I don't think we're going to -- the sense is not that we can prevent it entirely, but we can begin to take steps right now before the disease is widespread in the United States that can prevent it from having the worst possible impact on our public health.\nAnd because of Congress's refusal to act, our ability to take those steps is quite limited right now -- so limited, in fact, that we are now actually having to take money away from the Ebola fight to try to at least begin some of those activities to prepare for the onset of the mosquito season and the potential spread of the Zika virus. But those resources are insufficient. We need a lot more resources to make sure we're doing everything we possibly can to protect pregnant women in the United States of America. That shouldn't be a controversial notion. In fact, it's a common-sense one.\nAnd it's going to seem pretty common sense if and when we reach the scenario where there is genuine public panic about the spread of this disease. And again, I take no joy in suggesting that Republicans are going to look back on this time that they've had to act on the Zika virus and deeply regret it. It's deeply regrettable right now that they aren't taking the necessary steps to fight this disease.\nMichelle.\nQ: I just sort of wanted to ask about -- when you talk about these limited funds, but you do have $600 million to take from Ebola, which isn't as pressing at the moment, in what ways is the lack of funding felt? So what is not being done that could be done with more money?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. So let's talk about a couple of those things. The first is it is typically local jurisdictions that are responsible for fighting mosquitoes. In some states I know that they've even set up mosquito-control districts where they can essentially tax local residents to reduce the mosquito population in those communities.\nThe sense here is knowing that this is a disease that is carried by mosquitoes that we should ramp up and expand mosquito-control efforts in communities across the country, particularly in those communities in the south where there already is a large mosquito population, and one that is only going to grow as the calendar gets closer to the summertime. So that's the first thing.\nThe second thing is that there is a lot of scientific work that needs to be done to develop diagnostics and vaccines. A lot of that work is done by the private sector, but they do so based on guarantees from the federal government. And in order to get a serious investment on the part of the private sector, the federal government needs to be able to make some commitments about a market existing for these products. So that's why we believe that longer-term funding is critically important to make available right now so the private sector has the confidence that they can go out and invest in robust production of diagnostic tools and vaccines to fight Zika.\nThere is additional work that can be done primarily by state and local health authorities to try to prepare for the eventuality that Zika arrives in the United States. And many of those preparatory activities are limited until they get sufficient funding.\nThe last thing is just laboratory capacity. If you have a situation where a whole bunch of people are going to start getting tested to see whether or not they have the Zika virus, we need to make sure that we can then process those tests rapidly enough to give people a quick response so that they can begin to take the necessary precautions if they are determined to have the Zika virus.\nHere's why that's important. Four out of five people that contract Zika won't have any symptoms. And it could potentially put individuals in a situation where they unknowingly pass the disease on to their sexual partners, for example. So that's why providing them information about whether or not they have the Zika virus is critical, and ensuring that diagnostics can be promptly processed through the labs requires additional lab capacity. And that's something that we would use funding from Congress to do.\nQ: So are you saying that at this point, the federal government can't do all that it wants to do to try to prevent Zika because of the money? Or is the money that you're transferring over adequate for X amount of time, and how much time would that be?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm suggesting is that right now the federal government needs additional resources to make sure that the federal government and state and local governments are doing all that is necessary to protect the American people from the Zika virus. It's as simple as that.\nAnd that is why we need Congress to step up to the plate and not do something controversial, not do something that guarantees anybody a political victory, but to do something that would make the American people safer from a virus that targets pregnant women and their newborn babies.\nQ: But I'm asking -- you're transferring a large amount of money. Is that allowing the federal government to do everything it wants to do for a particular amount of time? And can you tell me what that time is? Or is the federal government right now not able to do everything it wants to do because the $600 million that you're transferring is not enough?\nMR. EARNEST: Right, but what I'm suggesting is that the $600 million is not enough, and that there is more support that we would provide in particular to state and local authorities who are carrying a lot of this burden. It's state and local authorities that are going to be responsible for mosquito control. It's state and local authorities that need to ramp up their public health infrastructure to make sure that if individuals show up sick to the doctor's office, that a Zika diagnosis can be quickly made if necessary.\nQ: Okay. So it's accurate to say that the federal government would be doing more if it had more money from Congress right now. I just want to --\nMR. EARNEST: Absolutely. And we believe there is more that the federal, state and local governments should be doing with sufficient resources to protect the American people from the Zika virus. And right now, that's not happening because Congress has not done its job.\nQ: Okay, great. And on Pfizer, I know you don't want to comment on the individual cases, but you spoke very generally about what these rules want to do. So any time you have a company that would have completed a merger that would have resulted in a tax inversion that is now prevented, you would call that a success, right? Is that exactly what these rules intend?\nMR. EARNEST: The intent of the rule is to close a loophole that allows individual corporations to, on paper, move their company's operations overseas so that they can avoid paying taxes. First of all, the President thinks that that's unfair. This is a tax benefit that is not available to middle-class families. It's only available to wealthy corporations and wealthy individuals. And the lost revenue associated with individuals not -- or corporations in this case -- not paying their fair share does have an impact on our ability to invest in our schools, or in reducing the cost of a college education, or in putting people back to work building our infrastructure. That's the loss. And we're focused on closing that loophole.\nI'll let individual companies discuss how exactly they're affected by the closing of this loophole. But, yes, preventing anybody, any corporation from using this loophole to avoid paying taxes is exactly the intent of the rule.\nQ: And what would you say about the results of the primary last night? Kind of an --\nMR. EARNEST: Not much, probably. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- interesting --\nMR. EARNEST: Look, there's a lot that's been said, and I don't know that I'd have a whole lot to weigh in on it. I mean, look, Wisconsin is going to be an important state in the general election. And at some point, regardless of who the nominees are, there will be a vigorous campaign in the fall in that state.\nSo it is -- I think those who did well in the results -- or who did well in the election yesterday want to say that Wisconsin had an important role to play in the primary. I think what is clear is that Wisconsin, regardless of who the nominees are, will have an important role to play in the general. And so there will be more to come from Wisconsin voters, I'm sure, before the year is up.\nQ: But what we're hearing from the Clinton campaign is that they're going to be sort of changing their tack from here on out, that it's going to be more of trying to disqualify -- is the word that we've heard from some advisors -- Bernie Sanders. So we've already heard this kind of abrasive rhetoric from Republicans against each other. Now things might get more testy among the Democrats. What are your thoughts on that? And given the President's words on -- we heard him at I think it was a fundraiser, I think about a month ago, where he talked sort of behind the scenes and off camera about trying to unify the party. What do you think if the Democratic race is also going to be getting more contentious, I guess would be the word?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it is fair to say that Democrats have a long way to go -- a long way to go -- before they reach the level of vitriol that has been traded between the Republican candidates, to say nothing of the comments that Republican candidates have made about each other's spouses.\nBut I think what is true is the President, at some point, as the leader of the Democratic Party, as the most well-regarded figure not just in the Democratic Party, but right now in American politics, the President is going to play an important role in the general election -- first and foremost, unifying Democrats behind the Democratic nominee, but also making a strong case about his successor. And you've all heard from the President about the kind of argument that he wants to make about ensuring that he's succeeded by somebody who shares his values and is committed to building on the progress that we've made.\nBut look, there will be plenty of time for that general election to come around and for the President to spend a lot of time in public making a forceful case in support of his successor.\nQ: Is more contentiousness now at this point, though, going to lessen the unity that many see as ultimately necessary?\nMR. EARNEST: I think people expect that a Democratic primary -- or a primary on either side is going to be vigorous. I think the question is, are you focused on the issues that are most important to the American people. And I think to the extent that you have seen a debate on the Republican side, it hasn't necessarily been focused on those issues. I think it's been focused on a lot of other things. But on the Democratic side, to the extent that there have been differences between the candidates on policy, it has been focused on issues. And I think that's a healthy thing.\nJohn.\nQ: Just to follow up on that, is the President getting at all antsy sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the nominee to come with the -- clinch delegates?\nMR. EARNEST: No. The President has plenty on his plate right now. But the time will come where the President will have the opportunity to make a forceful public case about who he believes should succeed him in the Oval Office. And when that time comes, I'm confident that the President will join that debate with a lot of zest.\nQ: And then, I wanted to ask you about the minimum wage. The President put out statements earlier this week praising the governors of California and New York for their action raising the state minimum wage there to $15.00 an hour. I don't think that the budget that the President put forward had a dollar amount, but congressional Democrats have consistently talked about this $10.10 figure. Where is the President coming down on this right now? Where does he want to see the federal minimum wage go to?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has been pretty clear that he's strongly supportive of Democratic efforts in the United States Congress to raise the minimum wage. I think there are a couple of different proposals out there, and the President has simply said that it's time to give hardworking Americans a raise. And it's unfortunate that Republicans have thus far blocked that idea and blocked that legislation from moving forward.\nThe President's thinking is actually pretty simple here -- that our economy grows best when it grows from the middle out. And if we're looking for ways -- and this is what Republicans say -- to give people an incentive to go back to work, what better way to give them an incentive to work hard than to give them a raise? Right now, we're not properly incentivizing or rewarding hard work. Right now, if you're raising a family of four and you're working full-time, but only getting paid the minimum wage, you're trying to raise your family below the poverty line. The President doesn't think that that's fair. It's not good for our economy. And that's why the President is a strong advocate of raising the minimum wage.\nThere are a variety of proposals that have been floated in states, and there are a handful of proposals that have been floated in Congress. The President believes that the people who are making minimum wage in America right now deserve a raise.\nQ: The Washington Post had an op-ed that said that $15.00 an hour would represent a quantum leap in the increase in the minimum wage. Does the White House disagree with that? Does the President think that making that large of a jump from $7.25 all the way up to $15.00, or even if it's $12.00, is that something that's happening too quick, too fast?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think many of the proposals that have been floated in Congress have been phased proposals. And I think that even many of these -- I'm not familiar with all the ins and outs of municipalities and states that have raised their minimum wage. I know many of them have a phased increase in the minimum wage, and I think for common-sense reasons.\nBut look, right now you have Republicans who are saying that people who are working the minimum wage don't deserve a raise. People who are working full-time, making the minimum wage, raising a family of four, deserve to be below the poverty line. I don't really understand why that's the case that they're making. It certainly seems inconsistent not just with common sense, or a common-sense appraisal of or economy, it also seems inconsistent with the kind of rhetoric that we hear from Republicans about having access to the American Dream.\nSo we're going to continue to make our case to Republicans, but this is another example where Republicans in Congress have sided with corporate interests rather than hardworking Americans.\nLet's move around a little bit. Toluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You said earlier on inversions that you'll allow individual companies to talk about this on their own. And I wanted to give you a chance to respond to what the Allergan CEO said in an interview earlier today. He said that these new rules are un-American and they seem to have been written in a way that specifically targets this deal and no others. And he also said that these new deals will build a wall around the U.S., that there will be less foreign investment in the future. So I wanted to give you a chance to respond.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, on the last part, just as a factual matter, he's wrong about that. The Treasury Department can walk you through the technical details, but there are provisions that are included in the rules that allow for significant investments on the part of foreign countries -- or foreign companies to make investments in the United States. So that's obviously a good thing. The President has talked about how that's important for our economy over the long term. And the President has been a leading advocate of companies overseas doing that.\nThe President is going to spend some time in Germany at the end of this month, where you'll hear more from him talking about how important it is for companies around the world to invest in the United States, that they can get access to a vibrant economy. They can get access to the hardest-working, most innovative workers in the world. They can get access to a business climate where people who work hard and play by the rules have a pretty good shot at success.\nSo that is entirely consistent with the case that we've been making for some time.\nAs it relates to the other aspects of the quote, look, I think it is difficult to have a lot of patience for an American CEO trying to execute a complicated financial transaction to avoid paying taxes in America talking about what it means to be a good citizen of the United States. At this point, it's hard to have a lot of patience for the commentary on patriotism from a corporate leader who's prepared to renounce his citizenship just to avoid paying his fair share. And that's I think part of why I think the American people are strongly on the side of the government in this case. You have some corporate leaders -- look, I think most corporate leaders are trying to do the right thing for the country. Most corporate leaders in America understand that a strong American economy is good for their business. And the concern that we have is with the leaders of some corporations that are looking to take the best of America without making a contribution to the success of our country. And that's wrong.\nAnd I think -- I'm not going to have a lot of patience -- or I don't think anybody else is going to have a lot of patience for a discussion of patriotism from somebody who is advocating that kind of approach to their company's accounting practices.\nQ: Would you agree that since this was done via executive action instead of going through Congress, and since it was such a major rule change, that it's sunken this $160 billion deal that it's possible that there may be unintended consequences since Congress wasn't involved in terms of how this might affect future deals, future decisions by companies in terms of investing in the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, again, I'd refer you to the Treasury Department because I think that they have been quite thoughtful about this.\nLook, many of you observed yesterday that it took the Treasury Department a couple of years to announce these rule changes, so they clearly have thought through the consequences for this specific action. It's also why there are specific provisions in here that go to great lengths to ensure that we're not overly disincentivizing foreign companies who are seeking to invest in the United States.\nOur target here, what we're focused on is American companies that are seeking to move overseas only on paper just to avoid paying American taxes. That's the loophole that we're focused on closing. And we do believe that these rules will be helpful in pursuing that goal. But to definitively end this unpatriotic corporate practice, we need Congress to act. And more precisely we need Republicans in Congress to stop working so hard to defend corporate interests that are seeking to shirk their basic American responsibility. That's the real issue here.\nAnd look, it's not Democrats -- at least that I'm aware of -- that are opposed to closing the inversion loophole. In fact, there are a handful of Republicans who are supportive of it, including at least one presidential candidate. But yet we can't get Republicans in Congress to understand the significance of their failure to act.\nQ: One more on -- apparently WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, decided to encrypt all messages that are sent over that messaging service going forward. I'm wondering since there has been such a big debate over Apple and the FBI and terrorism, if you have a reaction to that decision by WhatsApp?\nMR. EARNEST: Not really. It doesn't change our policy or our view of how the federal government and the technology industry can and should be able to work together to ensure that robust -- or that strong encryption can be robustly deployed without giving terrorists or child pornographers or other bad actors a safe haven in cyberspace.\nSo it's complicated and it's technical, in part because these policies and the technology itself is rapidly changing. It means that we need to have a policy that can adapt along with it. That kind of innovation is healthy. We also want to make sure that we don't put in place rules that are going to stifle that innovation. That innovation is critical to the success of our economy. It's also critical to the success of strong encryption.\nBut there are areas where we've been able to work together to get this done, including fighting things like child pornography. And hopefully when it comes to keeping the American people safe from terrorism, we should be able to work together to stop that, too.\nQ: Just one clarification on the Zika thing. My colleagues who have covered this a lot closer over the last couple of months say that when Republicans have repeatedly asked on Capitol Hill of the administration, why don't you just spend some of the Ebola money that you have, the answer from the administration for the last two months has been, it's spent. We don't have it. It's allocated. There's no way we can spend any of that money. So I guess the question is: What changed between -- what changed now that changed that answer and suddenly you have half a billion dollars to spend?\nMR. EARNEST: That's not been our approach. And since we started talking about this in early February, even when I discussed this shortly after the President talked about this in the Super Bowl interview he did with CBS, we acknowledged that there were some funds that could be made available to this fight from Ebola-dedicated accounts that we could take away without completely undermining the fight against Ebola.\nQ: But you didn't do it for two months.\nMR. EARNEST: That's right.\nQ: So was that just a -- that was a political decision to keep the pressure on for two months, and then now it's bad enough that you want to go ahead and take the money?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, now we can't wait any longer for Congress to act. We simply asked Congress for the money, and they didn't act. And so now we're going to take -- we're doing the responsible thing, which is drawing on all available resources to try to meet this urgent need. But the only reason that we're having to do that, to tap in an emergency fashion these funds is because Congress for two months hasn't done a single thing.\nQ: So you didn't tell them for the last two months that this money was not available to spend?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't account for all the conversations. What I can tell you is what I've said publicly since the first Monday in February is that there would be some funding that we could use to this effort from Ebola, but that that funding level would be insufficient to meet the significant needs that we've identified, and that there's a risk associated with drawing that money away from the Ebola fight. And that's why we're going to continue to urge Congress that as they pass the Zika money, that they also make sure that they're making available funds so that we can repay the Ebola accounts that have been drawn down to deal with this emergency situation.\nThe truth is this is way more complicated than it should be. The fact is we knew back in February that this was going to be a significant issue. We put forward a specific plan to Congress about what resources would be necessary. And for two months Congress hasn't done a thing. I don't really understand how they account for that. Maybe they want to suggest that there has been some sort of miscommunication. I don't think that kind of explanation is going to fly when it comes to the American people wondering why their government didn't take all of the available steps that they knew were necessary to try to protect pregnant women and their newborn kids from the Zika virus.\nThe administration is going to have a strong case to make about what we've been doing. We've been focused on this since January. We put forward a specific plan to Congress. We've been interacting with state and local officials trying to provide them advice and support about what steps they can take to fight the Zika virus. The President had a conversation with the governors when they were here back in February about steps they could take in their own states. We convened this conference at the CDC at the end of last week. We're taking money that is available from some Ebola accounts to try to shore up this investment.\nBut all of this activity has taken place on the part of the administration and on the part of state and local officials, to be fair. But when it comes to Congress, we've gotten nothing.\nRon.\nQ: Just on the Zika thing, I'm struck by the way you're describing the circumstance that we find ourselves in. You're talking about it in the same sentence with the words Ebola. Yes, pregnant women and their newborns are the target, but it seemed to me that months ago you were trying to downplay how much of a threat to public health Zika was. You were saying how the symptoms were mild in many cases, and how it's not fatal, it's nothing like Ebola, and now it sounds like your tone has changed a lot. And the question is, has this all become just too partisan? You list this funding issue -- which is a legitimate issue -- along with six or seven other things that Congress won't act on, as we were discussing yesterday. So how much of a threat and how serious is this whole outbreak to the general population? And are you being a bit partisan about this?\nMR. EARNEST: Ron, I think I've gone to great lengths to make clear that there is no reason this should be partisan. In fact, I think I just went to great lengths to actually point out that the danger is most significant for states that are represented in the Congress by Republicans. But yet, the administration has made this a priority. The administration doesn't care any less about people who are represented in Congress by Republicans.\nWe're genuinely concerned about the health of the American people. In this case, we're concerned about pregnant women and their newborn babies who are at the greatest risk from the Zika virus.\nI have gone to great lengths to try to describe to people exactly what the risk is that is posed by the Zika virus. It's different than the risk that is posed by Ebola. There's no denying that. We've gone to great lengths to make that clear. But that doesn't mean the risk is insignificant. The risk is quite significant when you talk about the impact that this virus has on pregnant women and their newborn babies.\nAnd our concern has been enhanced by the fact that we now know that sexual transmission of this virus is actually more common than was previously thought. That is a reason for us to raise awareness among people who are not pregnant women about the risk that they could pose, and about the risk that the Zika virus could pose to them and their family.\nQ: Of all the diseases and maladies that the public health system is fighting, why is just the Ebola account that Zika money can be drawn from? I mean, I don't -- maybe there's a technical reason, but it just strikes me as odd that suddenly we're talking about Zika and Ebola in the same sentence.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think in this case, there -- well --\nQ: Because they're nothing alike.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is an illustrative thing. Here's what they do have in common. They both are reliant, at least in part, on a high-functioning public health care system to protect people. And we saw in the Ebola situation that our public health system in the United States didn't perform quite as well as we'd expected. We certainly saw that the way that a poor public health system in another country had a very real impact on the public health of the United States; that the reason that the Ebola virus got so out of control in West Africa is because they didn't have nearly the public health infrastructure in place to protect it. And in order to eventually go fight that disease, the United States military had to take it upon themselves to begin laying the ground work for the international community to come in and essentially build that public health infrastructure from the ground up.\nSo there are significant resources that were dedicated after the fact by Congress to fighting Ebola. And so this is the second thing that they have in common. Ebola didn't get people's attention until -- at least significantly in the United States, it certainly didn't get a lot of attention in Congress until somebody showed up at an American hospital with symptoms of the Ebola virus. That was a wake-up call for everybody.\nAnd we did see Congress eventually mobilize to stop it. But many of you -- or mobilize to get us the resources to stop it. Many of you I think legitimately asked, well, why did it take so long, and why did it take an incident -- somebody testing positive for Ebola in the United States for Congress to take any sort of action, or for the government to take any sort of action, to begin to prepare the American people?\nThat's exactly the opportunity that we have right now. We do know what's coming. We do know that this mosquito-borne virus is more prevalent and is likely to be more prevalent in the United States as the weather warms up. And we know that it poses significant risk to pregnant women and newborn children. That is why we're trying to get out ahead of this. We're trying to learn the lessons from Ebola. They're two different diseases -- both caused by a virus, both have different risks -- but the thing that we know is that we're going to be more effective in fighting Zika if we can start trying to prevent it in the first place.\nQ: You mentioned the military. Yesterday, the President had these meetings with his defense team and so on and so forth about ISIS. And he said in his remarks something about how we can no longer tolerate ISIL having a headquarters in Raqqa -- I think I'm quoting pretty closely. So is something going to be different now? Is there some new strategy if, in fact, we can't tolerate this existing headquarters there anymore?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President was making the case that we continue to be very focused in trying to enhance the fighting capacity of local fighters on the ground in Syria who are focused on fighting ISIL. And there have been ample public discussions about the fact that the next big objective for that fighting force is to start moving toward Raqqa.\nAnd they've made some important progress. They've severed the supply line between Raqqa and Mosul. There are some communities, including Shaddadi, on the outskirts of Raqqa, or at least in the same region as Raqqa, where they've made important progress and kicked ISIL out of that town.\nSo they're slowly encroaching on ISIL's capital. And I think the President is making clear why that objective is a priority.\nQ: The analysis was that Raqqa would be a target many months from now, it wasn't imminent. And maybe I'm wrong -- how would you characterize how imminent it is or not?\nMR. EARNEST: I certainly do not have any military training, but it is unwise to announce military operations before they've begun. I can tell you that there are many, many military airstrikes that have been carried out by the United States and our coalition partners against ISIL targets in Raqqa.\nSo there already is significant pressure that's being applied against ISIL targets in Raqqa. There already are ISIL officials in Raqqa that have been killed by U.S. military airstrikes. There are other aspects of ISIL's infrastructure in Raqqa, including financial resources, that have been destroyed by U.S. military airstrikes in Raqqa.\nSo we're already applying significant pressure against ISIL officials in their capital. But our broader objective is to enhance the capacity of local fighters on the ground to eventually drive ISIL out of that city. I don't have an updated timeframe for you on that, but that is certainly an important priority.\nQ: So that was a not routine meeting, but it was a regular meeting that he has, and so forth. And even though the strategy was assessed, as it is on an ongoing basis -- I'm trying to use some -- we should expect that that moment was not pivotal? There's nothing dramatically different that's going to be happening on the ground in that theater now, going forward, post-Brussels?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not sure I totally understand your question. The President typically meets with combatant commanders who are military uniform leaders from around the world every year or two. And he'll host all of them when they happen to be in town, invite them over to the White House. They'll do a business meeting, and then they'll have a formal dinner.\nAnd obviously, ISIL was a prominent topic of discussion, but far from the only one. There are a variety of challenges that the United States military is confronting around the globe, and those are the kinds of challenges that were discussed in the meeting, including making sure that our military leaders have the resources that are necessary to wage those fights. And the President believes all of that is important.\nWe've talked about how we're going to continue to steadily ramp up the pressure against ISIL not just in Syria, but also in Iraq, and anyplace else that extremists decide that they want to try to establish a safe haven and carry out strikes against the United States. And so that's why you've seen recent strikes in places like Somalia and Yemen and even Libya against extremists that are threatening the United States.\nAnd this is something that the President has described as his top priority. That was true before Brussels and it continues to be true today.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to ask -- two different subjects. On the Zika virus, as you're offering these warnings about the summer, what's the worst-case scenario that you've envisioning for the summer?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any specific projections to offer from here. I think that what we have seen is that we do anticipate that the mosquito that carries this virus, or is capable of carrying this virus, is likely to be more widespread in the United States than previously thought.\nPart of our concern about the Zika virus is also motivated by additional information that indicates that the Zika virus is more easily spread through sexual contact than was previously understood. We also are concerned that the Zika virus appears to have a more potent impact on infant brain development than was previously understood.\nSo there are a variety of reasons to be more concerned about this particular situation than we were early in the year. But even then, the administration was mindful of the risk that this virus posed, and we sought to communicate publicly to the American people in accurate form exactly what the risk was. But we also conveyed to Congress specifically exactly what we believed was necessary to try to fight this virus, and what steps we could take in advance of the mosquito season, if you will, to fight this disease, or to at least prepare for its arrival and spread in the United States.\nQ: So you're more ramped up now than you were about a month or two ago when you had the officials at the podium talking about the virus.\nMR. EARNEST: We have made some steps to try to ramp up our preparations. A lot of this has involved coordinating with state and local officials who, again, are going to bear the burden of this response. They're responsible for fighting mosquito populations. They're going to be responsible for the strength and effectiveness of their public health infrastructure.\nAll these are things that take place at the state and local level. And the United States government has an important responsibility to give them the resources that they need to carry out these activities. And again, this is the other reason that Congress should be taking these requests seriously, because it's not just the United States -- I'm sorry -- it's not just the President of the United States that's making this request. He's making this request on behalf of state and local officials who are desperate to ensure that they have the resources necessary to protect their citizens.\nQ: So since you're ramping everything up, what's the status of the vaccines? I remember the conversation the last time the vaccines were coming, but there were trials that were -- are you ramping that up? Well, not are you, but is there a ramp-up in that as well? And what's the status?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an updated assessment for you on that. I know that that work has been continuing, but I don't have an updated assessment. I'm sure my colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control could give you an update.\nQ: And on the last subject, is there hope that Merrick Garland will have some sort of hearing -- a Senate confirmation hearing before the end of this administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, absolutely. Just yesterday, a Republican senator, after having met with Chief Judge Garland, joined the call suggesting that the next step should be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings.\nWe've acknowledged that next week, Judge Garland will be meeting with a number of Republican senators -- I've got the list right here somewhere -- that includes, just next week, Senators Ayotte, Portman, Murkowski and Flake will be meeting with Chief Judge Garland. Chief Judge Garland will be meeting next week with the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley from Iowa.\nSo, yes, there is a continued progress that we're seeing. We've made clear -- or at least, I should say, the Senate Judiciary Committee has made clear that they're prepared to accept the questionnaire from Chief Judge Garland.\nSo this is a process that, slowly but surely, is moving forward. But we need to see Republicans demonstrate a clear commitment to actually doing their job and fulfilling their constitutional responsibility. And the idea that they're not going to do their job just because Mitch McConnell told them not to is not an explanation that's going to fly with their voters.\nQ: But the constituents in some of these states are saying -- in the Republican states are saying no; Democratic states are saying yes. I mean, you have a clear divide.\nMR. EARNEST: I disagree. And we'll provide you some publicly available polling information that are conducted by the new organizations of your colleagues that actually send a rather clear signal, even in purple states like the one that is represented in the United States Senate by Chairman Grassley, that most Republicans agree with us.\nMost Republican voters agree that members of the United States Senate should do their job, even though it's a presidential election year and even though Mitch McConnell doesn't want them to.\nQ: Can I get your private polling -- not the public one. Can you get that? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Gregory.\nQ: You didn't answer that. (Laughter.)\nQ: I wanted to go back to Pfizer but take it maybe in a slightly different direction. We also had news today out of the Justice Department on the Halliburton-Baker Hughes merger. There is a Staples-Office Depot merger that is being challenged at the Federal Trade Commission. Can you connect the dots for us on this a little bit, not just on tax policy, but anti-trust policy, consumer protection policy, financial regulation? Could you articulate what the President's attitude is towards these corporate mergers? Do they add value to the economy and to shareholders through creating more efficiencies? Or is it fair to say he's more skeptical because of the impacts these mergers often have on taxpayers and on jobs and on consumers?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's going to be hard for me to be helpful in answering this question because we're just not going to weigh in on individual financial transactions. And some of the transactions that you referred to are actually being considered by independent regulators, like at the FTC or at the Department of Justice.\nQ: And what I'm trying to do is try to ask this at a level that you can comment on. Philosophically, how does the President, how does this administration view corporate mergers?\nMR. EARNEST: I think philosophically you have to evaluate them on a case-by-case basis. And I think that's exactly what regulators do.\nLook, the President's principle here is that the United States economy is the envy of the world. There are a variety of reasons for that. But one of the reasons that we have recovered so strongly from the economic downturn in 2007 and 2008 is the President was focused on a strategy that was growing the economy from the middle out. And as long as we're focused on the best interests of middle-class families, then we're going to be doing the right thing, not just for those middle-class families but for the country.\nAnd that's the President's approach to all these economic issues. It's why the President is such a strong advocate of putting people back to work by building our infrastructure. Those are pretty good jobs. But those also lay the foundation for the long-term strength of our economy. That's why the President is a strong advocate for things like early childhood education, or lowering the cost of a college education, or even many job-training programs that ensure that American workers have the skills they need to compete in a 21st century global economy.\nThat's the way that the President sort of evaluates all of these economic circumstances, and certainly the way he evaluates economic policies. I guess it would be fair to say that assessing the impact of those kinds of transactions on middle-class families would be the way the President believes one could reasonably determine their impact on the U.S. economy.\nQ: And then on Zika, it seems to be the White House position that Congress is forcing you into a position where you have to rob Peter to pay Paul on Zika. You've talked a little bit about what you want to give to Paul. Can you talk a little bit about Peter and what exactly -- (laughter) -- what Ebola-related activities you will not be able to do because you've diverted $510 million from Ebola to Zika?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a lot of granular detail on exactly what sort of impact this will have. I will note that this is not all of the available Ebola money. We can't take our eye off the ball when it comes to Ebola. And so there are critical aspects of the fight against Ebola that are ongoing.\nNow, I think the other thing that I should clarify -- and this goes a little bit to Ron's question from earlier -- is that a lot of our Ebola funding and our efforts to fight Ebola were actually focused on improving public health infrastructures. So these are the kinds -- the shorthand for all of this is Ebola, because we saw that weaknesses in that public health infrastructure contributed to a greater risk of Ebola.\nBut the fact is, enhancing this public health infrastructure, both in the United States and around the world, can have the effect of protecting the American people from a wide variety of diseases. And that's all the more reason that we can't risk undermining those critically important investments simply because Congress won't take the necessary steps, the common-sense steps to prepare for a disease that we know is on the way.\nAnd so I will see if we can get somebody at OMB to provide you with some additional information on that. But generally speaking, that's what our approach has been.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A sad note to begin on. Merle Haggard has passed away on his 79th birthday. The country music world losing a legend. Your thoughts on his passing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, he's a legend in country music. And his passing I think is something that people all across the country -- even people who are only casual country music fans -- can appreciate. He was a legend. And he was somebody who I think told the kinds of stories that, whether you live in an urban community or a suburban community or a rural community, I think you could relate to.\nAnd so obviously his passing is a loss for country music, but it obviously is a loss for all the people who got to know him personally too. And so I say our thoughts and prayers are with his family and his friends at this time.\nQ: Thanks for that, Josh, appreciate that. I know we've talked a bit about inversions today. I want to circle back to the fiduciary rule. And if you would -- I know sometimes inside the beltway, there's sort of a technical aspect to this, but if you would help me make sense of this -- let's say somebody in Marshall or Fayette who just wants to understand broadly what the President is aiming for here. And as sort of a second part of that, what about caveat emptor -- buy beware? How much is the responsibility also on the investor to do that right thing? So if you could explain, I'd appreciate it.\nMR. EARNEST: The core principle here, Kevin, is fairness. And right now the President believes that financial advisors who are offering people retirement advice should do a pretty common-sense thing, which is that they should put the interest of their customer ahead of their own financial interests. Right now there are some financial advisors who don't abide by what's called the fiduciary standard, and instead what they do is they actually try to sell certain retirement products to their customers, even if those products may not be exactly right for their customer, given their customer's age or wealth. But by selling them those products, there are incentives that the retirement advisor, the financial advisor gets access to. They get kickbacks from the company that created the instrument in the first place, or they can be rewarded with a free cruise for themselves and their family if they sell enough shares in this particular product.\nAnd it's not fair for financial advisors to give advice for their customers that isn't in their customer's best interest. That's not honest. That's not fair. And so all the President is saying is, if you are doing this the right way, if you are abiding by the fiduciary standard, if you are eliminating that conflict of interest and making clear to your customer that your customer's interest comes first, then this rule doesn't have any impact on you.\nThis rule is aimed at those financial advisors that aren't disclosing that conflict of interest and that are not appropriately looking out for the long-term financial interests of their customers who are looking to save a little money for retirement. The consequences are significant. At least one study indicates that American families lose $17 billion each year because the advice that they're getting is not in their own personal financial interest.\nSo the President has made access to a secure retirement a top priority. We want to make sure that every family, particularly middle-class families, have access to a secure retirement. And if there are people who are going to financial advisors who are not acting in their best interest and are causing the system to bleed $17 billion in losses every year, that makes it harder for people to retire securely. And that's why the President -- or the Department of Labor, I think in this case, has put forward a rule that is focused on the simple, common-sense fairness of people who are trying to do the right thing by responsibly saving for retirement.\nQ: Can you answer the second part of that question about \"buyer beware -- you have a responsibility as well\"?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, and I think that is part of this problem, is that individual retirement advisors didn't have to disclose whether or not they were acting in their customer's best interest. And this rule makes clear that if you want to offer people retirement advice, that you have to put the financial interests of your customers first.\nQ: Okay, and last one for me. You may have seen this in the Post about paid administrative leave in federal agencies. Some pretty staggering numbers. GAO cited in this report by the Post that to the tune of millions of dollars have been wasted effectively by federal employees who have been placed on administrative leave and then receive full pay, full benefits, only to come back to work, effectively getting sometimes years of paid leave. What's your reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen that full report. I can just tell you in general that this administration has worked hard to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, particularly when it comes to the use of taxpayer dollars. That's something that we take quite seriously. And there are a variety of ways in which we have approached this, including everything from -- including most importantly, I should say, taking a look at old regulations and figuring out what sort of regulations don't make sense anymore. And by eliminating those old regulations that don't really apply, we can actually do something quite significant to save taxpayer dollars. That's just one example of the kinds of steps that we have taken to make sure that this administration is a good steward of taxpayer dollars.\nBill, nice to see you today.\nQ: Thank you very much. You devoted considerable time yesterday and some today in saying that there was no connection between the publication of the inversion rule and the cessation of the merger plan between Allergan and Pfizer. Pfizer said they dropped it because of the rule. Why should anybody believe that the timing had nothing to do with it, that the timing was not coincidental?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess the reason that people should -- the thing that people should understand is that this rule was under development and being considered by the Treasury Department four years -- years -- before these two companies even announced that that they were considering a corporate inversion. So this is a long thought-out strategy here.\nQ: Right. But the news of their pending inversion has been in the papers for days. So it was obviously about to happen.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let them speak to the timing of when they were expecting to consummate their transaction. I certainly didn't have any insight into when exactly they were planning to move forward with their transaction. What I can tell you is that the focus of this rule was to close a loophole that, yes, we knew that corporations were considering taking advantage of. There's no denying that. That's the whole reason we closed the loophole in the first place. That's the reason we targeted the loophole -- because we knew it was possible for corporations to use that loophole to avoid paying their fair share. And we went out to close it.\nLet's move around. Andrew.\nQ: Is the President considering sending more troops to Iraq?\nMR. EARNEST: Andrew, I don't have any decisions to announce from here. In considering our counter-ISIL strategy, the instructions that the President has given to his team are something that we've talked about publicly quite a bit. We obviously have a very multifaceted strategy when it comes to degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. It includes carrying out military airstrikes. It includes building the capacity of fighting forces on the ground, in Iraq and in Syria, to take the fight to ISIL on the ground in their own country. Our strategy includes countering the efforts of ISIL to finance their activities.\nOur efforts include shutting down or at least countering the ability of ISIL to recruit fighters to their cause. Our efforts include working collaboratively with countries around the world to prevent potential foreign fighters from traveling to Iraq and in Syria in the first place. And in each of those lines of effort, we've made important progress.\nWe are seeing that ISIL is struggling to pay their fighters as much as they were before. We are seeing that the number of fighters -- foreign fighters in Iraq and in Syria is lower than it has been before. We are seeing more voices, particularly in the Muslim world, speaking out against the hateful ideology of ISIL. We are seeing the capacity of fighting forces on the ground in Iraq and in Syria be enhanced. We are seeing more airstrikes being taken against ISIL targets. We are seeing that ISIL is having to withdraw from about 40 percent of the territory that they previously held in Iraq. The percentage is smaller in Syria. But there are tens of thousands of square kilometers inside of Syria that ISIL used to control that they don't anymore. All of that is a result of the efforts that we have undertaken.\nAnd what the President has said is if there is an opportunity for us to devote more resources to a particular aspect of our strategy that would allow us to yield more success, then bring me those ideas. And so there are a couple examples of that. One thing that we have seen that has been useful is to put U.S. and coalition military personnel on the ground in Iraq and in Syria to provide some advice and assistance to troops that are fighting ISIL.\nAnd the President recognized that was a strategy that was yielding some fruit in Iraq, and he decided to try that strategy in Syria, as well. And so there are Special Operations Forces in Syria right now -- a small number -- but that small number of U.S. military personnel is working to offer advice and assistance to forces that are fighting ISIL on the ground.\nSo the President is looking for ways that we can reinforce those aspects of our strategy that are yielding some progress. And if there's an opportunity for us to make more progress by putting more resources behind one particular line of effort, then the President wants to see those kinds of recommendations.\nSo at the same time, I guess just because you raise the prospect, it's important for people to understand what we're not doing. We're not going to devote tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel on the ground in Iraq and in Syria in a combat role. We tried that. That doesn't work. That doesn't address the situation on the ground. And it doesn't make the United States of America safer. So the President's strategy is one that is not going to solve this problem overnight, but it is going to make us safer. It is going to put additional pressure against ISIL. And it is more likely to lead to the kind of political outcome that we know will be required in Syria for sure, and to a different extent in Iraq, to eventually solve this problem. And that's what we're focused on.\nQ: In that regard, has he asked for or received any updates on the troop levels or troop posture since the beginning of the Mosul offensive?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has been reviewing progress on the ground. The President every couple of weeks meets with his broader national security team to talk about the progress of the counter-ISIL coalition. And that includes a regular update about the resources that are being devoted to particular lines of effort. But I don't have anything to tell you publicly at this point about any additional requests that have been made by the Department of Defense or any other member of his national security team.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. With the President going back tomorrow to the school where he once taught constitutional law, he's saying that senators, Republican senators are not doing their constitutional duty in blocking confirmation hearings for Judge Garland. Obviously, over the last two terms, Republicans have often criticized the President for exceeding his constitutional authority. I know that's not an unusual charge to come from Congress. But in a couple of big cases, the courts have dealt him setbacks on that front -- like immigration, for example. I'm just wondering can you say how the President's views have changed about the limits of presidential power since he was a law school instructor?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's a good question. I think it's probably going to be hard for me to answer. It's one that probably is best for him to answer. I can tell you --\nQ: Bring him out.\nMR. EARNEST: We could just -- like we did yesterday, just do it again? Let me go see if he's available, and we'll -- (laughter). I think -- I suppose there's an opportunity -- the President will take some questions from the audience at the event tomorrow. So maybe there's the potential that somebody would ask him this question tomorrow.\nI think in general the President believes -- and I think his record bears this out -- that he has been rather conscientious about aggressively using executive authority within the confines of the law to make progress where Congress has refused.\nAnd more often than not, when those questions have been raised in the courts, the administration has won. I think the numerous health care cases I think is a good illustration of that. You cited some examples where we have not seen the outcome that we would like. But I think the President while serving in office does appreciate how important executive authority is. And I think we've seen and our economy has benefitted from some of the decisions that the President has made or his administration has made using executive authority.\nThe irony, Dave, is that nobody questions the responsibility of the President of the United States to nominate someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. That's written into the Constitution. Rather, what we're seeing is we're seeing Republicans refuse to fulfill their basic responsibility that's written into the Constitution. So, in some ways, I think you're asking both an interesting and legitimate question about the President's view of executive authority. I think to give you a full answer it would probably require some more insight into the President's thinking, and I think you'd probably get a thoughtful answer.\nWhen it comes to the basic congressional responsibility in terms of considering Supreme Court nominees, that's a whole lot more straightforward and something I'm sure the President will talk about more tomorrow.\nMark, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Any guidance on when we'll get President Obama's tax returns?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any guidance about that right now. We will provide them before the filing deadline, which I believe this year is actually April 18th. But we'll have them before then.\nQ: His schedule today that you've given us is pretty light. Anything he's doing that you can tell us about?\nMR. EARNEST: Over the course of the day today?\nQ: Yeah.\nMR. EARNEST: The President has got some meetings with members of his team here. It is a little quieter than usual just as the President prepares for a three-day trip at the end of this week. And obviously the President was working a little later yesterday when he was hosting the combatant commanders here at the White House. But nothing specific I can tell you about.\nQ: And can you confirm that he's doing a Sunday Show interview tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you that the President, while in Chicago, will tape an interview with Chris Wallace for Fox News Sunday. It's the first time that the President has appeared on that program as President of the United States. He's done at least one other interview with Mr. Wallace since becoming President, and he did an interview for that program before being elected President. This will be the first time that he's on that program exclusively as a guest, as President of the United States.\nQ: What's your thinking in doing it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this is an opportunity for the President to -- well, let me say it this way. Obviously, Mr. Wallace is traveling to Chicago and will interview the President at the University of Chicago Law School. So I think part of our expectation in terms of preparing the President for the interview is that Mr. Wallace will want to talk to him about the Supreme Court nomination that he's put forward. And this is obviously something that Mr. Wallace has questioned his guests about quite frequently over the last several weeks. And I would anticipate that that will be true of this week's program, as well.\nBut while that will obviously be an important topic for the interview, I expect, I also expect that Mr. Wallace will ask him about some other things, too. But look, the President is looking forward to it. And I think any time that the President is doing an interview with a television program that he hasn't done an interview with for a while, it's an opportunity to reach a new audience, or at least an audience that may not have heard from the President directly in a while. So it seems like a particularly good opportunity to make a strong case that the United States Congress should fulfill their constitutional responsibility to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court that even Republicans describe as a consensus nominee.\nQ: What audience do you think he'll be reaching by going on Fox?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, as Mr. Wallace I think would point out to you, that his audience is not just Fox News viewers, but it also Fox broadcast viewers. And this is -- I'm not up to date, maybe Kevin could fill me on the latest ratings of the Sunday shows -- (laughter) --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: We wouldn't do it if it weren't. (Laughter.) But look, obviously Mr. Wallace has a well-establish reputation for asking tough questions, so I don't think anybody is expecting a softball interview here. But I also think that there's some important issues to talk about. And the President is certainly looking forward to a thoughtful and serious conversation about some of these important issues. And at least for the context in which this interview is taking place, the Supreme Court will be at the top of the list.\nQ: Is he in the exit interview phase now?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:30 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-04-06", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Are you guys having a good time?\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\nMRS. OBAMA: I hope so. I can hear you upstairs, you do know that? (Laughter.)\nWell, it is really, truly a pleasure to welcome you to the White House today. And I can't think of a better way to celebrate our second White House Nowruz than being with all of you this afternoon.\nAnd let me start by thanking Maz. I mean, we were cracking up backstage. Max, let's -- thank you so much, Maz. (Applause.) I got a chance to meet Maz backstage with his beautiful family, and he is hilarious. So I'm just grateful for that wonderful introduction, and happy that he could be here.\nI also want to thank the many members of the White House staff who have worked so hard to make this event possible. And Pany is not on the list -- I'm going to start with Pany. (Applause.) And Ferial. (Applause.) I didn't see Ferial. Ferial, where are you? Where are you? Where is she? My husband is making her work. You can blame him. (Laughter.)\nBut I want to thank those two. They are two of my favorite people. Pany -- I know, she's so embarrassed. And Ferial, love you, sweetie! (Applause.) You guys did a great job! I'm so proud of you two. I love you both. Way to go.\nAnd I want to make sure we -- to recognize our extraordinary new White House florist, Hedieh Ghaffarian. Hedieh, I saw you, you were running around without your clothes on -- (laughter) -- not dressed for the event -- with her sister. She has been phenomenal. We have gotten so many compliments on the floral arrangements here at the White House, and she has a wonderful spirit, and we're just so happy to have her on our staff. Hedieh, if you're out there, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)\nBut most of all, I want to thank all of you for joining us here today. This is an amazing group. You guys have a lot of energy, because it's the New Year and we're all very excited. We've got a pretty eclectic group here. I understand we've got the star -- one of the stars from \"Black-ish\" who's here. (Applause.) We hung out with at the Easter Egg Roll -- she told me she and her family were going to be here. We've got folks from companies like Google and Facebook. You can shout out for your people.\nWe've got the cofounder of Periscope, the video app, who is here. We've got renowned artists. We have accomplished scholars and physicians. We've got some fabulous students and musicians, and many, many others. So we're happy to have you all here. I hope that after spending the recent weeks celebrating Nowruz with your loved ones and enjoying the outdoors that you're as excited as we are to host you here.\nAnd, as we always say, this is your house. This is the People's House. Yes! (Applause.) So enjoy. As Barack said, \"Just don't break anything.\" (Laughter.)\nThat's why, when Barack and I first got here, we committed to opening this place up to as many people from as many different backgrounds as possible, especially folks who have never been through these doors before. And that's particularly true for so many of the young people we bring into this house who would have never thought they'd walk into the White House and have a place to call their own.\nWe think America is strongest when we recognize our many traditions, when we celebrate our diversity, and when we lift each other up. And in times like these, when we think all -- that's more important than ever before, right now and today with what's going on. Right now, when we're hearing so much disturbing and hateful rhetoric, it is so important to remember that our diversity has been -– and will always be -– our greatest source of strength and pride here in the United States. (Laughter.)\nWe are a nation of immigrants. And we should cherish the talent and energy and the beautiful traditions and cultures that come with that heritage, not just today but every day. But we're happy to be celebrating it right here with you all today. So I'm proud that here at the White House, we host special events to mark the holidays -- I think Maz went through a few of them -- but we celebrate St. Patrick's Day, Diwali, Cinco de Mayo. And with your help, today, we're celebrating Nowruz, which is one of our newest White House traditions.\nAnd as we celebrate this holiday and honor this tradition that is over 3,000 years old, we join families in the Middle East and in Asia, here in America, across the globe to mark both the dawning of a New Year and the arrival of spring. And hopefully we feel a little springy today, even though the weather, the temperature doesn't indicate that. (Laughter.)\nIn so many communities worldwide, Nowruz is a time to visit loved ones. It's a time to reflect on the past year, and to renew our hopes for the New Year to come. And we have a lot to reflect upon since last year's White House Nowruz. And as we consider the flowers and the trees that are finally in bloom -- isn't it beautiful outside?\nAUDIENCE: Yeah!\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, it's so good -- and the dreams and aspirations that we all share, as Americans and as human beings, I think we can have even higher hopes for peace and prosperity in the years to come.\nAs the great Persian poet Hafez once wrote -- and these are his words -- \"Out of a great need. We are all holding hands. And climbing.\" And as we come together and set our sights on the future, we have once again created this beautiful White House Haft-Seen that's behind me. (Applause.) I'd like to say I had something to do with it, but I know Hedieh did everything. (Laughter.) Just like the ones you create in your home, it is filled to the brim with our \"Seven S's\" of wishes for the year ahead –- from grass sprouts representing the blooming of nature, to apples for health and beauty -- which I believe in, deeply -- and many other symbols of love and joy.\nAnd because no Nowruz celebration would be complete without plenty of food to share with family and friends, I hope that you all have enjoyed all the traditional dishes I haven't had a chance to taste yet -- (applause) -- some of which feature the ingredients from our very own White House Kitchen Garden. Yes! (Applause.) So I want us to take a moment to thank our fabulous guest chef Najmieh Batmanglij. (Applause.) I got to meet Najmieh and her family back in the back, and she told me to make sure I tried the soup because it brings good luck. So I'm going to do that.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Asheh Reshteh!\nMRS. OBAMA: What?\nAUDIENCE: Asheh Reshteh!\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, all right. I'm going to try some! (Laughter.) And Najmieh worked, of course, with our amazing White House chefs. Let's give them all a round of applause. (Applause.) I hope the food has been good.\nAnd finally, for our entertainment today we have the Nomad Dancers. And all the way from Vienna, we have the Center for Persian Classical Music, directed by Nader Majd, who is here. (Applause.) They're going to be performing for us shortly, and I know they will be amazing.\nSo let me just end by thanking you all. Thank you for your love, and your friendship, and your support, and your kind words, and your prayers, and your hard work, and the pride with which you live and raise your children. Because, in the end, it's all about our kids, right?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Correct!\nMRS. OBAMA: We are creating a country and a world -- yes! That's the proud mother. I see your daughter right there. (Laughter.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.\nMRS. OBAMA: Thank you. This is -- oh. (Applause.) Thank you. We are honored to have you here at the White House. So I want you to make yourselves at home. I want you to enjoy every second of it. And just remember, we are always with you. We are thinking and working for you every single day.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!\nMRS. OBAMA: We love you too.

But today, the rules of the road do not ensure that financial advisers act in their clients' best interest when they give retirement investment advice.\nInstead, some firms incentivize advisers to steer their clients into products that may have higher fees and lower returns. This is called a \"conflict of interest\"—and this type of retirement advice costs American families an estimated $17 billion a year.\nToday, we're doing something about it.\nThanks to President Obama's leadership, the Labor Department issued new rules to help ensure that if you pay someone for retirement advice, they are legally obligated to look out for your best interest. This announcement is another critical step in the President's effort to put in place the strongest consumer protections in American history, while fighting back efforts by Wall Street to block these critical protections from going forward or to unravel the progress we've made.\nElaine Toffel from Lindhurst, Illinois is one of the millions of Americans whose retirement savings will better be protected because of this rule. Elaine, who's now in her mid-70s, and her late husband Merlin worked their whole lives so they could rest easy in their golden years. They got bad advice to invest in expensive annuities that made it hard for them to access their money. Suddenly, they were short on cash—which is exactly what they tried to avoid by saving and acting responsibly all those years. They were taken advantage of by a financial adviser of an institution where they had been longtime clients—an institution they trusted.\nPresident Obama talked about Elaine and Merlin's story when he called on the Department of Labor to act last year. Today, as the rule was finalized, he wrote Elaine a letter to thank her family for raising their voice as active citizens to help solve this problem.\nDear Elaine:\nToday, as we finalized new rules to protect Americans saving for retirement, my thoughts turn to you and your family. I am so sorry that Merlin could not share this moment with you, but I want you to know that the courage you both showed in sharing your story made all the difference.\nThanks to you and Merlin, generations of responsible Americans—tens of millions of people—will receive retirement advice in their best interest. They may never know your name, but they'll live out their golden years with a little more dignity because of people like you. You showed that even in the face of steep odds and special interests, thoughtful and committed citizens can change their country for the better.\nSo I just want you to know how proud I am of you and your family. Next year, when I leave the White House, I'll still hold the title of citizen, just like you.

But today, the rules of the road do not ensure that financial advisers act in their clients' best interest when they give retirement investment advice. Instead, some firms incentivize advisers to steer clients into products that may have higher fees and lower returns. These conflicts of interest in retirement advice cost America's families an estimated $17 billion a year.\nThat's why today, at President Obama's direction, the Department of Labor (DOL) is finalizing a rule and related exemptions to ensure that retirement savers get investment advice in their best interest, so they can grow their nest egg and be better prepared for retirement. These rules will save affected middle-class families tens of thousands of dollars for their retirement over a lifetime of savings. And they'll level the playing field for the many good actors, so that retirement advisers will compete based on the quality of advice they give.\nSince DOL issued its first proposal in 2010 and its second proposal last April, the Administration has received extensive feedback from industry, advocates, Congress, federal and state regulators, and others. The rule being released today reflects this input and is better for it. DOL has streamlined the rule and exemptions to reduce the compliance burden and ensure continued access to advice, while maintaining an enforceable best interest standard that protects consumers.\nToday's announcement is another critical step in the President's ambitious effort to put in place the strongest consumer protections in American history, while fighting back efforts by Wall Street and their allies to hinder the progress we have made. These new retirement protections add to stronger rules of the road for mortgages, credit cards, and student loans, among others.\n•      Conflicts of Interest in Retirement Advice Are Hurting the Middle Class: The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) finds conflicts of interest lead, on average, to:\no      1 percentage point lower annual returns on retirement savings.\no      $17 billion of losses every year for America's families.\n•      President Obama Is Cracking Down on Conflicts of Interest: Today, the DOL is finalizing rules requiring retirement investment advisers to meet a \"fiduciary\" standard—putting their clients' best interest before their own profits. These reforms will save affected middle-class families tens of thousands of dollars in retirement savings over a lifetime of saving and level the playing field for the many financial advisers who are already doing right by their clients.\n•      Final Rule and Related Exemptions Reflect Significant Changes Based on Comments Received: Following its proposal in April 2015, DOL conducted a comment period lasting over 5 months and received extensive feedback through 4 days of public hearings, over 3,000 comments, and more than 100 meetings. Based on this input, DOL has streamlined and simplified the rule to minimize the compliance burden and ensure ongoing access to advice, while maintaining an enforceable best interest standard that protects savers.\nConflicts of Interest in Retirement Advice Cost Savers Billions of Dollars\nSince Congress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974, there has been a dramatic shift from employer-sponsored defined benefit plans to self-directed IRAs and 401(k)s. These changes have increased the need for good retirement advice, yet until today the ERISA rules governing retirement investment advice had not been meaningfully updated since 1975. While many investment advisers acted in their customers' best interest, not everyone was legally obligated to do so. Instead, the broken regulatory system had allowed misaligned incentives to steer customers into investments that have higher fees or lower returns—costing some middle-class families tens of thousands of dollars of their retirement savings.\nAnalysis by the President's Council of Economic Advisers last year showed that:\n•      Working and middle class families receiving conflicted advice earn returns roughly 1 percentage point lower each year (for example, conflicted advice reduces what would be a 6 percent annual return to a 5 percent return).\n•      An estimated $1.7 trillion of IRA assets were invested in products that generally provide payments that generate conflicts of interest. Thus, CEA estimated that the aggregate annual cost of conflicted advice is about $17 billion each year.\n•      A typical worker who receives conflicted advice when rolling over a 401(k) balance to an IRA at age 45 will lose an estimated 17 percent from her account by age 65. In other words, if a worker has $100,000 in retirement savings at age 45, without conflicted advice it would grow to an estimated $216,000 by age 65 adjusted for inflation, but if she receives conflicted advice it would grow to $179,000—a loss of $37,000 or 17 percent.\nRule Ensures Retirement Savers Get Advice in Their Best Interest\nToday's rule and related exemptions will ensure retirement savers get advice in their best interest, while minimizing the compliance burden on the many advisers who already put their clients' best interest first. The rule defines fiduciary investment advice, while the accompanying exemptions allow advisers and their firms to continue to receive most common forms of compensation if they put their clients' best interest first. The rulemaking package also includes a regulatory impact analysis outlining the monetary harm caused to retirement investors from conflicted advice and the expected economic impacts of the rule.\n•      The rule requires more retirement investment advisers to put their client's best interest first, by expanding the types of retirement advice covered by fiduciary protections. Today large loopholes in the definition of retirement investment advice expose many middle-class families, and especially IRA owners, to advice that may not be in their best interest. Under the rule, any individual receiving compensation for making investment recommendations that are individualized or specifically directed to a particular plan sponsor running a retirement plan (e.g., an employer with a retirement plan), plan participant, or IRA owner for consideration in making a retirement investment decision is a fiduciary. Being a fiduciary means that the adviser must provide impartial advice in their client's best interest and cannot accept any payments creating conflicts of interest unless they qualify for an exemption intended to assure that the customer's interests are protected. This change expands protections to IRA owners and people rolling over their savings into an IRA from a 401(k), who now must receive investment advice in their best interest.\n•      The rule clarifies what does and does not constitute fiduciary advice. The rule includes examples of communication that would not rise to the level of a recommendation and thus would not be considered advice. It specifies that education is not included in the definition of retirement investment advice so advisers and plan sponsors can continue to provide general education on retirement saving without triggering fiduciary duties.\n•      The exemptions will allow firms to accept common types of compensation – like commissions and revenue sharing payments – if they commit to putting their client's best interest first. Under the best interest contract (BIC) exemption, firms (and their individual advisers) can continue to receive most common forms of compensation for advice to retail customers and small plan sponsors to invest in any asset so long as the firms:\no      Commit the firm and adviser to providing advice in the client's best interest, charge only reasonable compensation, and avoid misleading statements about fees and conflicts of interest.\no      Adopt policies and procedures designed to ensure that advisers provide best interest advice, and prohibiting financial incentives for advisers to act contrary to the client's best interest.\no      Disclose conflicts of interest. The firm must direct the customer to a webpage disclosing the firm's compensation arrangements and make customers aware of their right to complete information on the fees charged.\nThe final package also revises existing exemptions, including limiting the so-called \"insurance exemption\" to recommendations of \"fixed rate annuity contracts.\" To sell other insurance products like variable and indexed annuities, firms can use the BIC exemption. New preamble language emphasizing that fees are not the only factor in making investment decisions and giving firms more flexibility on how to comply with disclosure provisions should also make it easier for insurance firms to recommend their products.\n•      The rule and exemptions ensure that advisers are held accountable to their clients if they provide advice that is not in their clients' best interest. If advisers and firms do not adhere to the standards established in the exemption, retirement investors will be able to hold them accountable—either through a breach of contract claim (for IRAs and other non-ERISA plans) or under the provisions of ERISA (for ERISA plans and participants).\nFinal Rule and Exemptions Contain Significant Changes Based on the Feedback Received\nIn addition to the public input on its 2010 Proposal, following its proposal in April 2015, DOL conducted a comment period lasting over 5 months and received extensive feedback in 4 days of public hearings, over 3,000 comment letters (as well as over 300,000 petitions), and more than 100 meetings with stakeholders.\nSpecifically, among other things, the Department has:\n•      Further clarified what constitutes fiduciary advice. The final rule defines a variety of investment education activities that fall short of fiduciary conduct, and makes clear that advisers do not act as fiduciaries merely by recommending that a customer hire them to render advisory or asset management services. The final rule also expressly provides that investment advice does not include communications that a reasonable person would not view as an investment recommendation, including general circulation newsletters, television, radio, and public media talk show commentary, remarks in widely attended speeches and conferences, research reports prepared for general circulation, general marketing materials, and general market data. Under the final rule, all appraisals (as opposed to just ESOP appraisals in the proposal) will not be considered advice for purposes of this rule but will be reserved for a future rulemaking.\n•      Made best interest contract (BIC) exemption available for more advice. Comments expressed concerns that advisers and firms could not take advantage of the BIC exemption if they were recommending proprietary products. Additionally, commenters asked the Department to expand the proposed exemption to apply to products not listed in the exemption (such as listed options and non-traded REITs), and to permit recommendations to sponsors of participant-directed plans like 401(k)s. In response, the final rule and exemptions reflect the following changes:\no      Advisers recommending any asset—not just those on an asset list included in the proposal—can take advantage of the BIC exemption to continue receiving most common forms of compensation.\no      BIC exemption will be available for advice to small businesses that sponsor 401(k) plans, as well as for advice to IRA customers and plan participants. Additionally, under the final rule, recommendations to plan sponsors managing more than $50 million in assets (vs. $100 million in the proposed rule) will not be considered investment advice if certain conditions are met and hence will not require an exemption.\no      BIC exemption includes special provisions clarifying how it can be used for recommendation of proprietary products, including a requirement that firms determine that the limitations are not so severe that the adviser will generally be unable to satisfy the exemption's best interest standard and other requirements.\n•      Streamlined and simplified requirements of BIC exemption. Responding to feedback from commenters, the Department has taken a number of steps to streamline the BIC exemption to lower compliance costs for firms implementing it and ensure that firms can continue offering commission-based advice to clients for whom it is the best option.\no      Eliminates the contract requirement for ERISA plans and their participants and beneficiaries. Firms must acknowledge in writing that they, and their advisers, are acting as fiduciaries when providing investment advice to the plan, participant, or beneficiary, but no contract is required.\no      For advice to IRA holders, provides firms flexibility on when to enter into the contract. Some commenters expressed concerns that advisers would need to present a contract as soon as someone walks in the door – before they've even decided whether to hire that adviser. The final exemption makes clear that is not the case. Rather, the contract can be signed at the same time as other account opening documents. However, any advice given before the contract was signed must be covered by the contract and also meet a best interest standard. The exemption also permits existing clients to agree to the new contractual protections by \"negative consent.\"\no      Minimizes number of contractual parties.While the proposal required the firm, advisers, and client to be parties to the contract – which could be difficult in situations like call centers where the customer speaks to multiple advisers at a firm – the final exemption simplifies the contract requirement so that it is only between the firm and the client. There does not have to be a new contract for each interaction with a different employee of the same firm, minimizing the burden on firms.\no      Significantly streamlines and simplifies the required disclosures. Firms commented that the types of disclosure envisioned by the proposed best interest contract exemption, in particular the transaction disclosure requiring 1-, 5-, and 10-year projections, would be difficult and costly. Under the final exemption, the transaction disclosure is simplified to focus on the firm's conflicts of interest, the website disclosure is streamlined but still designed to enable third parties to help customers evaluate different firms' practices that may affect advisers' conflicts of interest, and the annual disclosure is eliminated entirely. Clients can also request more detailed disclosures on costs and fees; that way, they can get the information they need at less cost to firms.\no      Eliminates data retention requirements. Some commenters expressed concerns that, under the proposal, firms would be required to retain detailed data on inflows, outflows, holdings, and returns for retirement investors. Now firms have to retain only the records that show they complied with the law (in this case, the BIC exemption), as they would in other situations.\no      BIC exemption contains a streamlined \"level fee\" provision, which enables advisers and firms that receive only a \"level fee\" in connection with the advice they provide to rely on the exemption without entering into a contract so long as special attention is paid and documentation is kept to show that certain specific recommendations, including a recommendation to rollover assets from an employer plan to an IRA, are in the customer's best interest. Level fee fiduciaries receive the same compensation regardless of the particular investments the client makes (e.g. they may be compensated based on a fixed percentage of assets under management or a fixed dollar fee) and are not compensated based on commissions or transaction fees.\n•      Grandfathered existing investments. Responding to comments, the BIC exemption includes a grandfathering provision that allows for additional compensation from previously acquired assets. The grandfather provision includes recommendations to hold, as well as systematic purchase agreements, but requires that additional advice satisfy basic best interest and reasonable compensation requirements.\n•      Extended implementation time period. Commenters expressed concerns about their ability to comply with the rule in the 8 month implementation period suggested by the proposal. To give firms more time to come into full compliance, the final rule and exemptions adopt a \"phased\" implementation approach. One year after the rule's publication, in April 2017, the broader definition of fiduciary will take effect, but to take advantage of the BIC exemption, firms will only be required to comply with more limited conditions, including acknowledging their fiduciary status, adhering to the best interest standard, and making basic disclosures of conflicts of interest. The other requirements of the exemption will only go into full effect on January 1, 2018. The Department intends to focus during that time on providing compliance assistance to help plan fiduciaries and fiduciary investment advisers make the transition to the new rule, exemptions, and consumer protections for investment advice.", "timestamp": "2016-04-06", "title": "Fact Sheet: Middle Class Economics: Strengthening Retirement Security by Cracking Down on Conflicts of Interest in Retirement Savings"}

{"author": "Ted Cruz", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116629", "text": "Cruz speaks to TIME Magazine for cover story\nHOUSTON, Texas - Presidential candidate Ted Cruz spoke with TIME Magazine reporters before his sweeping Wisconsin primary victory, to discuss his success in uniting all factions of the Republican Party. Cruz says, \"I believe the path to winning the Republican nomination and winning the general election is standing up for hardworking men and women of America who have been left behind by Washington.\" TIME Magazine's Michael Scherer also remarks on the Cruz campaign's strong national organization, \"There is little mystery about who has the best operation for wrangling, recruiting and securing delegates. From Tennessee to Colorado, Cruz's delegate-hunting operation has dominated.\"\nThis morning, Scherer appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe to discuss Cruz's path to the nomination and his broader appeal to the Republican Party, \"When [Cruz] says I am the principled conservative that is true, he is the principled conservative there's no wavering there.\"\nExcerpts below. View full interview transcript here and full article here.\nThe following evening, after changing from his Texas jeans into his election-night suit and powder blue tie, Cruz sat down with TIME for an interview. Sitting on the hotel sofa, the candidate was at ease, relishing what by then was a clear victory. He had coalesced a broad swath of GOP voters for the first time, winning nonevangelicals and evangelicals, young and old, of all ideological bents. \"This race is very simple,\" he said. \"If we unite, we win. If we do not, we lose.\"\nGood politicians know how to recast their message for the moment. The great ones seem to do it without contradiction, alienation or any actual change in position. This is the leap that Cruz is now attempting. He won the Iowa caucuses with devotion and red meat. His rallies began like prayer circles and continued into fury. He would describe the hatred for him from his own party as \"the whole point of the campaign.\" He promised not just to repeal Obamacare but to rescind \"every word\" on Day One. More than unwind the Iran nuclear deal, he vowed to rip it \"to shreds.\" He would not just destroy Islamic extremism, he would find out if \"sand can glow in the dark.\"\nThose bold positions all remain, but their packaging has been muted. The clenched fists are now open arms. \"From the beginning, our objective was to reunite the old Reagan coalition to bring together Republicans and independents and libertarians and Reagan Democrats,\" he said. \"I believe the path to winning the Republican nomination and winning the general election is standing up for hardworking men and women of America who have been left behind by Washington.\" The conservative caterpillar is becoming a general-election butterfly.\n...\nThen there are the gauzy new references in his public remarks. The speech he had prepared for the network cameras the night he won Wisconsin included a quote from former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill about ending the quarrel between past and present to focus instead on the future. He would even quote Democratic President John F. Kennedy, who Cruz has long argued, improbably, would be a conservative Republican if he were alive today. \"We are not here to curse the darkness, but to light the candle that can guide us through that darkness to a safe and sane future,\" Cruz said, repeating Kennedy's words.\nBut it is another President who he said gave him hope his gambit could succeed. \"Throughout the course of this campaign, as others have gotten nasty and gotten personal, have engaged in a war of insults and petty personal attacks, I haven't responded in kind,\" Cruz explained, referencing, among other things, Trump's recent attack on the appearance of his wife Heidi. \"That is very much the model of Ronald Reagan, even when Reagan primaried Gerald Ford in '76.\"\n...\nMeanwhile, there is little mystery about who has the best operation for wrangling, recruiting and securing delegates. From Tennessee to Colorado, Cruz's delegate-hunting operation has dominated, with his aides confident that around 200 Trump delegates will swing to Cruz after the first ballot. In Virginia, where Cruz finished a distant third, the campaign is hustling to install supporters in the state's 13 at-large delegate slots. In Louisiana, Cruz is set to pick up as many as 10 more delegates than Trump, despite losing the Bayou State primary by four points. In a show of organizational muscle, 18 of 25 delegates elected at the North Dakota state convention backed Cruz. In Georgia, where Cruz finished a distant third, his allies have dominated preference polls of the party activists showing up at precinct and county meetings. \"We're going to make sure we get dealt four aces,\" says a member of Cruz's delegate operation. \"You don't just want Cruz supporters.

Bernie Sanders linked her to a trade pact exploited by wealthy individuals and profitable corporations to avoid paying taxes.\nAn investigation by a team of journalists revealed that 214,000 entities throughout the world have used a law firm in Panama to shelter their incomes and profits to avoid paying taxes. The release this week of the documents on offshore financial dealings raised questions over the widespread use of tactics to avoid taxes.\nSanders cited the former secretary of state's support of the trade deal as one reason she should not be the party's nominee for president. \"I don't think you are qualified if you supported the Panama free trade agreement, something I very strongly opposed, which has made it easier for wealthy people and corporations all over the world to avoid paying taxes owed to their countries,\" Sanders told a rally at Temple University in an auditorium packed with nearly 13,000 supporters.\nSanders five years ago led opposition to the Panama trade deal in a Senate floor speech. He predicted that the pact would make it easier for the wealthy and the powerful to stash their cash in Panama to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.\nClinton had opposed the deal in 2008 when she was running against then Sen. Barack Obama. But in an about face, she helped push the agreement through Congress when she was secretary of state.\n\"The American people are sick and tired of establishment politicians who say one thing during a campaign and do the exact opposite the day after the election,\" Sanders said on Tuesday in a prepared statement. As president, Sanders said he would terminate the trade deal and investigate U.S. banks, corporations and wealthy individuals who have been stashing their cash in Panama to avoid taxes.\nSanders came to Pennsylvania fresh off a win Tuesday in Wisconsin, his seventh victory in the past eight caucuses and primaries. A new national poll release Wednesday put him ahead of Clinton by two points and also showed him ahead of Republican front-runner Donald Trump.\nClinton earlier on Wednesday questioned Sanders' qualifications to be president. \"Secretary Clinton appears to be getting a little nervous,\" he shot back. \"She has been saying lately that I am not qualified to be president.\"\nSanders then ticked off his own list of reasons why Clinton isn't qualified to be in the White House.\n\"I don't believe that she is qualified if she is through her super PAC taking tens of millions of dollars in special-interest funds.\n\"I don't think that you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your super PAC.\n\"I don't think you are qualified if you voted for the disastrous war in Iraq.\n\"I don't think you're qualified if you supported almost every disastrous trade agreement.\n\"I don't think you are qualified if you supported the Panama free trade agreement, something I very strongly opposed, which has gave the green light to wealthy people and corporations all over the world to avoid paying taxes owed to their countries.\"", "timestamp": "2016-04-07", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Links Clinton to Panama Papers Scandal"}

Bernie Sanders on Thursday called on Verizon to negotiate a fair contract with workers in the region and addressed the devastation unfettered free trade has brought to the state.\n\"Verizon wants to take American jobs – call center jobs – out of this country and bring them abroad where people will be paid pennies an hour. That is unacceptable,\" said Sanders, who was flanked by members of the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. \"We are going to have to deal with this corporate greed, which is more concerned with compensation packages for CEOs than about the needs of hard working people who want nothing more than to be able to live in dignity and security and bring their kids up in a decent way.\"\nBoth CWA and the IBEW are locked in contract negotiations with Verizon. The company, which books profits of over $1 billion a month, is demanding that workers take pay cuts and reduce health benefits or see their jobs shipped overseas.\nUnfortunately, that choice is familiar for too many workers in Pennsylvania.\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement cost 850,000 good-paying jobs in the United States, including 26,300 in Pennsylvania. Normalized trade relations with China led to the loss of 3.2 million jobs including 122,600 in Pennsylvania. Sanders opposed both agreements while Secretary Clinton supported them.\nDuring the news conference, Sanders cited examples of how bad trade deals have hurt Pennsylvania. In 2013, General Electric announced that it would eliminate 950 jobs at its Pennsylvania locomotive plant in Erie moving many of these jobs to Mexico.\nAllegheny Technologies shut down two steel plants in western Pennsylvania last year, laying off 600 workers due to a surge in cheap imports from China.\nHershey in 2009 shut down its York Peppermint Patties plant in Reading. Three-hundred jobs were lost when the plant was moved to Monterrey, Mexico, where workers are paid a fraction of what they were paid in Pennsylvania.\nSony closed the last television manufacturing plant in the United States in 2008 when it closed a Westmoreland, Pennsylvania, plant that employed 560 workers and moved the plant to Baja, Mexico. Sanders has a consistent record in Congress fighting job-killing trade deals.\nIn Congress, he has led opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal that Clinton, as secretary of state, called the \"gold standard\" for trade agreements.\nClinton recently signaled that she might seek modifications in the pact, but Sanders has said that's not enough. He's pledged to rewrite the worst trade deals of the last 30 years, including NAFTA. Sanders will also impose countervailing tariffs on imports from China and Japan until they stop dumping steel into the United States and stop manipulating their currencies.\nPennsylvania voters go to the polls on April 26 to decide how the state will allocate its 189 pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention this summer in Philadelphia.", "timestamp": "2016-04-07", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Stands with Verizon Workers"}

I canvassed for John F. Kennedy before I was old enough to vote for him. That was when the voting age was 21. Then, in 1972, I did a concert for McGovern. And in 1984 I got involved with the Gary Hart campaign in New Hampshire. I still have some really good friends from that—Senator Jeanne Shaheen ran his campaign.

It's the landscape and the people and just everything. And I became involved with an environmental project that would protect the Northern Rockies ecosystem. It has what are called wildlife corridors, where birds can migrate and so on. Right now, they're being cut down by the timber industry, and these forests are all going away. It's contributing to climate change, and that affects people everywhere. I've been involved in that for the last 25 years.\nAnd what inspired you to support Hillary?\nI support Hillary because she will support the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and make sure it can continue to do the work that it was intended to do. That's a very big issue.\nThe other thing is the fact that she understands the big picture. She doesn't just see things as this issue isolated, or that issue isolated. For example, she sees the intersection between climate change, the environment, and the economy. She understands that creating jobs in renewable energy in the United States would not only help combat climate change, it would create jobs—and those jobs would not be outsourceable. Her understanding of the big picture is the single greatest advantage she has over any candidate running.\nWhat kind of president do you think Hillary would be?\nWhen she represented New York, she represented everyone in New York. If she is fortunate enough to be elected president—if we are fortunate enough to have her be elected—she will represent everyone in America.\nYou've been involved in your fair share of elections over the years, and you've been following this one closely. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing?\nI will say that there is a dynamic going on in the Republican Party that is outside of my radar screen. I don't understand how people can be campaigning about things that are so low on the spectrum of intellect, of understanding, of bringing people together, of seeing the big picture of what would really be good for the world.\nHillary understands that we are interconnected with the rest of the world, so anything you do affects people worldwide. And certainly she would represent the people of the United States first and foremost, but she is also thinking about how to integrate us into the rest of the world in a manner that acknowledges our commonality rather than our differences.\nOf course, there are many countries that are not as easily reasoned with, just as there are many Republican candidates for president that are not as easily reasoned with. But I think it's so important to have a leader for our country who gets the need for inclusivity and working together. I think people who think about limited issues, who don't see the interconnectedness the way she does, are missing something crucial.\nWhat about on the Democratic side?\nAs for the people who support Bernie Sanders: I get them. When I have discussions with friends who are Bernie supporters, it's always respectful. We really do want the same things. But they say, \"I think Bernie is the way to get there.\" And I say, \"Where's his plan?\" I have no problem with the idea of free college, but I don't see how that happens. I do have a problem, however, with starting all over on universal health care—and I wish we had universal health care! But I think we can get to it by building on Obamacare, and I love that that's Hillary's approach.\nShe wrote a book called Hard Choices. Boy, if I were in her position, I would find her choices that she had to deal with very hard. I come from an extremely liberal, progressive point of view. I was that way when I was young—and I still am that way. I think Hillary is in the same place. We are called upon to make hard choices all the time.\nWhat's one thing you wish people knew about Hillary?\nWe hear from people, quote: \"I don't know if she's trustworthy.\" Let me answer that by saying that her opponents, and people who are scared of her politically, have spent millions of dollars throwing mud at her. They do that because they hope some of it will stick. If you think she's untrustworthy, some of it has stuck! And I'm here to tell you that I know her, and I trust her to lead our country to the best possible place it can be. To help you achieve your dreams. To help us achieve our goals. To make a better world for my children and grandchildren and your grandchildren, if you're reading this.", "timestamp": "2016-04-07", "title": "Press Release - What Carole King Wishes You Knew About Hillary Clinton and This Election"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117078", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Chicago, Illinois\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n1:04 P.M. EDT\nMR. SCHULTZ: Welcome aboard, everyone, to Air Force One en route to the University of Chicago Law School, where President Obama taught constitutional law for over a decade, where he'll participate in a discussion on the Supreme Court and the integrity of our judicial system. The President is very much looking forward to visiting the institution that helped shape his dedication to the rule of law, the role of the presidency, and his fidelity to the United States Constitution.\nThere he'll be reunited with his former colleague, Professor David Strauss, and engage directly with the audience of students, faculty and a few of his former law students. The President will discuss today how he fulfilled his constitutional responsibility and presented the American people with the exceptional nominee for our nation's highest court.\nBoth the President and Chief Judge Garland call Chicago their hometown. Chief Judge Garland grew up in Chicago, specifically in Lincolnwood, and his parents were deeply involved in the community, with his mother serving as a volunteer and his dad running a small business from their basement. This impressed upon Merrick Garland the importance of working hard, dealing fairly in service to the community.\nThe President this afternoon will continue making the case for why Chief Judge Garland and why the American people deserve for the Senate to fulfill their own constitutional responsibility to give this eminently qualified nominee a fair hearing and an up or down vote. For us, this is bigger than party or politics. This is about democracy and the institution to which Justice Scalia dedicated his professional life.\nWith that, I'm happy to take your questions.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: Senator Dick Durbin, *Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Representative Mike Quigley are aboard Air Force One and will be with us at the University of Chicago.\nQ: Was Senator Kirk invited?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes.\nQ: And do you know why he didn't come?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't. You should check with his office.\nQ: There's reporting that the White House is declining to offer public support, as they say, for draft legislation that would empower judges to require technology companies like Apple to help law enforcement crack encrypted data. Can you tell me why?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I saw that report, and I don't know what it's based on, because as I understand it, this is legislation that's not even introduced yet. Our position on encryption is well-known. We support strong encryption. We believe it is a key tool for cybersecurity, for innovation, and to protect people's privacy. So the President has said before that there's no scenario in which we don't want really strong encryption. Now, at the same time, we do understand we want to make sure that we don't allow terrorists a safe haven to operate in cyberspace. So that's why we will continue to engage with the private sector to discuss the national security and public safety challenges we face with the use of encryption.\nAs it pertains to this particular piece of legislation, I'm sure we will take a look at what they're proposing and be in touch.\nQ: I think the report actually says you've already offered some kind of comment on it. You're not going to necessarily publicly, but that you have seen a draft. Has the White House seen a draft that you know of?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't know the precise granularity of our exchanges with those offices, but I can tell you that this remains a priority for the President. We'll absolutely be in touch with those offices. But the idea that we're going to withhold support for a bill that's not introduced yet isn't accurate.\nQ: Isn't it the kind of thing, though, given the fact that you've backed DOJ in their effort against Apple, would this kind of thing, if you codified it in legislation, would it make it easier if it's already in legislation and it's law?\nMR. SCHULTZ: We're always willing to work with members of Congress on issues like this. We believe that this issue is complicated, and that's why a national dialogue to help the American people understand it is important. So the President has said there's benefit to a national dialogue and one that is not just specific to the encryption issue but a broader discussion of the issues related to terrorist use of social media and other communications.\nAs you guys have often reported, the President has engaged with the private sector on this. So have top administration officials, because we believe it's important. It's also a complicated piece of business. Josh likes to draw the analogy to child pornography. That was also complicated with sort of legal and privacy concerns, as well as business interests all at stake. And we were able to work with all of those different entities and components to come up with some solution that achieved all of our goals.\nQ: Last one. Would you support a law that would actually buttress that kind of effort when it comes to things like San Bernardino?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, again, we're happy to take a look at any legislation that's being proposed. As you know, the President is a strong proponent of encryption. He believes that's important for not only cybersecurity, protecting people's privacy, but also for the heart of innovation in our country.\nQ: What is the President expecting in terms of an outcome from this appearance today at the University of Chicago to continue making the case, as you said, for Judge Garland's nomination?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think today is going to be an opportunity to have a discussion about the importance of rule of law in our country and I think you can expect the President to make that case. This will be a -- the President will have opening remarks, then he'll have a conversation with Professor Strauss, who, himself, has argued 18 times in front of the United States Supreme Court. And then they're going to open it up for questions with the audience.\nI think you can expect the President to draw on his experience at the University of Chicago Law School and talk about not only fidelity to the rule of law but the importance of having each branch of government functioning. This is something that's important for the President, presumably important to many people, but it was something that was expressly articulated by President Reagan when there was a vacancy in the Supreme Court in the final year of his presidency. He said that every day that goes by without the Supreme Court having a fully staffed bench impairs their ability to do the important work that they have in front of them.\nQ: Can you also tell us why the President has his daughter with him today?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Darlene, on these trips, the President is sometimes fortunate to have his family accompany him. Malia is joining the President for this trip to Chicago and then she'll be with him for a few days in California. But I wouldn't expect her to have any public events or any public schedule.\nQ: Eric, just to follow up on Darlene's point, in terms of the audience that the President is speaking to today, can you talk a little about potentially which constituency -- obviously there are plenty of people who, right now, support this nomination. There are many people who are adamantly against it. So who are those people who he's hoping to reach with this discussion?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. Well, I think this will be a broad discussion. And if you take a look at people who believe that this seat should be filled and confirmed consistent with past precedent, that's a belief that's not just enjoyed by this President, but is actually a widespread belief. If you look at public opinion polls, many of which have been sponsored by your news organizations, if you look at editorial boards from across the country -- I think we're up to about 300 editorial boards -- and newspapers that aren't necessarily always inclined to support this President -- and if you look at what the Constitution says, the President believes that this is a responsibility not only of him to put forward a highly qualified nominee, but also of the United States Senate to confirm that individual.\nSo that's where our focus is. Obviously this is in the hands of the United States Senate right now. And that's why you've seen us take the process of Senate confirmation very seriously. And if you recall, in the hours of Justice Scalia's untimely passing, Republicans announced they would refuse to consider any of President Obama's nominees to the Supreme Court, in fact calling on us to not even nominate someone. We believe that position was manifestly untenable.\nAnd they also argued that they wouldn't meet with any nominee that we put forward. Fast-forward a few weeks -- a few months now -- the President put forward a highly qualified nominee, a nominee who even Republicans admit is a consensus nominee, a nominee who enjoys the support of Republicans like Miguel Estrada, Ken Starr, Michael Chertoff, Alberto Gonzalez. This nominee is someone who has been having private meetings with United States senators, both Democrats and Republicans. Those meetings I can tell you have been thoughtful, have been substantive, have been probing.\nAnd our positon is the following, which is if the senators themselves are going to be in a position to ask questions of our nominee behind close doors and in a private setting, why can't we do that in public? Why can't Chief Judge Garland have the opportunity to answer these questions under oath, on camera, in the public in a setting that is normally called a hearing?\nQ: What sort of a message does it send, though, to go to a state where there's a competitive Senate election and where you have one of your few Republican allies that this is his home state, the day after endorsing his opponent in that race?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. Well, the reason the President is going to the University of Chicago is he taught there for over a decade, so he's got deep roots not only in the Chicago area, obviously, but also at that institution. This is an institution that really shaped the President's views on the importance of rule of law in our country and the fidelity to the Constitution.\nAs I also mentioned, Chief Judge Garland has roots in Chicago, too. So we thought this would be an apt place to have this discussion.\nQ: Was there any consideration of not doing the endorsement of Tammy Duckworth within 24 hours of the trip to Chicago?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The President did decide to endorse Congresswoman Duckworth. He believes she is eminently qualified for the United States Senate. She's a war hero. She's someone who has served in this administration, standing up for veterans. She's someone who served the people of Illinois in the United States Congress. He's proud to support her.\nQ: And you don't think it says anything to the other Republicans who are deciding what they're going to do about Garland or that you want to switch over to your side?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The message I think that sends is just do your job. We're not asking for any Senate Republicans to do anything extraordinary, anything creative. There's a lot of times where Congress has to face complex, complicated issues -- you might call encryption one of them. This one is fairly simple. This is an elementary responsibility for them to advise and consent on the President's judicial nominations.\nQ: Has he been back to the University of Chicago Law School since he was a professor there?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I did a little bit of digging on this. The President has not been back to the University of Chicago since becoming President. I cannot account for any interim years since leaving the law school and getting to the White House. But I can also tell you this is the 33rd trip to Illinois by the President since getting into the White House.\nQ: Can I ask you one other on something else? Does President Obama think Hillary Clinton is qualified to be President?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The President has said that Secretary Clinton comes to this race with more experience than any other non-Vice President in recent campaign history. The President was fortunate to have Secretary Clinton serve as his Secretary of State for four years, when they worked together on some of the world's most complicated and complex issues. And he's proud of that service.\nQ: And what does he make of Bernie Sanders saying that the same super PAC that supported President Obama in 2012 is supporting Hillary Clinton now is a disqualification for her being President?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have a conversation with the President to read out to you on that. I know that this is a heated campaign season, and campaigns are going to trade barbs back and forth. And the good news for all of you is those campaigns have highly paid communication professionals who would be happy to answer your question.\nQ: The President doesn't think that using a super PAC disqualified him from being President?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I haven't talked to the President about it.\nQ: So to get us to inversions. The administration had made clear that there would be more inversions rules coming, but the fact that they came on Monday was a big surprise to most everybody, and the markets certainly reacted as such. So I'm curious, why that timing and why the surprise element, given the pains that this administration and the President often takes to avoid market surprises?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Angela, I don't have details of how Treasury went about this process. All I can tell you is this, as you point out, was the third step they've taken to try and curb this unpatriotic process. And this began with the President's announcement back in 2014 announcing that he wanted to take on this idea that some large corporate interests could shirk their responsibility to pay taxes to pay their fair share by renouncing their American citizenship. The President believes that's an unfair practice and it's un-American. And so that's why the Treasury has taken some significant steps both in the intervening time, but, as you point out, in recent days to help discourage this action.\nQ: But was the surprise element intended?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I can't speak to if others found this surprising. As you know, this has been a priority for this President. And I know the Treasury Department has been dogged in their process of putting this together. This is a complicated piece of business, and the Treasury Department wanted to make sure they got it right.\nQ: How quickly should we expect more rules on inversions?\nMR. SCHULTZ: You should check with the Treasury Department. I know that if they're working on any future actions, the most impactful thing we could do would be if Congress took some action here. Unfortunately, they've shown -- unfortunately, Congress has not shown a backbone to stand up to large corporate interests that choose to renounce their American citizenship in exchange for tax benefits.\nThe President feels very strongly we should close those loopholes. That's why the President directed his Treasury Department to do what they could. But that's also why the President wants to see Congress step up to the plate and take some action here.\nQ: And can you say how involved was the President in the inversions rule that Treasury just came out with? Like was it something where he was regularly kept up to date by Treasury on how things were proceeding? Or was it something where he really got into the weeds on it, as he sometimes does in issues that concern hi, or that he's particularly interested in?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Roberta, as with all tax guidance or regulation, this is an action taken by Treasury and the IRS. I can tell you that Treasury kept the White House up to date as their process proceeded. And ultimately, the President was informed of Treasury's final decision in the days leading up to the announcement. But, yes, this is absolutely a priority of this President, and that's why he called for executive actions a few years ago.\nQ: In other financial news, Puerto Rico has decided to enact a debt moratorium. How does that -- or does it complicate the efforts of Washington to right Puerto Rico's financials?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Angela, we continue to closely monitor the situation in Puerto Rico and the Treasury Department is in regular contact with their government. We know that the commonwealth is in crisis and urgently needs the ability to restructure its financial liabilities, along with independent oversight that respects the commonwealth's governance. So that's why we've called on Congress to provide Puerto Rico with tools to achieve a lasting, workable solution and create a path to recovery for the 3.5 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico. We have been encouraged by the bipartisan progress that's being made on the Hill right now. We've expressed some concerns with the legislation as it currently lays out, but our work on that continues in earnest.\nQ: But will the action by Puerto Rico change anything that Washington is doing now that it appears there may actually be legislation?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think the process of that legislation has been underway for a few weeks now and so we hope that that process remains undeterred.\nQ: Do you care to respond to the President of Russia saying the release of the Panama Papers was some sort of U.S.-driven plot to weaken Russia?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I have no idea what the President of Russia is basing that on.\nQ: Does he need anything? (Laughter.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: I can only speak for my President, and when the President speaks on highly charged topics, it's always grounded in facts.\nQ: Did the U.S. have any inkling that this document dump was coming, or that these reports were about to pop, or anything of that nature?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Darlene, I can't account for the entire enterprise of the United States government. I can tell you that I did not.\nQ: The President and this White House has had a pretty good working relationship with CEOs of big companies, the kinds of companies that would be concerned by this move. And I'm wondering what kind of response the White House has had from its allies in the business community since Treasury came out with its decision? And do you see this sort of harming the working relationship that the President has with business in the last months of his time in office?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Roberta, I want to quibble with one premise of your question, which is we think most American businesses want to pay their fair share. Most American businesses are headed by CEOs who believe that a tax system -- I'm sorry -- that they want to pay their fair share. And that's why the President believes that under current rules with these loopholes, those who are trying to do the right thing are penalized because there are currently loopholes available to those who are wishing to skirt tax law by renouncing their citizenship and moving their citizenship on paper overseas.\nSo the President actually believes that he wants to level the playing field so that all corporations are playing by the same rules.\nQ: Do you expect him today at all to address his -- Josh said that he's had regrets over his decision to participate in the filibuster in 2006 against Alito. Do you expect him to address that today?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Look, he'll have -- the President will have a chance to make brief remarks at the top, and then there will be a question-and-answer period with Professor Strauss, President Obama's former colleague. And then there will be an open Q&A with the audience. So I'm not sure what those questions will be.\nQ: Can that include us?\nMR. SCHULTZ: What's that?\nQ: Can that include us as the audience?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Probably not today. But I did want to point out that on Justice Alito, by the way, is a justice and has been for about 10 years. His confirmation battle took 82 days. So the average for a Supreme Court justice is about 67 days from confirmation -- I'm going to try that again -- nomination to confirmation. Sam Alito's took 82 days. So we expect the Senate to move with expediency, consistent with all of that precedent.\nQ: Can you speak on how the audience was selected beyond obviously they're former colleagues of his? There are some both 7th Circuit judges and some local jurists. How were those student selected? Can you just shed any light on that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I can tell you that we worked closely with the University of Chicago Law School primarily to put this audience together. There will be current students representing all three years of law school. There will be faculty and there will be members of the sort of greater University of Chicago Law School community. So that includes some alumni, and that includes important partners they have in the greater Chicago community.\nI can also tell you we expect some family members of Chief Judge Garland to join us, as well as some of their family friends.\nQ: Do you know who among his family?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I know that his sister Jill will be joining us, among others.\nQ: One more to circle back on the President's daughter. You said she's not going to have any public events, and we wouldn't expect her to have any public events. But you speak for the President, so what is the reason that he brought her along today? Does he want her to see where he used to teach? Is there something he wants to impart to her? She's in the middle of her own college process. Is this part of that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, the President is fortunate enough to sometime have members of his family travel with him. This is one of those trips. His daughter is going to join him on this travel to Chicago and then join us all the way to California. I wouldn't expect any public events or any public schedule she has beyond that.\nQ: Thanks.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you, guys.\nEND 1:29 P.M.

You're using it in your classrooms. You're eating healthier school lunches. And it's having a good impact on your education and on your overall health.\nAnd that was really the point, one of the reasons why I planted the first White House Kitchen Garden at the White House almost eight years ago. And Tuesday, we did our last planting before my husband and I, we leave the White House. So I was a little sad, but wanted to celebrate by doing what we're calling an American Garden Tour. So I'm traveling all around the county and highlighting all the great work that's been done over the last seven or eight years in community gardens, in school gardens. Because since we planted our garden, a lot of people across the country have done the same things, and so there are all these wonderful stories all over the country.\nBurke County, right here, is a wonderful example of what schools are doing in rural communities and how it's benefitting. And Al and I are going to hop back on my plane, and we're flying to Newark, New Jersey, in a couple of hours, and we're going to highlight what's going on in an urban-garden school.

You can even garden in space, because on Friday, I think, they're going to blast off some seeds to the International Space Station, where they're going to grow cabbage and some of the stuff that we're growing in the White House Kitchen Garden, just to prove that you can garden anywhere.\nSo I just want to say I'm proud of you all for the work that you do, because I know that a lot of what you do is student-initiated. So I'm looking forward to hearing from you guys what you've learned, what you're doing, and then, hopefully, helping you plant your garden for this year.

Strauss. Well, Mr. President, this is a tremendous honor for the University and the law school. Welcome back.\nThe President. It is good to be back. It is good to be back. I—as some of you may know, I actually spent 10 years teaching classes and seminars here, and it was really fun. [Laughter] And I missed it. And I thought, well, why don't I come back and say hi to everybody.\nAnd so I—there are a couple of people I want to acknowledge because they helped to facilitate this. First of all, I want to thank Dean Miles for closing down the school, I guess, for a day. Thank you. Special acknowledgements for Geoff Stone and Doug Baird, who were great friends when I was teaching here and were partly responsible for having me actually take on some responsibility straight out of law school to mold the minds of students who were just barely younger than me. I can—I know that because I—some of them I saw and they all have gray hair now—[laughter]—which is a little troubling.\nWe've got a terrific congressional delegation who's here, and I just want to acknowledge them. First of all, your outstanding senior Senator from the great State of Illinois, Dick Durbin is here. And we've got Congressman Bobby Rush, Congressman Danny Davis, Congressman Bill Foster, and Congressman Mike Quigley. We also have Lisa Madigan, the attorney general of Illinois and my former seatmate in Springfield when we were both in the State Senate together, and is doing a terrific job.\nAnd I want to thank David, who I was joking before we came out, is one of the country's foremost constitutional experts and a nice guy. [Laughter] And you guys are lucky to have him. In fact, when I was teaching here, I think that I stole his Con Law class for a while, and he graciously gave it up because despite the privilege of grading 60 or 70 bluebooks—[laughter]—he apparently thought it was important for me to have that privilege as well.\nSo, last thing I'll say by way of introduction: I had a chance to talk to some young people over in the overflow room, mostly students, and I just said to them that having now been in politics for quite some time, seeing what lawyers are capable of doing every single day, working on a whole range of issues that are of huge importance to our democracy and to our society, I hope that all the students here are excited about the incredible changes and good that you are going to be able to do when you get out of here.\nI know that sometimes the news feeds cynicism and democracy at this moment seems particularly frustrating. But each and every day, I see lawyers not that much older than you who are helping young people get an education, are making sure that consumers are protected, are helping to keep America safe, are ensuring that our health care system works for everybody, are helping to preserve the planet and fight against climate change. It is remarkable what you can do with your talents. And it doesn't always get a lot of publicity, but you can make a really meaningful difference.\nSo one of the reasons I wanted to come back is to recruit you—[laughter]—to stay engaged, get involved, make a difference. It doesn't mean you have to run for office. It doesn't mean you even have to work for government. There are a lot of ways of serving. But I do hope that one of the things that you will take away from our discussion today and your extraordinary education here at the University of Chicago is the incredible high that you can get from serving this country.\nSo with that, what do you want to talk about, David? [Laughter]\nSupreme Court Nominee Merrick B. Garland/Supreme Court Nomination Process\nMr. Strauss. Well, let me start back when you were here as a teacher. I know you taught Constitutional Law, so you were thinking about the Supreme Court and thinking about the Justices and what would make someone a—what made someone a great Justice or a successful Justice. But you're in a different spot now.\nThe President. Mm-hmm. [Laughter]\nMr. Strauss. Has your thinking changed?\nThe President. Surprisingly, not as much as you would have expected. Obviously, we're having a substantial argument in Washington right now about not just a particular judge, but also about the process of appointing judges to the Federal courts and appointing nominees to the Supreme Court.\nAnd to get this out of the way, Merrick Garland is an extraordinary jurist who is indisputably qualified to serve on the highest court of the land. And nobody really argues otherwise. I mean, I just want to be clear here. If the question is qualifications and excellence, it is uniformly viewed by not just Democrats, but also Republicans—those who have served him, lawyers, judges, legal scholars, members of the current Supreme Court—that he is as good of a judge as we have in this country right now; that he's fair, he's smart, he's objective. He's a consensus builder. He shows judicial restraint. He's appreciative of the unique role of the Court, but also respectful of the role of the other branches of government.\nSo no one has plausibly made an argument that this is not the kind of person we'd want on the Supreme Court. The question then becomes, why is it so hard for the guy just to get a hearing and a vote?\nAnd this speaks to what's happened, generally, when it comes to the process of appointing Federal judges. It used to be that people read the Constitution and Article II powers fairly straightforwardly. It says the President shall make these nominations with the advice and consent of the Senate. And unless there was some sort of real problem with that judge's character or qualifications, it was fairly routine at every level—both at the district court level, the appellate court level, and the Supreme Court—that the person would be confirmed in short order. There would be a hearing. People would ask the potential judge a question or 2 or 5 or 10. There would be questionnaires. And once they had satisfactorily performed that process, then the Senate would vote.\nAnd it was presumed—it was understood—that just as the President had a constitutional duty to make the appointment that the Senate had a constitutional duty to at least make a determination as to whether this person should be on the bench.\nWhat has been unique in this process has been the growing attitude inside of the Senate that every nomination, no matter how well qualified a judge is, is a subject of contention. In some cases, it's simply because one party or the other wants to gum up the works and so they will drag out confirmations longer and longer. Even if, ultimately, the judge gets confirmed by voice vote, by unanimous consent in the Senate, they'll drag it out for 2 or 3 months, because if you're bogged down with judges, then it means other business can't be done. So sometimes, it's just strategic.\nIn other cases, the view has been that despite all the talk about people wanting objective judges who are just calling balls and strikes and don't bring any views to bear, that there are litmus tests that are applied that prevent a judge from getting a fair vote, even though they're qualified, because they don't meet the particular views of the party that's objecting.\nAnd this problem got bad enough in previous administrations, but came to a head under my administration, in which we had a situation where we were starting to see 6 months pass or 9 months pass before a judge could get a hearing. It was—this was when Democrats were in charge of the Senate, but because of the particular rules of the filibuster that previously had been used for just a few things, but now were routinely deployed on everything, we just couldn't get judges through. And you started seeing a crisis in vacancies across districts and circuits everywhere.\nFinally, the Democrats said, we're ending the ability for Senate Members to filibuster when it comes to district court and appellate court Justices, but we're going to preserve it for the Supreme Court.\nWe now have a situation, after Judge Scalia's passing, in which it's not just that the Republican majority in the Senate intend to vote against a highly qualified judge, we now have a situation where they're saying, we simply will not consider the nomination itself. We're just going to shut down the process. And as a consequence, we have a 4-4 tie in the Supreme Court and potentially at least two Supreme Court terms in which this vacancy will remain.\nThat is unprecedented. Not only are they not willing to hold a vote at this point, they have refused to hold hearings on Judge Garland. And in some cases, Mitch McConnell and others have said, we will not even show the courtesy of meeting with the judge to find out what he thinks. And I think what's important for all of you to understand—because you're going to be not just lawyers appearing in court, potentially, but custodians of our legal system and our democracy—is if you start getting into a situation in which the process of appointing judges is so broken, so partisan that a eminently qualified jurist cannot even get a hearing, then we are going to see the kinds of sharp, partisan polarization that have come to characterize our electoral politics seeping entirely into the judicial system. And the courts will be just an extension of our legislatures and our elections and our politics.\nAnd that erodes the institutional integrity of the judicial branch. At that point, people lose confidence in the ability of the courts to fairly adjudicate cases and controversies. And our democracy can't afford that. Our system is designed to make sure that this branch works. And it requires a broad consensus, even if we don't agree on any particular ruling, that the Court's rulings itself are legitimate and consistent with our democratic design. And that's why this is so important. It's not just a matter of who is occupying that ninth seat in the Supreme Court. It has to do with how we, as a democracy, operate and the particular authority that a court has to bring in order for our democracy to work.\nThat was a really long answer. [Laughter] Others will not be as long. [Laughter]\nSupreme Court Nomination Process/U.S. Political System\nMr. Strauss. Well, let me ask you about that, Mr. President. I mean, how did we get to this point? You hear sometimes that the problem is the Supreme Court has injected itself into political issues, and so of course, it gets enmeshed in politics. But the Supreme Court has been controversial almost from the beginning: from the Jeffersonians' attack on the Marshall Court——\nThe President. Yes.\nMr. Strauss. ——all the way through the \"Impeach Earl Warren\" billboards——\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Strauss. ——in parts of the country in the fifties and sixties. And we haven't had this before.\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Strauss. So what is there—do you have an explanation for what it is that's brought us to this position?\nThe President. I think there are a variety of explanations. First of all, it's important to underscore what you just said. And all of you law students, even if you're not critical legal theorists or what have you—[laughter]—I think, just from reading cases, you will acknowledge that there's politics in legal rulings. There's—when we make decisions about right, wrong, what are the rules governing our society, et cetera, that that's an extension of our broader political and democratic conversation. Nobody is denying that.\nAnd you're right. There have been controversies in the past about how we should decide the balance between liberty and security, about how do we treat minority groups to assure that they are protected from majority rule. How do we make sure that the political process itself has integrity and that our votes count? Those are all issues where passions are real and people have opinions. And there's nothing wrong with that.\nBut I think what changed was when the Congress itself, and the Senate in particular, began to change. I think in some ways the judicial process is a casualty of some broader trends in our democracy. First of all, our politics have become much more polarized. There's been something called the great sorting, right, because of gerrymandering, because of how our media works where folks either watch FOX News or they read the New York Times, but rarely do both. [Laughter] Positions get hardened and reinforced. Partisans are carrying more weight within each party. The notion of a liberal Republican or a conservative Democrat, those things broke down. And so politics itself got more polarized.\nThat then fed into a culture in Congress in which basic comity and habits of courtesy and process and institutional respect for people that you didn't agree with—those things began to break down. The filibuster, as I said, started becoming just standard practice. There's nothing in the Constitution that says every item that comes before the Senate is supposed to get a supermajority. It used to be that the filibuster—it doesn't have a very distinguished history—was used principally for blocking civil rights and antilynching and voting rights legislation. That was bad enough. It then suddenly became the norm for everything as minority parties started to decide that they wanted to block what the majority of Senators were in favor of. And so all of this, I think, contributed to the—a breakdown of the process.\nNow, in fairness, Democrats are not blameless on this. If you talk to Republicans, they'll also point—often point to the Bork nomination as where this all started. And there have been times where Democrats used the filibuster to block what Republican Presidents or conservative legal theorists viewed as eminently qualified jurists. The—I will say that there has not been a circumstance in which a Republican President's appointee did not get a hearing, did not get a vote, and as a general proposition, they have been confirmed even where there have been strong objections.\nSo what you have here is, I think, a circumstance in which those in the Senate have decided that placating our base is more important than upholding their constitutional and institutional roles in our democracy in a way that is dangerous. And there are other examples of it, but this judicial nomination process, I think, has become an extreme example of that.\nThe President's Supreme Court Nominee Selection Criteria/Supreme Court Nominee Merrick B. Garland\nMr. Strauss. Let me take you back a step to how—to your thinking about when you're making an appointment.\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Strauss. And again, I'm going to try to put it in an historical context a little bit. You have Presidents who really set out to reshape the Court. And Franklin Roosevelt may be the clearest example. He was determined to find Justices who would uphold——\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Strauss. ——New Deal legislation. Richard Nixon wanted Justices who would limit the rights of people accused of crimes.\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Strauss. And that's sort of one model.\nAnd then you have Presidents who did not have any particular agenda. And I think President Eisenhower is an example. He appointed three of the great Justices of the 20th century: Chief Justice Warren, Justice Harlan, Justice Brennan. But his appointees came from different backgrounds——\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Strauss. ——no ideology, no identifiable tendency in the way they thought about the Constitution.\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Strauss. So do you see yourself as one of those models or as something different from both?\nThe President. There's no doubt that in making my appointments, the values of the Justice matter to me. And what I mean by that is not how they'd rule on a particular issue. In fact, we're very careful when I interview candidates not to ask them about a particular case or controversy that might make it seem as if I want a particular outcome. But what I've been consistently looking for—and this is what I saw in Justice Sotomayor, what I saw in Justice Kagan—is people who, number one, have intellectual integrity. And what that means is, is that they look at the facts and the law, and even if it's uncomfortable to them, they don't like the outcome, they follow the law, and they recognize that that's their job.\nNumber two, that they bring a humanity to the job. And what I mean by that is that, particularly on the Supreme Court, 9 out of 10 cases—well, certainly in the Federal courts—9 out of 10 cases, you can probably arrive at an outcome just by applying basic tenets of constitutional interpretation. There's not going to be a lot of controversy. The cases that really matter are the ones where there's ambiguity, where there's a lack of clarity, where it requires constitutional principles being applied in a way that is true to precedent, is true to basic legal tenets, but also that understands the unique role of the Court in making sure that people who are locked out of the political process, for example, are not permanently locked out, that they have some recourse; that we have Justices who understand how the world works so that they are not entirely blind to the history of racial discrimination or gender discrimination or how money operates in our world.\nNot because that necessarily leads them to rule on a particular issue, but because it means that when they're looking at a tough case in which statute or the Constitution does not provide a—an immediate, ready answer, that they can apply judgment, grounded in how we actually live and the ideals and principles that have made this such an extraordinary country. I want them to have lived a little and be able to see the wide spectrum of people that they're going to be wielding this enormous power over.\nAnd so a lot of times, when I talk to the candidates for the judiciary, I spend time asking about their families and them growing up and what were formative experiences in their minds. And in some ways, that reveals more than anything.\nAnd then, part of the reason that I think that Merrick Garland would be such an extraordinary judge is not just because he's already been an extraordinary judge, but I think about his life story. And I mentioned this in the introduction: When he was a high school kid, as class valedictorian, and he's got a student speaking ahead of him who lambasts the Vietnam war, and parents are trying to unplug the guy's mike, and Merrick comes in and, not because he necessarily agrees with the student, but impromptu, provides a vigorous defense of free speech. As a 17 or 18-year-old kid, that tells me about—something about him. It gives me confidence that this is somebody who's thought about what our core values and ethics are as a society.\nWhen you hear about the work he did in the Oklahoma City bombing, and he's presiding over the investigation at the Justice Department, and the fact that he was meticulous in how he conducted that investigation and didn't cut corners, even though, in the wake of those kinds of terrorist attacks, oftentimes, it's convenient, because people aren't going to call you on it, to cut corners, and at the same time, how he kept the program mourning the deceased from the memorial because he knew that there—each one of those people who had been killed and each one of those families had been affected in such profound ways—that tells me something about who he is.\nAnd that, as much as anything, I think, is going to give me confidence that that's the kind of person where, if I'm before a judge, I want to make sure that I've got somebody who's got—who's wise and who cares about people and is not arbitrary and can provide confidence to the justice system. And I also think part of the reason I thought Merrick was ideal now is precisely because of all the polarization we were talking about earlier. What a good moment for us to have somebody who is respected by both sides and who Chief Justice Roberts served with on the appellate court and befriended and consistently said—despite being on the opposite ends of a bunch of decisions—said this is somebody who, if he says you're wrong, you've got to think long and hard about it.\nHe embodies and models what it is that we want to see in our jurisprudence.\nRole of the Supreme Court Mr. Strauss. So let me sort of pick up on that. I mean, as you know, some people on the left were disappointed with your choice of Chief Judge Garland. They thought you should have appointed someone who would be more aggressive in moving the Court in a certain direction. And I just—sort of, I guess what I want to say is, those of us who knew you back then could have said you shouldn't be surprised, because if I remember correctly—and correct me if I don't—when you were teaching Constitutional Law, there are people in that line of work who hold up the Warren Court as the model and say the Court's job is to be really on the front lines of attacking society's problems.\nThe President. Right.\nMr. Strauss. And you were, if I remember correctly, you were skeptical of that when you were a law professor. So am I right in remembering that, and has the skepticism carried over?\nThe President. No, no, I think you're right about this. It's an adage in Con Law, and you're familiar with this—probably the students are too—that the courts are a terrific shield, but they're not always a very effective sword. And what I mean by that is, is that there have been moments in history—Brown v. Board of Education being the best example and, on the other end of the spectrum, a decision like Dred Scott, which was antithetical to what we'd want to see a court do—there are certain moments where, like in Brown, that the democracy has broken down in a fundamental way. The majority has shut down access for the petitions for redress from a minority group. There are times where an individual who is engaging, let's say, in highly unpopular speech is not going to be able, through the political process, to uphold the values that we, collectively, have decided are pretty important to uphold.\nAnd so, in those circumstances, I have a very progressive view of how the courts should operate. But as I think Judge Garland said, being a Federal judge doesn't mean that you are—you have this broad writ to simply remake society. Ideally, you've got a political process that does that: that we argue about issues and we elect representatives and we get votes and we pass bills and we get a new administration and they overturn stuff that we passed. And it's rough, and it's tumble, and it's not always elegant, but that's the constitutional design. And it has the benefit of making sure that separation of powers and decentralization of power in our society keeps this lumbering ship moving in a pretty good direction.\nAnd so it has—it's been rare—and this is by design—that the Court engages in massive social engineering. Now, I care deeply about—there are a whole range of progressive causes that I will continue to fight for as long as I have a breath. I believe in a society that is doing something about climate change in an aggressive way. I believe in a society that—in which every child is able to get a decent education and opportunity. I believe that everybody should have health care in a society that's wealthy; it's not a privilege, it's a right. I believe that our criminal justice system is flawed in a whole range of ways.\nA couple of weeks ago, or maybe it was last week, I had lunch with a sampling of the people that I've pardoned for nonviolent drug offenses. And I've got a woman sitting next to me who, at a very young age, in her early twenties, was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent drug offense. It's crazy. It makes no sense. It was unjust and counterproductive and leaves huge scars not just in that woman's family and her children, but in our society as a whole.\nSo there are a whole bunch of things I've done as President and I intend to continue to do and to advocate for. Those are not things, though, that typically a Supreme Court Justice is in the position to get done. They don't have taxing power. They don't necessarily have the expertise to be designing programs to get at the things that we care about. And so I have a—I do have a modesty in terms of my expectations for what the Court should do.\nBut I want the Court to do what it should do really well. I want a court that does believe that equality under the law is equality under the law, not just the words, but that it is operationalized, that it's real. I want a court that is treating a poor, indigent criminal defendant the same as a wealthy criminal defendant, and that justice is blind with respect to——\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. I—she agrees with me. [Laughter]\nSo modesty in the scope and the nature of what the law is, but doing really well what the Court is designed to do: that's what I'm looking for in a Justice.\nMr. Strauss. I think we can open it up to questions.\nThe President. Good. Let's open it up to questions. With the—there you go, a little Socratic method here. [Laughter] State the case! [Laughter] No, I'm teasing, I'm teasing. This young lady right here in the green. Yes.\nQ. Hi. So——\nThe President. Do we have a mike? Yes. Let's give them mikes so everybody can hear you. Introduce yourself, by the way.\nCriminal Justice Reform/Opioid Addiction\nQ. Hi.\nThe President. Hi.\nQ. So my name is Amelia.\nThe President. Hey, Amelia.\nQ. I actually had the opportunity to ask you a question when I was 15 years old in New Hampshire.\nThe President. Wow. [Laughter]\nQ. So I'm really happy to——\nThe President. Are you a student here now?\nQ. I am. I'm a 1L.\nThe President. That's very cool. Did I answer your question the last time?\nQ. You did, very well. [Laughter]\nThe President. Thank goodness. All right, what do you got?\nQ. So I'm really happy to hear that you said you were going to continue to push for the issues that you care about, because I, of course, believe that the push for the Supreme Court nomination is incredibly important.\nThe President. Right.\nQ. I'm just a little concerned that other issues could get left behind. One such issue, for example, is criminal justice reform—specifically mass—the problem of mass incarceration. The President. Right.\nQ. So I was wondering if you could speak to what more you'll do in your last 10 months to address this issue.\nThe President. Great. It's a great question. We're in this really interesting moment where generally Congress is thoroughly unproductive—not, by the way, because of the Members of Congress who are here, but—[laughter]—who are all doing great work—[laughter]—but in the aggregate, it's not doing much.\nOne exception has been this growing interest, this movement in criminal justice reform. And it's bipartisan, and it's sincere on the part of all sides on this. And it's an interesting convergence. You have fiscal conservatives who have been seeing how expensive it is to incarcerate people year after year after year and how it's breaking the bank, particularly at the State level, where if you track spending on public education and spending on incarceration over the last 20, 25, 30 years, there is almost a direct line between more people in jail and less support for public universities, for example. So there's a fiscal concern.\nYou've got a libertarian strand of conservatives who really believe, why is it the government's business if somebody is taking—smoking pot, let's say, and why would we want to jail them for 20 years? You've got a very sincere evangelical movement that oftentimes is involved in reentry programs or prison ministries and so have embraced the idea of a second chance.\nAnd so you combine that with law enforcement that I think has begun to recognize that a lot of how we have prosecuted the war on drugs has been unproductive and that recidivism is inevitable if people are getting no skills. They're incarcerated for decades, and then we're just releasing them with no possible support. And then, the long-standing progressive view that a lot of our criminal justice system has been tainted by racial discrimination and class bias. All those things are converging.\nAnd so now we've got some really interesting coalitions. You've got the ACLU and the Koch brothers agreeing on this, which does not happen often. [Laughter] Dick Durbin has been one of the key leaders in the Senate in shaping a criminal justice reform bill that has a real chance of passage. And the—I think it's really important to understand the nominations process with Judge Garland is not holding back our ability to move forward.\nI mean, it would be one thing if Mitch McConnell was saying, man, that's going to take so long to schedule all the hearings and the votes, and we won't have time because we're just so busy—[laughter]—that we can't then do criminal justice instead. But since there has been a spike in the number of days off in this Congress, and typically, a judicial confirmation takes less than 3 months from the time that person is nominated—Judge Alito, for example, took 82 days—this is something that shouldn't prevent us from getting done the criminal justice issues.\nI think what's been tougher is just managing the traditional politics around being soft on crime versus being tough on crime. And right now, because crime rates—sadly, except for in certain neighborhoods in Chicago and a few other cities—have been going down in ways that are remarkable and nobody can fully explain, there is less profit in saying I'm going to be tough on crime.\nBut there is always a hesitance on the part of legislators, because very rarely is a politician punished for having been too tough on crime and sentencing. But occasionally, à la Willie Horton, they feel that a vote that can be perceived as lenient might come back to bite them. The good news is, so far at least, people have stuck with it. And I'm modestly optimistic that we can get something done this year. It won't solve the problem of mass incarceration, because that was a process that took 20, 30 years to get to where we are now, where we account for 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners, so it's going to take some time to reverse. But the legislation that's pending right now provides meaningful reductions in the standards for sentencing around nonviolent drug crimes. It does some very important work in terms of reentry, diversion programs. It breaks this psychology that we just have to lock people up in order to keep ourselves safe.\nOne last element to this that has been interesting is the opioids crisis that some of you may have read about. Right now painkillers—overdoses of people taking painkillers kills more people than traffic accidents. I mean, it's a remarkable statistic. There has been this huge spike in painkiller addiction, and it—which is then leading to heroin addiction, because oftentimes heroin is cheaper than painkillers. And four out of five people who get addicted to heroin start their addiction with OxyContin or some other painkiller addiction. And unlike crack, it's not just affecting inner-city African American or Latino communities. It's widespread. It's pervasive. It's seeping into rural areas. And it's a tragic issue that we are really spending a lot of time focused on.\nBut what's interesting is, is that the politics of this changes a little bit where when elected officials see kids who are like their kids getting hooked and going through these terrible things, there's been a greater predisposition to think of this as a public health issue rather than a criminal justice and incarceration issue.\nAnd that's—I'm just being blunt—that's the truth. But it actually has had an impact in terms of an openness, I think, to reexamining some of our drug laws.\nGood question. I'm sure your question 8 years ago was really good too. [Laughter]\nAll right, I'm going to go boy, girl, boy, girl—[laughter]—just to make sure this is fair. We monitor these things. [Laughter] Yes, gentleman right here, in the tie. You. Yes, you look sharp. [Laughter] Do you wear a tie every day to class or—[laughter]?\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Oh. That's good, man.\nDemocratic Party/U.S. Political System\nQ. I'm Jimmy. I'm also a 1L. I've never asked you a question before. [Laughter]\nThe President. Okay.\nQ. So this might not go very well. [Laughter] But I've written it down so, hopefully, I can read. Mr. President, we are currently in the midst of a polarizing, political election cycle dividing both major parties along populist and establishment fault lines. Do you anticipate this divergence within the Democratic Party widening to the extent we saw with the Tea Party's emergence within the ranks of the Republican Party? And if not, what do you worry about for the future of the Democratic Party?\nThe President. Short answer is, no, I don't. The cleavages inside the Democratic Party are not comparable to what we're seeing in the Republican Party right now. The argument inside the Democratic Party is a little bit more about means, less about ends. If you look at our two Democratic candidates, they believe that everybody should get health care. They believe that every child should get a good education. They believe that climate change is real and that we should do something about it. They believe in equality for the LGBT community. Right? I mean, if you go through the list, there's not a huge divergence there.\nI think that in the Democratic Party, there is a populist impulse that grows out of what I also think has happened for folks who are voting in the Republican primary, this frustration in the wake of the financial crisis and the bottom falling out for people who lost their jobs or lost their homes or lost their pensions; that the world is moving fast, the ground is not firm under their feet. And even before that crisis, wages and incomes were not going up at the same pace as productivity, corporate profits, and so forth. And so there is a sense, the game is rigged. And we have to more fundamentally change that game, that system, whether it's Wall Street or how Washington operates or what have you.\nSome of that impulse is healthy. I mean, I think I—you want people to be asking hard questions about injustice economically and the way that insiders in the political process may not fully represent the interest of everyone.\nThe danger, whether for Democrats or Republicans, is in a closed-loop system where everybody is just listening to the people who agree with them, that you start thinking the way to get to where I want to go is to simply be as uncompromising as possible and hold the line and not pay attention or listen to what the other side has to say. And if I—and that is sort of a Tea Party mentality. And that anybody who suggests, well, there's another point of view or there's a whole half of the country that completely disagrees with us that we have to work with, well, then you must be a sellout, or you must be corrupted, or you must be on the take, or what have you.\nAnd that is not, I think, useful. And the reason—it's not to say that there isn't corruption, that there isn't compromise, or people compromising principles for less-than-noble means, et cetera. Those things happen, and they should be called out.\nBut a lot of the reason why a lot of Democrats who supported me and still support me got frustrated is because a bunch of the country doesn't agree with me or them, and they have votes too, and they elect Members of Congress. And that's how our democracy works. It's not a situation, if you don't get everything you want, it's not always because the person you elected sold you out. It may just be because in our system, you end up taking half loaves.\nI could not be prouder of the Affordable Care Act, but it was a messy process. It doesn't have a public option. It's not single-payer. If I were designing a system from scratch, I would have designed a more elegant system and a more efficient system. But that's not what was possible in our democracy, in the same way that Social Security, when it first started, was a meagerly program providing benefits to just a few people and historically cut out for purely racist reasons domestic servants or sharecroppers or what have you. And then, over time, you kept on improving it. That's how change generally happens.\nAnd I think the thing that Democrats have to guard against is going in the direction that the Republicans are much further along on, and that is this sense of we are just going to get our way, and if we don't, then we'll cannibalize our own and then kick them out and try again, and we narrow our viewpoints more and more until finally, we stake out positions that are so extreme that they alienate the broad public. I don't see that being where the Democrats go. But it's always something that we have to pay attention to.\nOkay, yes.\nQ. My name is Shahrzad Daneshvar——\nThe President. Here, why don't you wait for the mike.\nSupreme Court Nomination Process\nQ. Oh. Thank you so much for being here. My name is Shahrzad Daneshvar, and I'd like to know how have your views on the Supreme Court nomination process changed since you taught Constitutional Law here at the University of Chicago.\nThe President. My views on how it should work hasn't changed. My views on how it currently works obviously are a source of frustration. Look, just to kind of wrap up this Supreme Court conversation, I think it is perfectly acceptable for Republicans to decide that even though Merrick Garland is highly qualified, even though he's indisputably a good and fair judge, even though he's gotten the highest ratings from all the bar organizations and others that have examined his record, that I just don't agree with him on X, Y, Z, and I'm going to vote against him because I believe in something different on important issues.\nWhat's not acceptable is not giving him a vote, not giving him a hearing, not meeting with him. What's not acceptable, I believe, is the increasing use of the filibuster for somebody who's clearly within the mainstream or to essentially say that we are going to nullify the ability of a President who is from another party from making an appointment. And we're going to wait to see if maybe we can get a guy from our party to make the appointment. That is where you have a process foul that corrodes the ability of the Court to function effectively.\nNow, if you play out how this—how much of a problem this could end up being—if in fact Mitch McConnell sticks to not giving a hearing and not giving a vote, and let's say, from their perspective, everything works out great and their nominee, whoever that might be, wins and takes over the White House, and they, then, make an appointment—the notion that Democrats would then say, oh, well, we'll just go along with that—[laughter]—I mean, that is inconceivable. Right?\nSo now the Democrats say, well, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. We're blocking—we'll wait 4 more years to see how the next President comes in, right? At which point, what's most likely then is Mitch McConnell will then eliminate the filibuster possibility for Supreme Court Justices, as was eliminated for the other judicial appointments. And now it's just a majoritarian exercise inside the Senate of who controls the Presidency and who controls the Senate. And if different parties control the White House and the Senate during that period of time, you're not going to get any appointments done, which is a disaster for the courts, generally.\nFor two reasons. One is, there's a lot of work that needs to get done, and you need judges. And right now there are emergency situations in districts across the country. But the second thing that happens is, people will, at that point, just become more and more cynical about decisions that are coming down from the Court. They're already cynical because so much of so many opinions just end up being straight 5-4, and it starts feeling like this is just a partisan alignment. But it gets much worse under these circumstances. People then just view the courts as an extension of our political parties—polarized political parties. And if confidence in the courts consistently breaks down, then you start seeing our attitudes about democracy generally starting to break down and legitimacy breaking down in ways that are very dangerous.\nSo, okay. It's a gentleman's turn. Right here in the front. I am impressed by the way you guys did all get dressed up. [Laughter] Was there a memo sent out? Did the Dean say, all right, you guys, we want you to all—because you all aren't going to class like this. [Laughter]\nMr. Strauss. They are not.\nThe President. I know. I remember. [Laughter]\nPrivacy/Political Participation/Voting Rights\nQ. Hello, Mr. President. Thank you very much for being here with us today. My name is Kyle Panton. I'm a 2L here at the law school. My question for you is, what sorts of constitutional questions were at the forefront of your mind when deciding who your nominee would—should be? And what sorts of constitutional questions do you think Americans should be asking themselves when assessing your selection and thinking about the 2016 Presidential election?\nThe President. That's interesting. Well, I will tell you, as I said before, I was—I'm very careful not to delve too specifically into a candidate's position on live issues. I mean, you're a well-informed 2L, you know the issues that people debate. There's a standard set of social issues that have been roiling society and the courts for a long time, whether it's LGBT rights or abortion or civil rights.\nThere are—what's interesting is, there are a set of new issues that are going to be coming up that, for your generation, I think are going to be increasingly salient. One great example is this whole debate around encryption, which I think is just the tip of the iceberg of what we're going to have to figure out. In a society in which so much of your life is digitized, people have a whole new set of privacy expectations that are understandable. They also expect, though, that since their lives are all digitized, that the digital world is safe, which creates a contradictory demand on government: Protect me from hackers, protect me from terrorists, protect me from et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, but I don't want you to know any of your business, and I don't even want you to have the ability to investigate some of that business when it happens because of its broader implications and we're worried about Big Brother. And so there's going to be a whole series of issues around that that I think will be coming up.\nI think there are a range of economic issues that date back very far, to the earliest days of the Court, and were prominent during the Great Depression and FDR's era that have gone into abeyance—people don't pay attention to them as much in terms of monopoly concentration or antitrust issues, et cetera—but I think in this current environment are going to be becoming more prominent over time. All right?\nSo—and then, political participation issues and voting issues, I think, and money in politics issues—that's a whole series of issues that I do believe are an important role for the Court to play. Because if we're not effectively setting the rules of the political process, if that is delegitimized, then whatever outcomes are generated are subject to just endless contention.\nAnd this is separate from the judiciary. This is your President editorializing. [Laughter] We really are the only advanced democracy on Earth that systematically and purposely makes it really hard for people to vote. And we sort of take it for granted. I mean, we sort of just assume, well, yes, that's, I guess, how it is. There's no other country on Earth that does that. And there's a legacy to that, I mean, that grows directly out of a history in which first propertied men, then White men, then White folks didn't want women, minorities to participate in the political process and be able to empower themselves in those—in that fashion.\nNow, that's the history. We should be a society in which, at this point, we said, yes, that's—that history wasn't so good, that's not who we are, and there was a Civil War fought about all this stuff, and we passed a whole series of laws like the Voting Rights Act, and at this point, we should be at the point where we say, you know what, we want everybody to vote, because that's the essence of our democracy. And we—but we have not just Federal laws, but State laws, that unabashedly discourage people from voting, which is why we have some of the lowest voting rates of any advanced democracy in the world.\nAnd that's a problem. That's not something that—I'm saying that to Congress, as well as to the Presidency, as well as to Governors, as well as State legislators, as well as to courts. That can't be right. It—there's no justification for that. You can't defend it.\nAnd I've always said—and this goes back to the young man's question earlier about political polarization—maybe the single biggest change that we could make in our political process that would reduce some of the polarization, make people feel more invested, restore integrity to the system, would be just make sure everybody is voting. Australia has got mandatory voting. You start getting 70, 80 percent voting rates, that's transformative.\nAll right. How much time do we have, by the way?\nStaffer. Time for one more, sir.\nThe President. How many?\nStaffer. One more, sir.\nThe President. We'll take two. [Laughter] Young lady in the green, right there in the sweater. Yes, that's you. Yes. You didn't remember what you were wearing today, did you? [Laughter]\nDiversity\nQ. Hardly—oh, okay. No, that's all right. So I think we can agree that in our Nation, we celebrate diversity: diversity of ethnicities, of races, of backgrounds. And I'm just wondering—oh, of course, at U Chicago, diversity of ideas. [Laughter] I'm just wondering what diverse characteristics Judge Garland would bring to the Supreme Court.\nThe President. Well, he's from Skokie—[laughter]—I think, which is very important. [Laughter] It's a great place. It's a great town. The way I've thought about diversity is not to think about any single seat as, oh, I've got to fill this slot with this demographic, but rather, if I've got a broad set of nominees to make, and this is true across the board, how do I make sure that I'm intentional throughout that process so that the talent of every American is—and every potential candidate gets a fair look? And I have confidence that if I stick to that, if I do that, if I make sure that I'm broadening the search, broadening the pool, looking at a bunch of folks even if they're not going through the conventional paths, that I'll be able—that I'll end up—the process will result in diversity.\nAnd that, in fact, is what's happened. I am—not to brag—[laughter]—but I have transformed the Federal courts from a diversity standpoint with a record that's been unmatched. We've got more African Americans on the circuit courts than we ever had before. We've got—I've appointed more African American women to the Federal courts than any other President before. I've appointed more Latinos than any President before. I've appointed more Native Americans, more Asian Americans, more LGBT judges than ever before.\nBut at no point did I say, oh, you know what, I need a Black lesbian from Skokie—[laughter]—in that slot. That's—can you find me one? [Laughter] You know? I mean, that's just not how I've approached it. It turns out that if the process is fair and you are saying that it's important that our courts are reflective of a changing society, you'll end up with a really good cross-section of people who are excellent. And that's who we've been able to appoint.\nAnd so, when I look at Merrick Garland, that was the person that—the difference between the Supreme Court is it—just a handful of seats come up at any given time now. I appointed a Latino woman and another woman right before that, so, yes, he's a White guy, but he's a really outstanding jurist. Sorry. [Laughter] You know, he's the—I think that's important.\nBut this speaks to the broader debate about diversity that I think is important and obviously churns up in college campuses a lot. The question is, have you set up a process and are you intentional about giving everybody a shot? And are you thinking about roadblocks to why we're not seeing a more diverse population? And when you start asking those questions, in whatever institution—I mean, I just met with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the combatant commanders, sort of our key military leaders. And the U.S. military, interestingly, has probably done as good of a job as any institution in our society when it comes to integration and bringing diverse people in, but as you go up the ranks, you start seeing that it becomes less and less reflective of the broader population and the troops, the men and women in uniform who are coming in.\nAnd so we've had a really interesting conversation about, well, what's happening? How much of this is that the young African American or Latino officer or woman officer isn't mentored by the person right above them and steered into particular assignments that are less likely to achieve a promotion? And what can we do about a different set of financial burdens that may exist? And if a lot of those folks are going into—as enlisted men and women, because that's the opportunity that was presented to them and nobody told them they could apply to West Point, what are we doing to find outstanding enlisteds, and saying, you'd make a good officer and we're going to groom you?\nAnd all of that does—that's not as satisfying as, when it comes to publicity, as just checking a box and saying, look, I appointed this person or that person in any particular slot. But that's where you start changing systems and you start changing institutions and you end up with a really broad-based change in access. And that's something that I really care deeply about because, just as is true in the military, it's true generally. Look, our society is changing. You cannot have a successful America if we are leaving out big chunks of the population from opportunity and leadership. It just doesn't work.\nIt's the same argument I make internationally in countries that are still repressing women, saying, your society cannot work, it doesn't work if half—if more than half of your population is constrained. If the half of that population that is most likely to be raising your children and teaching the next generation is not getting opportunity, your society will fail over the long term. And that's just true generally.\nSo, all right, one last question.\nQ. Immigration. What happens to your immigration—— The President. Excuse me, you were not called on. [Laughter] And you are a journalist. [Laughter] And I'm calling on students. So, thank you very much. This isn't a press——\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. This wasn't a press conference.\nSo the—let's just see, it's a gentleman's turn. This gentleman right there.\nU.S. Military Drone Program/Civilian Casualties in Military Operations/2011 U.S. Military Operation Targeting Usama bin Laden\nQ. Hi, my name is Saif Kazim, I'm a 3L. If you don't mind, I'm going to read my question.\nThe President. It's okay. This is what I was saying about it—you guys and your phones. [Laughter] By the way, are you now—I'm assuming you can't carry your phones into court, can you?\nQ. I think it depends. [Laughter]\nThe President. I'm just saying, you guys might want to practice. [Laughter]\nQ. Yes, I'll work on it. [Laughter]\nThe President. Go on.\nQ. I'll try to work on that. [Laughter] So one issue that Judge Garland would likely never be able to consider if he were confirmed concerns the President's authority to conduct drone strikes away from active battlefields. And these are strikes that you have continuously authorized on the basis of vague legal standards that you unilaterally deem to be satisfied in each case without ever appearing before a court and, in the process, killing hundreds of innocent civilians as well as, in some cases, American citizens. So my question is, how are these killings morally and legally justified? And what kind of message does this drone program send about America's values to the world, the American people, and to law students like myself who refuse to put our trust in an opaque process?\nThe President. Okay. I think that's a great question, although I will say that I will dispute some of the underlying premises that you asserted as facts. [Laughter] But I think it's an important topic, and it's a fair one.\nWhen I came into office, we were still in the midst of two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan. And in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Al Qaida was still highly active. And drone technologies began to develop in parallel with—had developed prior to my Presidency, but started to really accelerate in terms of the technology and the precision with which strikes could be taken.\nAnd the challenge for me as Commander in Chief has consistently been, how do you think about this new technology in a way that is consistent with morality, ideals, laws of war, but is also consistent with my first priority as President and Commander in Chief, which is to keep all of you safe, including you?\nAnd so I think it's fair to say that in the first couple of years of my Presidency, the architecture—legal architecture, administrative architecture, command structures—around how these were utilized was underdeveloped relative to how fast the technology was moving. So another way of saying this is, our military or our intelligence teams started seeing this as really effective. And they started just going because the goal was, let's get Al Qaida, let's get these leaders. There's a training camp here. There's a high-value target there. Let's move. And it was—the decisionmaking was not ad hoc, but it was embedded in decisions that are made all the time about a commander leading a military operation or an intelligence team trying to take out a terrorist. And there wasn't enough of an overarching structure, right?\nSo you may recall—but if not, I'm sure we can send it to you—I gave a speech at the National Defense University in which I said that we have to create an architecture for this because the potential for abuse—given the remoteness of these weapons and their lethality, we've got to come up with a structure that governs how we're approaching it. And that's what we've done. So I put forward what's called a—it's a Presidential directive. It's basically a set of administrative guidelines whereby these weapons are being used.\nNow, we actually did put forward a nonclassified version of what those directives look like. And it says that you can't use these weapons unless you have near certainty that there will not be civilian casualties; that you have near certainty that the targets you are hitting are, in fact, terrorist organizations that are intending to do imminent harm to the United States. And you've got all the agencies who are involved in that process, they have to get together and approve that. And it goes to the highest, most senior levels of our Government in order for us to make those decisions.\nAnd what I've also said is that we need to start creating a process whereby this—whereby public accountability is introduced so that you or citizens or Members of Congress outside of the Intelligence Committee can look at the facts and see whether or not we're abiding by what we say are these norms.\nAnd we're actually—there's a lot of legal aspects to this because part of the problem here is, is that this drone program initially came through the intelligence side under classified programs, as opposed to the military. Part of what I've also said is, I don't want our intelligence agencies being a paramilitary organization. That's not their function. As much as possible this should be done through our Defense Department so that we can report; here's why—what we did, here's why we did it, here's our assessment of what happened.\nAnd so slowly we are pushing it in that direction. My hope is, is that by the time I leave office there is a—not only an internal structure in place that governs these standards that we've set, but there is also a institutionalized process whereby the actions that the U.S. Government takes through drone technology are consistently reported on on an annualized basis so that people can look.\nAnd the reason I say—the reason this is really important to me—and this was implied in your question—is there is a lot of misinformation about this. There is no doubt—and I said this in an interview, I think, recently—there is no doubt that some innocent people have been killed by drone strikes. It is not true that it has been this sort of willy-nilly, let's bomb a village. It—that is not how it's—folks have operated. And what I can say with great certainty is that the rate of civilian casualties in any drone operation are far lower than the rate of civilian casualties that occur in conventional war.\nSo the irony—let's take an example like the bin Laden raid. This was as precise, as effective an operation that I don't think anybody would dispute was in the national security interests of the United States. And we put our best people in there who operate as precisely and as effectively as any group of individuals probably ever have in the history of the planet. And they executed their mission flawlessly. But there were a number of people who were killed in that who you might describe as not the targets of the mission: members of bin Laden's family, for example. Now, that would be counted as a civilian casualty under the standards that—from which you drew your information. And if you calculated it as a percentage, there was actually a pretty high civilian casualty rate for this extraordinarily precise mission.\nNow, imagine during the height of the Iraq war or when we were still actively fighting in Afghanistan, the number of civilians who were killed in normal military operations. We talk about the number of U.S. troops that were killed in Iraq. The number of Iraqis that were killed—primarily by AQI and those we were fighting, but also by U.S. military that was trying to be as careful as possible in chaotic situations, like Fallujah or Ramadi—were in the tens of thousands.\nSo part of my job as President is to figure out how I can keep America safe doing the least damage possible in really tough, bad situations. And I don't have the luxury of just not doing anything and then being able to stand back and feel as if my conscience is completely clear. I have to make decisions because there are folks out there who are genuinely trying to kill us and would be happy to blow up this entire room without any compunction and are actively finding—trying to find ways to do it.\nAnd I wish I could just send in Iron Man, or—[laughter]—no, no, I don't mean that as a joke. I just mean I wish I—that the tragedy of war, conflict, terrorism, et cetera, did not end up creating circumstances where we, wielding kinetic power, don't end up hurting anybody who shouldn't have been hurt.\nBut what I try to do is to set up the system as best as I can. And I think it is very important for those who are critics of the U.S. Government—and this includes folks on the outside—to examine the incredible progress that we've made over the course of a couple of decades. Because this conversation didn't even exist—it did not even cross the minds of people in the White House—as recently as 30 or 40 years ago. I mean, it wasn't even a factor. And we anguish over this in a very serious way.\nBut I—what I do think is a legitimate concern is, is that—the transparency issues. I think that the way that this got built up through our intelligence and what's called our Title 50 programs meant that it did not—it wasn't subject to the same amount of democratic debate as when we are conducting what are called Title 10 Department of Defense conventional operations. And that's done a disservice not only to the public being able to examine where we made mistakes and create corrective action, it's actually also done a disservice to the incredibly dedicated men and women in intelligence and in operations who perform these operations who are subject to accusations that somehow they're irresponsible and bloodless and going around blowing up children, which is not the case.\nAnd our popular media, I think, has been able to just project a whole bunch of scenarios that are generally not accurate.\nI guess I should stop there. [Laughter] But thank you for the question. It was a legitimate one.\nI'll end when I—where I started. Just based on the quality of the questions and your very sharp appearances—[laughter]—you guys have an enormous amount to contribute. Don't let the day-to-day noise and news and frustrations with our democracy discourage you from being involved.\nI'm phasing out of this particular part of my life. But I've said this before—and this—I believed it when I was teaching here, I believe it even more now after having been President—the most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen. I really believe that. Change happens when citizens are informed, are engaged, are paying attention, are asking tough questions—asking tough questions of themselves, by the way, not just of others—not too comfortable in whatever dogmas that we all attach ourselves to. And you are learning the kind of critical thinking in this school that will allow you to become really good citizens. Use it.\nThanks.\nMr. Strauss.

They have just been such great friends and supporters for so long. And all the things that she listed we would not have done without them. So we are grateful for them.\nWe've got a number of Members of Congress here who I just want to acknowledge, because part of what we're here about tonight is, democracy doesn't function unless we've got Members of Congress who are serious about their jobs. It doesn't matter who's in the White House if we don't have the kind of hard work and dedication that these Members display. So I just want to acknowledge them real quick. Xavier Becerra. Karen Bass. Where's Karen? Ted Lieu. Brad Sherman. The DCCC chair, Ben Ray Luján. And my copartner in everything good that we've been able to accomplish—if something didn't work, it was my mistake. [Laughter] Whatever did work, it was because of the outstanding work of Nancy Pelosi. So we're grateful to her.\nYou guys have been in these before. I'm not going to give a long speech. I actually was—I conducted a class today. I was back in my old haunts in Chicago. I've been accused of being professorial sometimes—[laughter]—so I just decided, you know what, I'm just going to roll with this. And I had a bunch of law students, and they're used to it, and it was fine. [Laughter] And we talked about Merrick Garland and the vacancy that currently exists in the Supreme Court.\nAnd no one disputes Mr. Garland's credentials. Uniformly, Democrats, Republicans, jurists, lawyers, editorial boards—they all acknowledge that rarely has there been somebody this well-qualified to send to the Supreme Court. And yet what we've seen out of the Republicans in the Senate is not simply a refusal to confirm him thus far, but a refusal to meet with him or to have a hearing or to have a vote. And the point that I made to these sharp young law students—who, by the way, were all wearing suits and ties. And I said, this is not how you go to class. [Laughter] I taught here. You can't fool me.\nAudience member. This isn't how we go——\nThe President. That's what I figured. Right. But what I told them was, that setting aside whatever political predispositions you may have, our democracy only works if there's a respect and appreciation of the process of self-governance; that there's a belief that we can be principled and passionate about the issues that we care about, but we also have an obligation to make sure that this incredible experiment in self-governance continues. And that requires an adherence to facts and science. It requires a sense of compromise. It requires a realization that the institutions that the Founders set up only work effectively if people bring some measure of good will and appreciation that we're not just always thinking about the next election, but we're thinking about the next generation.\nAnd I made the argument—which I deeply believe—that if in fact the Senate refuses to even give a hearing to Mr. Garland, that the basic compact that we have in a big, diverse country like this, our ability to cooperate and find the solutions to the big challenges that we face will deteriorate to such a point where it's going to be very difficult for anybody—and any President—to do what it needs to do.\nAnd this is just one example of the challenges that we've been facing for a while now. Most of us aren't born partisan. I mean, Nancy—maybe. [Laughter] But most of us at the age of 2 or 3, we're not thinking blue and red. And so I believe in an honest debate, and I don't believe that Democrats have a monopoly on wisdom. And I think that the country benefits from a strong two-party system. And during the course of my Presidency, one of the things I desperately sought is a loyal opposition that could challenge me and to point out my blind spots and engage in a back and forth so that I could make better decisions and we could move the country forward more effectively.\nBut that's not what we've had. And I've said this before: It's not as if Democrats don't think about politics. This is a business in which we're trying to get people elected. And we have a point of view. And we care about making sure that we're dealing with climate change. And we believe in immigration reform. And we want every child in America to get a decent education. And we believe that the economy works best when everybody gets a shot. And we are passionate about equal rights and that every American is deserving of dignity, regardless of race and gender and sexual orientation. We believe in these things deeply. We believe in them strongly. But we're also politicians. We care about getting elected. And we recognize that there are times in a big democracy like this that we've got to compromise.\nBut in each instance—and I can say this about Nancy Pelosi, and I can say this about every Member of Congress who's here—when we've had to get something done on behalf of the country as a whole, when something really counts, when it's really important, even if it's not politically convenient but we've been willing to do that, these folks have taken tough votes that were contrary to their political interests and, in some cases, contrary to what their most ardent supporters want, because we understood we had a certain responsibility to get things done.\nAnd that's what we have not seen from the other side. And that's why this election is so important. And I recognize that there is a deep obsession right now about Mr. Trump. And one of you pulled me aside and squeezed me hard and said, tell me that Mr. Trump is not succeeding you. And I said, Mr. Trump is not succeeding me. [Laughter] But what I also said was, Mr. Trump has actually done a service, as Mr. Cruz is doing a service. And that is, laying bare unvarnished some of the nonsense that we've been dealing with in Congress on a daily basis. People act as if these folks are outliers. But they're not. Listen to talk radio, watch their interviews. Look at how they operate in town halls. They're saying stuff that's just as wacky as what we're hearing out of the Presidential candidates. It's just nobody was paying attention. And so we should thank Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz for just being honest. This is how we're thinking these days—we're not thinking these days.\nBut it gives you a sense of what's at stake in this election. I mean, I can give you a long list of particulars about any issue under the sun and why the positions we take are sound and will help move America in a better direction, and the positions that they take will take us backwards. That's not hard to do. But what I'm suggesting is it's more than that. What's at stake right now is how our democracy functions. What's at stake right now is do we make sure that the highest offices in the land, the people who represent us and who are shaping the future for our kids and our grandkids and children after then, that they act responsibly; that they don't consider compromise a dirty word; that they listen to what people who disagree with them have to say; that they're respectful of those who are not like them; that they care about what is happening beyond our borders, and recognize that ultimately our well-being and our children's well-being and our grandchildren's well-being is tied up with what's happening to some kid in Guatemala or some child in sub-Saharan Africa.\nAnd so I'll just close with this, and then I'll be happy to take some questions. There are times where, as devoted as all of you are, when I'm traveling through Democratic circles I see: \"Oh, Mr. President, we love you so, and we're going to miss you so. And sometimes, I'm not that excited about this election.\" And I say, I have no patience for that. I say thank you very much, first. [Laughter] But then I say to folks, we cannot be complacent, and we cannot be cynical, because the stakes are too high. And we should take pride in what we've accomplished over the last 7½ years, not because every problem was fixed, but because it showed the steady progress that happens when people who love this country decide to change it. And that should be a spur, a call to action. And it starts not just at the Presidential level, but in us recognizing the enormous power of Congress and the difference between a Nancy Pelosi being Speaker of the House and a Paul Ryan being Speaker of the House.\nSo I hope all of you are fired up and ready to go, because I am. I'm not on the ballot. I'm just fine with that. [Laughter] But I've said this before—quoting Louis Brandeis, I believe—the most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen. And even if I'm not President, and contrary to the assertions of some, I will continue to be a citizen. [Laughter] And I care deeply about what happens next. So let's get going. Let's get to work.\nThank you, everybody. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-04-07", "title": "Remarks at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Dinner in Los Angeles, California"}

As of this week, Kasich is the only Republican in the race who consistently beats Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head matchup, winning by a six-point average margin on Real Clear Politics. He's also the only Republican with higher favorables than unfavorables, by 43 to 30, a 13-point positive margin.\n—\nAs a former three-term chairman of the House budget committee, Kasich knows how to broker a compromise; having him in the White House with Paul Ryan as speaker figures to work well – especially in comparison to Cruz, who has a record of obstructionism in the Senate. And as governor of Ohio since 2011, Kasich has turned a near $8 billion state budget deficit into a $2 billion surplus while cutting taxes and funding K-12 schools at an all-time high; unemployment has fallen from 9.2 percent to 4.9 percent; and Ohio has become one of the top job-creating states in the country.

He is the only candidate left on either ballot with the combination of integrity, temperament, experience and maturity to honorably lead America.\nIf Trump doesn't reach Cleveland in July with the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination on the first ballot, the campaign for all practical purposes starts anew.\n[...]\nKasich is the best choice for a number of reasons. First, he starts with a base of delegates already, about 10 percent of those that have been awarded. That's a small number, for sure, but every delegate will be priceless once the bargaining starts.\nHe's also had the benefit of being in the campaign from the beginning. He's competed in every primary, and has a nationwide organization.

If it continues to be a three-man race, it's difficult to see a path for Trump to arrive in Cleveland with the required delegates.\nRepublicans will need broader choices, and someone who committed to the race should get preference.

But it's also a severe expense that holds many Americans back well into adulthood.\nAbout 70 percent of college graduates take out loans to finance their education. Across the country, Americans hold a staggering $1.2 trillion in student debt—the second highest source of consumer debt behind home mortgages. And that number continues to climb.\nThe graduating class of 2016 is slated to be the most indebted in U.S. history—and loan balances are disproportionately high for low-income students, including students of color.\nSo how does student debt really affect your bottom line in the long run? It's more than you might expect.\nAmong the class of 2014, the average undergraduate who took out loans borrowed just over $28,950. Paid back over 20 years at the unsubsidized federal loan rate, he or she would owe $186.00 per month.\nThose payments—every month for two decades—really add up.\nFor instance:\nIf you put that money in a savings account, you'd have more than $11,000 saved in just five years.\nIf you invested that money in a mutual fund for 10 years, you could bank more than $27,000.\nAnd if you put all of those monthly payments in a 401(k), you could have?$86,000 put aside for retirement in 20 years.\nSource: smartasset.com (Assumes a 6% annual rate of return)\nStudies suggest that student debt is holding back young people from life milestones like getting married, buying homes, having children, and starting small businesses.\nAnd according to a 2013 study by the think tank Demos, college-educated households with student debt stand to lose $208,000 over a lifetime, mostly from a lack of retirement savings.\nEducation should hold the key to a brighter future—not a lifetime of debilitating debt.\nThat's why Hillary Clinton has released a plan for debt-free college. Under her plan, students won't have to take out loans to pay for tuition, books, or fees at four-year public colleges and universities in their states. Families will make an affordable, realistic contribution and students will do their part by working 10 hours a week to help pay for school.\nThose with existing student debt will be able to refinance at a lower rate, which will give debt relief to an estimated 25 million borrowers. And Hillary's plan will allow everyone to enroll in an income-based repayment plan so that they're never spending more than 10 percent of their income on student loans.\n\" We need to make a quality education affordable and available to everyone willing to work for it, without saddling them with decades of debt.\"Hillary, August 10, 2015\nRead more about how Hillary's college plan could help you or someone you know.", "timestamp": "2016-04-08", "title": "Press Release - How Much Could You Save For Retirement If You Weren't Paying Off Student Loans?"}

PDT\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Hi, everyone. Good to see you all. So a couple things at the top before we get into your questions, a few scheduling updates for next week.\nFirst of all, when it comes to *Judge Justice Garland, as you know, he's had a number of meetings on the Hill -- up to 21 meetings now with senators. And we have a host of other meetings to announce for next week, so I'll just go ahead and read through those.\nOn Tuesday, Judge Garland will meet with Senators Chuck Grassley, Lisa Murkowski, Cory Booker, and Pat Toomey. On Wednesday, Judge Garland will meet with Senators Angus King, Mark Warner, Kelly Ayotte, Patty Murray, and Claire McCaskill. On Thursday, he'll meet with Senators Rob Portman, Tammy Baldwin, Jeff Flake, Michael Bennet, and Elizabeth Warren.\nQ: Do we know where the Grassley meeting is going to be?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I don't have any updates on schedule location at this point.\nSo that's obviously continued progress on both the meetings on the Hill and the process forward from here. So expect you'll hear more from him and more from other senators who will continue to be impressed with his qualifications following those meetings.\nThe other quick item at the top, also a scheduling update for next week, totally unrelated, is that next Wednesday, the President will convene his National Security Council at the CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to review our efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL and advance prospects for peace and stability in Syria.\nWe expect the President will have an opportunity to address these initiatives in a brief statement following the meeting. And as you recall, this is one in a series of meetings that the President has held with his National Security Council. He held a meeting at the Department of Defense and the Department of State, as well. So this is another one in a series of updates and meetings.\nSo with that, I will turn it over to your questions.\nQ: Is there something prompting him to hold the meeting over at the CIA? First of all, is there something prompting him to have the meeting in general, and then to do it over at CIA Headquarters?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So I think as I mentioned, this is one in a series of meetings that he's held in a variety of agencies, so there's no particular operational reason for him having it there. It's just the next in a series of these meetings.\nQ: You said that the meetings next week with Garland represent continued progress. How do you -- is there anything in particular you can point to that you think got them to meet with him?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Well, I think there is no question that he's exceptionally qualified. And you don't have to take my word for that. As you've seen him -- you've seen the reaction of both senators who have met with him from both sides of the aisle. Certainly, you heard a number of words from Senator Collins on that over the past week or so. But others outside, as well. You've got judicial experts and former judges and justices, as well.\nSo this is something that as he continues to make his case in these meetings, the evidence will be coming in clear that he is the best candidate out there. And I think the next step is for him to make that case to the American people, and he'll hopefully have the ability to do so in hearings.\nQ: Jen, at the fundraiser last night, the President talked about how he's been hearing quite a bit from Democrats that -- both, of course, that they wish that he was not leaving the Oval Office but that they were that excited about the election. And he said, I've got no patience for that, and obviously urged Democrats not to be complacent. Can you elaborate a little more on how widespread is the sentiment that the President is hearing? Does it tend to come from people who are supporters of either Senator Sanders or former Secretary of State Clinton? Thank you.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Thanks, Juliet. So I think the President has said what he's said many times before, which is that it's critical for Democrats to get out there and vote and support Democratic candidates. And that obviously -- this was a fundraiser for the DCCC, and so that was particularly the name of the game last night.\nSo this is I think very consistent with what you've heard him say, is that as we continue to get further along in campaign season and the differences between Democrats and Republicans become even more stark, it's increasingly important for Democrats to get out there. And that will be a case he'll continue to make in the months ahead.\nQ: Right, but can you provide any more details of -- in other words, does he see this lack of enthusiasm as a significant problem, as just a minor problem at this point? Can you clarify that?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I don't think he specifically said there was any lack of enthusiasm. I think he was making clear a point that he's made many times, which is that as we continue to see the stark differences in policy positions between Democrats, who want to build on the progress we've seen and continue to move our country forward and look out for the middle class, and then what you all know very well to be what we're hearing from the Republican side of the aisle, it couldn't be more important for Democrats to get out there and vote. And that's the case that he was making and he'll continue to make.\nQ: Can I ask you about something else he said last night, that Ted Cruz and Donald Trump show the craziness that's been there, the wackiness in the right wing and in Congress? Does the President believe that he -- that that is fully -- that explains fully the relationship that he's had with Congress over his seven years in office?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I think you heard a couple different things from the President last night and, again, something that he's said a number of times. When it comes to the Republican Party and the rhetoric that we're hearing on the trail, which I think is your first point, that is something that is increasingly -- makes it increasingly clear that the difference between Republicans and Democrats across the board -- not just the couple specific candidates you mentioned, but in general -- couldn't be more pronounced.\nI think when it comes to what we need to get done on the Hill, you've also heard the President and others talk about a whole host of issues where Republicans have said they'd be supportive and are interested in working together, and there are areas where we should be able to get things done. And I think it is increasingly important and continues to be important that we find those areas of common agreement -- to name a few, criminal justice reform, adequate funding for Zika, battling the opioid epidemic, things like Puerto Rico and the earned income tax credit -- all of which are areas that Republicans have said they want to work together with us on.\nAnd I think the President and others have been incredibly clear about the fact that these are -- there's no reason to wait on these issues. And now that's on top of a whole host of other issues that he thinks we should also be working on in Congress -- minimum wage, the inversions loophole, affordable college education.\nSo there's no shortage of areas that we should be able to work with Republicans on the Hill, and we call on them increasingly to do so.\nQ: But when he looks back at his presidency and the problems that he's had with Congress, does he take the blame for it at all, or is it because of this Republican attitude that he says is in Cruz and Trump and reflected -- and then just being honest about what it's been under a Republican Congress all along? Is it the Republicans' fault entirely, or is it his fault in part?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I think the President has spoken to sort of the broader political state of affairs at length. He obviously spoke about this at the Toner Awards dinner a couple weeks ago, so you've heard him address this more broadly. I think how the various sections of the Republican Party are communicating and interacting with each other, we'll leave that to others to weigh in on.\nQ: Jen, does the White House have any reaction to some of the Obama campaign and foundation donors showing up, names like David Geffen showing up in the Panama Papers as having offshore accounts? Is there any reaction to that? I know the President has talked -- he's concerned about some of the revelations from the Panama Papers.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So I've seen some of the reports of various names out there, but we're not going to be in a position to comment on any of the specific names that have been reported generally. As you know, this is something that DOJ is looking into broadly. But I don't have any specific comments for you on names.\nQ: On foreign policy, in Syria, an American has been released, and the State Department talked about that. But I'm wondering if you can say -- the Russian foreign ministry has said that President Obama asked President Putin directly and personally for help. Is that the case? Can you comment on that?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Thanks, Roberta. So, generally, we can confirm and welcome the news that a U.S. citizen was released by Syrian authorities. And, as you know, the U.S. continues to work through every possible means to ensure the safe release of U.S. citizens reported missing or taken hostage in Syria. And that's something that has been and continues to be a priority for the President. It's something you've heard him speak about on a number of occasions.\nSo on any specific conversations that you referenced earlier, I don't have any comment on that.\nQ: Jen, United Health Care announced today that it is pulling out of Obamacare in two states. It had said last year it may do something like this. But despite the fact that it may not have been a complete surprise, is this a concern to the administration that this could be the beginning of more -- of United Health Care or other insurance companies dropping out?\nMS. FRIENDMAN: Thanks, Angela. So I did see those reports a little bit earlier today. I'd say a couple things generally, which is, first of all, that the number of issuers participating in the marketplace in general through -- in 2016 has grown. And I'd remind you that in the last open enrollment period, nearly 13 million people signed up for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. So, clearly, coverage is a product that Americans need and continue to want. So the individual decision of one issuer, we're not going to comment on individual business decisions, but that's not something that's indicative of the marketplace in general.\nQ: There have been differing reports about the auspices under which Senator Sanders is visiting the Vatican, where the campaign is offering a slightly different explanation for how he's coming there than the Vatican Council itself. Has the White House been watching those reports, and do you have any comments on what are the dynamics that are going on there?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: I've seen a couple news headlines on that back-and-forth, but I don't have anything to offer on campaign travel.\nQ: The President and Malia looked really happy as they got on the plane. What is she doing on the trip? And can you tell us anything more about what she's been doing while the President has been fundraising today?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So I don't have any additional details beyond what my colleague, Eric Schultz, said yesterday. So, occasionally, the President gets to travel with his family members and appreciates that opportunity. But I don't have any details about her schedule.\nQ: Following up on the inversions rule from yesterday, the administration has expressed confidence that the earnings-stripping provisions would survive a court challenge. I'm curious what that optimism is based on.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So for the details of how these tax regulations came together, I would refer you to the Treasury Department and the IRS, who can walk through with you the legal justification for these rules. But I do know that, in general, as you know, this is something that the Treasury Department has been working on for at least a couple of years now, and something that the President has talked about at length, which is the importance of closing these loopholes that allow companies to skirt the rules by moving their headquarters overseas on paper in order to avoid paying taxes. And that's something that the President believes is wrong and should be stopped, and businesses should play by the rules and operate on a level playing field.\nAnd so when it comes to the specific ins and outs of tax law, I think Treasury would be in the best position to answer that for you.\nQ: Would it be fair to expect the administration to take a more activist role like we saw this week on mergers that it might see as disadvantageous to consumers?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: So if you're referring to some of the reports you've seen out of FTC or DOJ decisions, those are independent enforcement decisions that come out of the DOJ or FTC.\nQ: I'm thinking inversions in particular, but extrapolating to mergers more generally.\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Well, I think, again, these rules were being developed by the Treasury Department for many, many months, years now. So I think I'd refer you to them on anything else that may or may not be on the horizon.\nQ: Do you have the week ahead?\nMS. FRIEDMAN: Yes. All right, let's do the week ahead. (Laughter.) Great. I already gave you a good portion of it.\nSo on Monday and Tuesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nOn Wednesday, the President will host the 2016 White House Science Fair and celebrate the student winners of a broad range of science, technology, engineering and math -- STEM -- competitions from across the country. This year's White House Science Fair will highlight the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of this next generation of students, and the opportunity they have to tackle our toughest challenges.\nIn the afternoon -- so this is Wednesday afternoon -- as I mentioned, the President will convene his National Security Council at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to review our efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL, and advance prospects for peace and stability in Syria. The session is the latest in a series of NSC meetings in recent months convened at key departments and agencies, including the Department of State and Department of Defense.\nOn Thursday, the President will welcome the Wounded Warrior Ride to the White House, a cycling event to help wounded warriors restore their physical and emotional well-being, and raise awareness of our nation's heroes who battle the physical and psychological damages of war. Building on the President's efforts to honor and thank our veterans for their service, the kickoff event brings together former servicemembers from numerous veterans organizations, empowering and supporting veterans and their families across the nation.\nAnd on Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nAll right. Thank you, everyone.\nEND 1:00 P.M. PDT", "timestamp": "2016-04-08", "title": "Press Gaggle by Deputy Press Secretary Jennifer Friedman"}

During the 35th National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we stand with victims and their families, and we strive to ensure every person—regardless of age, color, or creed—who is victimized by crime knows they are protected, respected, and heard.\nCertain populations are more vulnerable to crime, and my Administration is committed to defending the rights of crime victims everywhere and safeguarding their access to essential resources and services. Violence against women, including sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking, is too prevalent in our society, and we will continue doing everything we can to shine a light on these crimes wherever they exist, including on our campuses and in our military. We are taking action to reduce the number of untested rape kits in America—critical tools that can deliver justice for victims in the wake of an assault—and the Department of Justice issued new guidance to prevent gender bias when responding to cases of sexual assault and domestic violence. Additionally, the My Brother's Keeper initiative is working to reduce violence and secure second chances for our youth to ensure all young people—including those from communities disproportionately affected by violent crime—have the opportunities and resources they need to reach their full potential.\nA victim's immediate interactions after a crime are often with the law enforcement officials who are the first to respond. In 2014, I created the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing (Task Force), and in addition to promoting ways to enhance public safety across America, the Task Force issued recommendations to strengthen public trust between local law enforcement and communities, which increases the likelihood that victims and witnesses will cooperate with law enforcement after a crime. My Administration will also continue working to support the most vulnerable among us who are subject to heinous crimes—including children who are forced into sex trafficking and denied their inherent human rights, and seniors who, in too many cases, are exposed to abuse, neglect, and exploitation.\nWhen a crime does occur, we owe it to those who suffer in its aftermath to uplift them and stand beside them. This week, as we honor those dedicated to ensuring services and support are available for victims of crime, let us rededicate ourselves to protecting crime victims' rights and upholding the basic belief that all people should be able to live safely and free from fear, violence, and intimidation.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 10 through April 16, 2016, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by participating in events that raise awareness of victims' rights and services, and by volunteering to serve victims in their time of need. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-08", "title": "Proclamation 9418—National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2016"}

People of all ages can volunteer, and anyone can, through the smallest of acts, do their part to improve the lives of others. This week, we celebrate the selfless individuals around our country who channel their civic virtues through volunteerism, and we encourage more people to make service an integral part of their lives.\nIn National Parks and public schools, food pantries and animal shelters, volunteers fan out in communities across America, devoted to a cause bigger than themselves. In crisis and disaster, they offer not only goods and resources, but also understanding and sympathy to those desperate and distraught. In underserved neighborhoods, they help cultivate hope and inspiration, rolling back poverty and roadblocks to opportunity. Generations of these often unsung heroes—driven by their conviction that we all have a stake in each other—have lifted up those they know and those they do not, making our Nation and our world a better place.\nMy Administration is dedicated to giving people more opportunities to serve. I established a Task Force on Expanding National Service that supports the expansion of service and volunteer projects to address some of our Nation's highest priorities. Through the Corporation for National and Community Service, AmeriCorps and Senior Corps have mobilized millions of Americans, sending them to areas in need of dedicated volunteers. Under these programs, we have established campaigns that address specific needs in vulnerable communities, such as increasing access to college, improving STEM education, and preserving our environment. I have also called on 200,000 Federal scientists and engineers to help mentor young people in STEM fields. And in 2014, I launched the Employers of National Service initiative, connecting employers with AmeriCorps and Peace Corps alumni—because often the most talented, tireless, and mission-driven employees are those who have given of themselves for the betterment of others. In the time since, hundreds of employers have signed up to participate in this program.\nVolunteers help drive our country's progress, and day in and day out, they make extraordinary sacrifices to expand promise and possibility. During National Volunteer Week, let us shed the cynicism that says one person cannot make a difference in the lives of others by embracing each of our individual responsibilities to serve and shape a brighter future for all.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 10 through April 16, 2016, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by volunteering in service projects across our country and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives.

As we mark 126 years since its founding, we also celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Inter-American Democratic Charter—a declaration of our belief in democracy as the common form of government for all countries in our hemisphere. On Pan American Day and during Pan American Week, we reflect on the progress our countries have made together, and we recommit to reaching for a brighter day for all our peoples.\nThroughout our hemisphere, increased integration has generated greater growth and prosperity. Since I took office, exports and imports between the United States and the rest of the hemisphere have increased by more than 50 percent. We are involved in more trade and economic partnerships that reduce poverty, spur opportunity, and empower young people with the skills and job training they need to compete in the global economy. Our nations have partnered to develop clean, affordable, and reliable energy sources and ensure all countries have open access to data to combat climate change—a reality that threatens all our peoples and that we addressed in Paris late last year, when the world came together to negotiate the most ambitious climate agreement in history.\nThe nations of the Americas have made tremendous progress on important issues, and our work remains rooted in the bonds of friendship and family between our peoples. For too long, the United States and Cuba remained isolated, and while our governments will continue to have areas of disagreement, our people have long shared common values and ideals. That is why we reestablished diplomatic relations between our countries—for the first time in over 50 years, the American flag flies above our reopened embassy in Havana; and I recently visited our neighbor 90 miles to the South, becoming the first United States President to do so in nearly nine decades. By extending a new hand of friendship to the Cuban people, we mark the beginning of a relationship that will offer fresh hope for both our futures and improve the lives of those living in both our countries. Following my trip to Cuba, I visited Argentina, which has begun advancing ambitious reforms to spur economic growth and has pledged to help address important global challenges, such as peacekeeping and the Syrian refugee crisis.\nAcross the board, the United States has deepened our engagement in the Americas. We initiated the 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative to encourage more exchanges between our hemisphere's students. Last year, I launched the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative, which will address opportunity gaps that persist for too many of our neighboring nations' youth by empowering them with the tools and resources they need to reach their full potential. Just as our countries must foster hope and prosperity, we must also address serious challenges. We will continue defending and strengthening civil society, because when all our people have a voice in shaping the future of our hemisphere, we all do better. The United States is working with Colombia to reduce violence and achieve peace, as we do throughout Central America. We will also keep coordinating with the nations of the Americas to prevent, detect, and respond to the spread of Zika. And later this year, I look forward to joining other leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Peru for the next Economic Leaders' meeting.\nMillions of people in the United States are tied to the rest of the countries in our hemisphere through commerce and family. We are more than just nations—we are neighbors, bound in common cause and possibility not by our leaders, but by the citizens of the Americas and the interests we share. Let us move forward, as one people, in a spirit of unity and cooperation. Together, we can reach a future in which every young person—from Argentina to Alaska—knows peace, dignity, and opportunity, and can embark on paths that stretch beyond their neighborhood and into the wider Western Hemisphere and the entire world.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2016, as Pan American Day and April 10 through April 16, 2016, as Pan American Week. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of the other areas under the flag of the United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-08", "title": "Proclamation 9420—Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2016"}

On National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, we salute the selfless service members throughout our history who gave of their own liberty to ensure ours, and we renew our commitment to remaining a Nation worthy of their extraordinary sacrifices.\nIn wars and engagements since America's founding, brave patriots have experienced indescribable suffering as prisoners of war. Often physically and mentally tortured, starved, and put through the worst most of us could imagine, these heroes are owed a debt we can never fully repay, and their families—who exhibited tremendous fortitude in the face of grueling uncertainty—are worthy of our profound gratitude. The values of honor, courage, and selflessness that drive our Armed Forces are particularly acute in those who have been taken as prisoners of war, sustaining them through days, weeks, and sometimes years of profound hardship endured for the sake of securing the blessings of liberty for all.\nAmerica's former prisoners of war—and all who don our uniform to keep us safe—have helped make our Nation the strongest and most prosperous in the history of the world.

Well, it is so good to see all of you.\nI will begin where Nancy began, and that is just thanking Ann and Gordon for their incredible hospitality. They have been great friends to a lot of causes and a lot of civic efforts, but they've been great friends to me, personally. And in some ways, I almost feel like I'm coming full circle here because the first time I was here I had no gray hair—[laughter]—and I was just beginning what would end up being this remarkable journey of ours, and it was by no means clear how it would turn out. But they were early friends and supporters and have been with me through thick and thin. And I'm so proud of them and so thankful for everything they have done. So give them one more round of applause.\nOf course, the reason we're here is because we think a Democratic Congress is good for America. And if you need some evidence of that, then you can look at the Members who are here—Jared, Anna, Barbara—bringing passion and dedication and common sense and hard work to the business of making sure every kid in this country gets a decent education, and that we're protecting our planet from the ravages of climate change and making sure that our international relations are based on firmness and toughness and an outstanding military, but also a generosity of spirit and a willingness to engage former adversaries.\nI've done a lot of tough stuff since I've been President. I couldn't do it unless I had outstanding legislators who had my back, even when it wasn't politically convenient. And these three are just a sampling of the great folks that we've got in Congress. And so please give them a big round of applause. I'm thankful to them.\nAnd then, at the risk of being a member of the mutual admiration society, I love me some Nancy Pelosi. I was with some folks last night; we had done an event down in L.A., and afterwards I'm talking to some friends and supporters. And they were extolling Nancy's virtues, and they were explaining how, oh, and she is just so intelligent and so passionate, and she cares about all these issues, and so full of integrity, I don't know how she gets it all done. And I said, all those things are true, but she also is at daughter of a former Baltimore mayor. [Laughter] So don't let the whole Northern California, cappuccino-sipping thing fool you. [Laughter] And that combination of idealism and just tough-as-nails conviction and savvy is the reason why this country has made such enormous strides over these last 7 years. I could not have had a better partner than Nancy Pelosi. And I mean that. It's true.\nAnd Paul is all right also. [Laughter] He's okay. He's all right. He's all right. He's a genial sidekick. [Laughter] Since I'm on the subject, I have never seen—and I'm sure others have—but I've never seen this man in a bad mood or anything other than gracious and generous to people. And that's a pretty remarkable thing. So a man of great character who I really have come to love. I mean that.\nAll right. We've got some work to do. I was at the University of Chicago yesterday. As I think some of the Fourth Estate remarked—they've said in the past that I'm professorial, and so I just let 'er rip. I said, you know what, I'm just going to go with it. [Laughter] I'm going to go back to my roots—and was in an auditorium with law students and law professors. And the subject was the Supreme Court. As you know, we have a vacancy currently. And I have nominated an individual who no one disputes is one of the most qualified people ever to be nominated to the Supreme Court—currently, Chief Justice of the DC Circuit, often considered the second most important court in the land after the Supreme Court.\nDemocrats and Republicans alike in the past have extolled his temperament, his intellect, his consensus-building. He was confirmed all but unanimously when he ascended to his current position. Chief Justice Roberts has said good things about him. And yet, we have a Republican Senate that has decided not only not to vote for him, but to not give the American people an opportunity to hear what he has to say through a hearing—or, for that matter, even meet with him. At least that was their original position.\nAnd I used the occasion at the University of Chicago to explain that, setting aside the merits of Judge Garland, setting aside the fact that he led the investigation in the Oklahoma City bombing, by all accounts in a way that ensured justice was done, that upheld rule of law but also the memory of the victims there, despite his clear integrity and blemishless record—even setting all that aside, the notion that our democracy could support, our Constitution would suggest—that one party would simply say, we're not going to do our jobs because we're going to see how the election turns out to then see whether or not we should fill a vacancy in the highest court in the land gives you a sense of what's at stake in this election.\nBecause it's not just about cases and controversies that may come before the Court. It's not just about the particulars of immigration or a woman's reproductive freedom or voting rights. It's about, can our democracy work? Because the Founders anticipated that this was going to be a big, unruly place, with a lot of different points of view and a lot of people, and their whole goal was to set up a system whereby we could disagree, but maintain civil discourse and order, and that the marketplace of ideas would work and reason and fact and argument would win the day, and you'd win some arguments and you'd lose some arguments, but you'd stay true to the process. And in that fashion, self-government could work.\nIt was a big experiment, a big risk. It really hadn't been tried in the way that they imagined it and the way it unfolded over two centuries. And if you have a party that decides we're going to break that because it is not expedient at this moment, then what you've lost is more than just the possibilities of an excellent candidate being on the Supreme Court. What you've lost is the possibility that we can keep going within a set of boundaries and a framework of rules that allow us—in all of our diversity and all of our differences and all of our regional and economic and racial and religious diversity—to continue to be the greatest nation on Earth.\nNow, that's the Senate. Things are even more messed up in the House. And I said when I was in L.A. yesterday, and initially people were surprised—I said that I actually think that Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have done us a favor. People said, well, how so? This notion that Donald Trump or Ted Cruz are outliers and that now suddenly the Republican establishment wants to—they're embarrassed by them. Why? They're saying the same things that these members of the Freedom Caucus in the House have been saying for years. In fact, that's where Trump got it. He said he'd been listening apparently to their positions on immigration and their views with respect to national security and their views on slashing taxes for the wealthiest among us and slashing Medicaid and changing Medicare. And he'd been paying attention, and he said, you know what, I can deliver this message with more flair—[laughter]—with more panache.\nAnd the reason I actually think that they've done us a favor is because it has stripped away any veneer of responsible governance from what had been the central tenets of an awful lot of Republicans in both the House and the Senate during the course of my Presidency and before that.\nNow, that is different from saying that all Republicans agree with him. I think there is a substantial number of Republicans out there who are embarrassed by it. It's just that they hadn't been hearing what was being said on talk radio and FOX News and blogs and so forth. And so now there's a little bit of recoil. Is that what we're standing for? Blocking Muslims from coming into our country? Building walls? Surveilling neighborhoods?\nSo it's a useful time for us to examine what do we stand for, what do we believe, what do the parties represent. And the good news is, I know what we represent. There's a difference in emphasis between the two fine Democrats who are running for the Presidency. There are tactical differences in the assessment of how change comes about, but they both believe that climate change is real and we should do something about it. They both believe we should invest in early childhood education to give every child a chance. They both believe that we should raise the minimum wage. They both believe that we should close corporate loopholes and prevent the kind of tax avoidance that puts a burden on middle class families. They both believe that we should do something to make college more affordable. They both believe that we are a nation of immigrants and that we should pass laws that are reflective of those traditions. They both believe that women should be paid the same as men for doing the same job and that we should have family-supportive policies like affordable childcare and sick leave and family leave that can actually be used. They both believe that people should be treated with dignity and respect and full citizenship, regardless of race or religion or sexual orientation.\nThere's not this big ideological divide among Democrats. We largely agree on what we stand for. And the good news is that the majority of Americans agree with us. Now, that doesn't mean that we can be complacent. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't be self-critical. It doesn't mean we have a monopoly on wisdom. As Nancy pointed out, one of the great virtues of the Democratic Party is that it is big and encompasses a lot of different kinds of folks, and we are inherently argumentative and opinionated and self-critical. That's good. It's healthy. It can be aggravating, if you're President of the United States or the leader of the Democratic Caucus. But it's good. It's healthy.\nAnd I've said before, in ways that sometimes have gotten me in trouble with my fellow Democrats, that there are some Republican ideas—or that used to be Republican ideas until I started extolling them—[laughter]—that actually are useful. I believe in market economies. I believe in competition. I believe in entrepreneurship. I believe in making sure that regulations aren't—that we're not regulating just for the sake of regulating, but we're doing it in a way that doesn't impede growth. I want a Republican Party that is rational and well-functioning. I think that's good for our democracy.\nBut that's not what we have right now. And that's why this election is so important. Because if we are successful, not only can we advance the causes that so many of you have fought for and devoted your time and effort and energy and money to, not only do we have a chance to pass immigration reform and pass early childhood education and rebuild our infrastructure and invest in science and research and development that has been at the heart of the dynamism in our economy—not only do we have a chance to do all those things, but I actually genuinely believe it gives an opportunity for Republicans to step back and reflect on where it is that they're going.\nBut that means there's an awful lot at stake in this election. And I want to make sure that everybody here feels the same sense of urgency I do. In 10 months, I will no longer be President of the United States. But in 10 months, I will—contrary to Mr. Trump's opinion—still be a citizen of the United States. [Laughter] And I've said this before, quoting Justice Brandeis: The most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen.\nYou have all been extraordinary citizens. But the things about citizenship is it's not sporadic. You don't just do it some of the time. You don't just do it when you're particularly inspired. It is a duty and a responsibility to future generations. And I would ask that you join me and Nancy and these outstanding Members of Congress over the next 10 months to make sure that we are fulfilling our responsibilities as citizens and make sure we get a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate and a Democratic President.\nThank you very much, everybody.

Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign announced a pledged delegate total of 1,088 and released an expanded list of superdelegate supporters. The announcement is one of the many signs of the momentum building behind his grassroots campaign, including a decisive 14-point victory in Wisconsin. The senator from Vermont has now won seven out of eight primaries and caucuses.\n\"Sen. Sanders won these recent contests by large and impressive margins,\" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. \"As a result, we have cut Secretary Clinton's delegate lead by 101 since March 15, which amounts to one-third of her then-total margin. That dramatic gain leaves us only 214 delegates behind — a margin we can and fully intend to surpass by the conclusion of voting on June 14.\"\nSanders' campaign released a state-by-state delegate count that more accurately reflects the state of the race than many media reports. The discrepancy in most reports stem from the failure to account for Sanders' large victory in Washington, county level victories in the Nevada caucuses and final vote counts in Arizona. In fact, in Nevada Sanders now has a three delegate lead on Clinton.\n\"As we have pointed out since Iowa, the enthusiasm and commitment of Sen. Sanders' supporters will enable us to add delegates to our total in many caucus states as the process moves from precinct to county and then to the final state and congressional district level,\" Weaver said. \"There is no better example than the state of Nevada, where last weekend Bernie Sanders gained four delegates at county caucuses with a decisive 55 to 45 percent victory in Clark County.\"\nThe campaign also released a list of 38 superdelegates who support Sanders.\n\"Ten additional superdelegates have announced their support for in the last three weeks.

Sanders will be the strongest Democratic nominee to defeat Donald Trump or whoever the Republicans decide to nominate,\" Weaver said.\nThe latest superdelegate to announce support for Sanders is Wisconsin Democratic Party Vice Chair and state Rep. David Bowen.\nBowen announced his support the day after Sanders' big win in Wisconsin saying, \"As a superdelegate that represents Wisconsin Democrats, Wisconsin Democrats have decided by 14 point margin that they desire the political revolution Bernie Sanders speaks about. I am honored to endorse the senator and to work with the campaign in amplifying its message that has taken a hold in Wisconsin. \"\n\"We believe any accurate read of pledged delegate counts show that Sen.

Bernie Sanders on Saturday called for raising Social Security benefits to help seniors make ends meet. He also urged Hillary Clinton to back a plan endorsed by leading Democrats and seniors' advocates to strengthen the retirement program.\nSanders' stops at Bronx Community College and at the United Palace in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood were part of a presidential campaign tour of New York City boroughs.\nMore than 1,000 backers turned out to hear Sanders in Washington Heights and more than 800 supporters in the Bronx packed an auditorium in the Gould Memorial Library and an overflow room at the college.\nSanders said seniors in New York and across the United States don't have enough income to heat their homes or feed themselves and many are forced to cut their pills in half to save money on prescription drugs. \"These are the people who built this country – our parents, our grandparents. We should not be treating them that way.\"\nClinton, Sanders' rival for the Democratic Party nomination, has refused to back Sanders' plan to strengthen Social Security. In fact, Clinton has left open the possibility that she would support raising the retirement age at which seniors become eligible for Social Security. \"I would consider it,\" she told a town meeting in New Hampshire last Oct. 28.\nIn New York, more than 3.5 million seniors, orphans, widows, widowers and disabled people received Social Security benefits last year. The average annual benefit totaled only $15,000.\nWithout Social Security, more than 43 percent of the elderly in New York, including more than 48 percent of senior women, would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the elderly poverty rate in New York is 11.6 percent.\nSanders has introduced legislation to make the wealthiest Americans who make more than $250,000 a year pay the same share of their income into the retirement system as everyone else. Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $118,500.\nUnder Sanders' plan, a senior making less than $16,000 a year would see income go up by more than $1,300 a year.\nThe measure also would increase cost-of-living adjustments. This year, for only the third time in four decades, seniors on Social Security did not receive a cost-of-living increase. Sanders' legislation would increase COLAs by more accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors. Under current law, the consumer price index used to calculate annual benefit adjustments does not accurately reflect how inflation in health care costs and prescription drug prices impact seniors.\nThe proposal to lift the cap would raise taxes only on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of Americans. Sanders' plan is patterned after a proposal to scrap the cap first brought forward by President Barack Obama in 2008.\nAccording to new estimates from the Social Security Administration, Sanders' plan would extend the solvency of Social Security until the year 2074.\nThe senator from Vermont who was born and raised in Brooklyn was headed later Saturday to a third rally in Queens before capping the day with a nighttime event at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.", "timestamp": "2016-04-09", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Challenges Clinton on Social Security"}

I wasn't surprised.\nHillary has always been able to see a problem clearly and create a plan to fix it. She has never been afraid to tackle a tough issue and stick with it until she finds a solution.\nThat's probably why, from the very beginning, Hillary recognized a truth that many would rather ignore: So many of the challenges facing American families are rooted in inequality. That is why, throughout her career, she has fought for policies that address the root causes of inequality.\nThe need for her leadership on this issue has never been more urgent, especially for African Americans. The typical African American family has just 8 cents of wealth for every dollar held by a typical white family. Eight cents. And it's even less for African American women.\nThat has to change—and it starts by fighting for equal pay. That is why Hillary, as senator, helped pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\nBut equal pay is just a start. We also need to give hardworking Americans a raise.\nBack in January, my husband, Mayor Bill de Blasio, announced a $15-dollar minimum wage for all city government employees. And on Monday, our state's minimum wage was raised to $15 dollars. Now we need other states to follow our lead.\nAnd for that to happen, we need Hillary.\nIt is also high time for us to provide every American with access to paid sick leave and paid family leave. Because no one should be forced to choose between the health of their family and their next paycheck.\nDoing that won't be easy. I know because we've already done it, extending paid family leave to 20,000 city employees and sick leave to a half-million more New Yorkers.\nNow we need to make sure every family has access to these crucial resources. Doing that will take more than a vision. It will take a plan and meticulous follow up and execution.\nAnd let's not forget early childhood education—a passion that Hillary and I have long shared. Universal pre-k is in its second year here in New York City, and I know that Hillary is eager to extend universal pre-kindergarten to the rest of the country.\nBill and I have been advocating for progressive change since we worked for New York City's first mayor of color, David Dinkins, in the early ?90s. So I know what progressive looks like—and it looks like Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nIn New York City, we have a bold vision to address inequality. And we have plans to make that vision a reality. Our city and our country would benefit greatly if we had a progressive president in the White House.\nThat is why we need Hillary. No one is better prepared to help us with our mission. No one is better prepared to help our working families.\nShe has what it takes—and she won't stop until the work is done.", "timestamp": "2016-04-09", "title": "Press Release - I Know What Progressive Looks Like—and It Looks Like Hillary Rodham Clinton"}

Over the past 7 years, we haven't just been recovering from crisis, we've been rebuilding our economy on a new foundation for growth, growth that benefits everybody, not just folks at the top. Our businesses have created jobs for 73 straight months, 14.4 million new jobs in all. We've covered another 20 million Americans with health insurance. We've helped more Americans afford college and invested in industries that create good jobs that pay well, like clean energy. And wages are finally rising again.\nBut there will always be more work to do. And this week, my administration took two big steps that will help make sure your hard work is rewarded and that everybody plays by the same rules.\nFirst, we're helping more Americans retire with security and dignity. Right now if you go to a retirement adviser for investment advice, some of them don't have to act in your best interest. Instead of telling you the best way to save your hard-earned money, these advisers can get backdoor payments from big companies for steering you toward investments that cost more and earn you less. As a result, when you retire, you might be missing out on tens of thousands of dollars because your adviser got paid more to give you bad advice.\nIf that seems wrong, that's because it is. And that's why the Department of Labor just finalized a rule to crack down on these kind of conflicts of interest. And a lot of Wall Street special interests aren't very happy about it. But across the country, this new rule will boost working folks' retirement savings by billions of dollars a year. And it will level the playing field for the many good advisers who do work in their clients' best interest.\nSecond, the Treasury Department took action to crack down on big corporations that change their address overseas after acquiring smaller companies, in order to reduce their tax bill here at home. It's a loophole called corporate inversion. And it means that American companies can take advantage of American technology, America's infrastructure, America's workers, but then, when it comes to paying their fair share of taxes, suddenly claim they're not American companies after all. That's why, this week, the Treasury Department made it more difficult for companies to exploit this loophole and stick the rest of us with the tab.\nTogether, these steps build on the work we've already done to make our Tax Code fairer and consumer protections stronger. Because I believe that rather than double down on policies that allow a few at the top to play by their own rules, we should build an economy where everybody has a fair shot, everybody does their fair share, and everybody plays by the same set of rules.\nThat's what this country is all about. That's what we've been working toward these past seven years. And that's what I'm going to keep fighting for as long as I'm your President.\nThanks, everybody.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=116840", "text": "Including an extremely astute take on flying.\nHillary Clinton recently sat down for a candid conversation about the 2016 election with journalist Glenn Thrush on POLITICO's \"Off Message\" podcast.\nYou can listen to the whole hourlong conversation here—but if you're short on time, check out these five key takeaways.\n1. Hillary's philosophy about flying is a pretty good philosophy for living.\nThrush shared a memory from the press plane during Hillary's 2008 campaign: \"I was not a happy flier, and nothing ever seemed to bother you,\" he said. \"I mean, we were in some really hairy situations, and you would sleep your way through it.\"\n\"That is the answer to everything,\" Hillary responded. \"When you're facing a difficult issue that you absolutely cannot do anything about—in this case, I can't fly the plane, I can't change the weather—falling asleep, you'll either wake up and things will be fine, or you won't. ... It's been my observation that so many people worry about things that they are either ruminating over the past, which doesn't help you get the focus and energy you need to get up every day and go forward, or they're worrying about stuff that they have absolutely no control over. So I have developed that kind of philosophy in my life over the years.\"\n2. She doesn't think she's a natural politician.\nHillary admits that campaigning is hard—and it didn't come naturally to her. Even something as seemingly simple as using the pronoun \"I\" was an adjustment. \"I'm very comfortable saying, you know, ?he,' ?she,' ?we,'\" Hillary said. \"But when I had to stand up in front of people and basically say, ?I'm asking for your vote, I'm telling you what I want to do,' that took years. It absolutely took years.\"\nBut Hillary says while asking for a job is a challenge, she thrives on the job when she gets it. \"I am someone who loves doing the job that I have. I would love having the job of president because I know how to do it. I know what the country needs. But the campaigning part is hard for me. I think I've gotten better.\"\n3. She's a policy wonk—and proud of it.\n\"I really believe part of what this campaign has to do is rebuild people's faith in our national mission,\" Hillary said. \"How do we get the economy to work? How do we get the government to work? How do we get our political system to work? And I feel strongly that I owe people a clear set of ideas, and I want to lay those out.\n\"And I know that sometimes I get criticized for, ?Oh, my gosh, there she goes with another plan.' You know, ?Forget the plan, just, you know, do the rhetorical flourish.' I really believe that when this is all over—and I will have won, hopefully—in large measure it will be because I came out and told people, ?Here's what I want to do, here's how I think I can do it, here are the results I believe I can get, and I want you to hold me accountable for it.' I think that's what politics should be about, so I'm very comfortable doing that.\"\nHillary's right—she does have a lot of plans. Explore them here.\n4. She's ready to stand up to bullies—and that includes the Republican candidates for president.\nSpeaking about \"mean-spirited\" Republican candidates in this election, Hillary reflected: \"We can have differences. Look, I'm well-aware that it's a contact sport. I understand that. But when it gets right down to it, you've got to offer Americans your credentials, because it's a huge interviewing and hiring process. And people have to decide, ?What do I know about this person? Is this the person I want in the Oval Office? Is this the person I want to be both president and Commander-in-Chief?' And that requires a level of dialogue and debate that is civil, that does have a purpose to it other than just, you know, making a point.\"\n5. She's fighting to fix income inequality—and every other kind of inequality.\n\"I don't think any right that we have is less important than any other issue,\" Hillary said. \"You know, I have said repeatedly, ?I am going to attack income inequality,' and I think I have a pretty good plan to do so. I don't just tell you what I'm against. I tell you what I'm for and how I would do it.\n\"But there are other forms of inequality. There is desperate education inequality in America, and I think every kid deserves a good teacher and a good school regardless of the ZIP code that he or she lives in. Racial inequality, sexual orientation inequality, gender inequality. So when somebody says, ?Yeah, yeah, it's important, but let's talk about the really important issues. Don't let us get distracted from hearing the same thing we've heard now, over and over again about income inequality,' that bothers me, and I did speak out about it.\"", "timestamp": "2016-04-10", "title": "Press Release - Hillary Clinton Went \"Off Message.\" Here's What We Learned"}

It is a danger to the air we breathe. It has resulted in more earthquakes. It is highly explosive. And it is contributing to climate change,\" Sanders told 5,000 supporters inside Veterans Memorial Arena here in the Southern Tier region of New York known as the \"fracking belt.\"\nNew York and Sanders' home state of Vermont have banned fracking. There's a moratorium on the drilling technique in Maryland. \"I want to applaud you for standing up to Gov. Cuomo and demanding that New York state ban fracking,\" Sanders told the audience. But he added: \"If we are serious, we need to put an end to fracking not only in New York and Vermont but all over this country.\"\nThe toxic chemicals used in fracking are known to cause cancer and birth defects, he said. \"We cannot, we must not allow our children to be poisoned by toxic drinking water just so a handful of fossil fuel companies can make even more profits,\" Sanders added.\nSanders also noted that Clinton promoted fracking overseas when she was secretary of state. He called their records on fracking and other environmental issues one of the \"very important differences\" between the candidates for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.\nHe also noted other differences with Clinton on climate change and the environment. Sanders led the fight to stop the Keystone XL pipeline to transport \"some of the dirtiest fuel on the planet\" from Canada's tar sands region to Gulf Coast refineries. She was a latecomer to opposing the controversial pipeline's construction. He has introduced legislation calling for a carbon tax to discourage use of greenhouse-gas emitting fossil fuels that cause climate change. She doesn't support a carbon tax. He consistently opposed offshore drilling. Clinton has not. He would end leases for the extraction of fossil fuel on public lands. Clinton would not.\n\"If we are going to leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable for future generations we need bold action now,\" Sanders said.\nMeanwhile, the new TV ad released Monday was called \"No Fracking Anywhere.\"\n\"Do Washington politicians side with polluters over families?\" asks Susan Sarandon in the 30-second spot. \"They sure do, because Big Oil pumps millions into their campaigns. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate for president who opposes fracking everywhere.\"\nAccording to public records and disclosures, $1 of every $15 contributed to the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action came from fossil fuel interests.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117321", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:04 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I hope you all had a good weekend. As advertised, we are going to do a follow-up to the Zika briefing that we did at the top of a briefing here a couple of months ago. So I'm joined once again by Dr. Anne Schuchat from the Centers for Disease Control, and Dr. Tony Fauci, from the National Institute of Health. Both of them will be able to provide you with an update on some additional information that we have learned about this virus and the risk that it poses to the American public. They'll also be able to provide us some additional information about the funding request that the administration put forward to the United States Congress a couple of months ago.\nAs we discussed in the briefing last week, we have not seen the kind of response from Congress that we would expect, and frankly, we haven't seen the kind of response from Congress that is clearly in the interest of the safety and well-being of the American people. And so both Dr. Schuchat and Dr. Fauci should be able to provide you some insight into how those resources will be used.\nEach of them will make brief opening statements, and then for questions on this topic, we'll do those at the top so that they can answer them and then we'll let them go. And we can discuss the wide array of other topics that are likely to come up today.\nSo, Dr. Schuchat, why don't I turn it over to you first?\nDR. SCHUCHAT: Thanks so much. It's a pleasure to be here today. Since we last discussed the Zika virus, we continue to be learning pretty much every day, and most of what we're learning is not reassuring. We have learned that the virus is linked to a broader set of complications in pregnancy, not just the microcephaly, but also prematurity, eye problems and some other conditions. We have learned that the mosquito vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is present in a broader range of states in the continential U.S.. So instead of about 12 states where the mosquito, Aedes aegypti is present, we believe about 30 states have the mosquito present.\nWe've also learned that the virus is likely to be a problem at much of the pregnancy period, not just probably the first trimester but potentially throughout the pregnancy. This information is, of course, of concern, and CDC has been working 24/7 to protect pregnant women, to support the state and local health departments that are that front line of defense, to learn as much as we can about the mosquito that can spread the virus and about the virus itself, and to work with other countries to learn what we may be seeing later in the continental U.S.\nWe are quite concerned about Puerto Rico, where the virus is spreading throughout the island. We think there could be hundreds of thousands of cases of Zika virus in Puerto Rico, and perhaps hundreds of affected babies. We know that the pregnant women in Puerto Rico are very keen to protect themselves and to have community protection, and we're working closely with the authorities in Puerto Rico to support that response with mosquito control beginning and with the distribution of what we call Zika prevention kits for pregnant women.\nWe've learned that mosquito transmission is the usual way that the virus can spread, but it also appears to be spread through sexual transmission, and that has meant we've had to issue updated guidance for couples on how to prevent spread of the virus, particularly to pregnant women.\nThe other thing that we've learned is that there is a resounding interest in preventing this disease and controlling it as well as we can. Last week -- or on April 1st, the CDC and U.S. government convened a Zika Action Plan summit in Atlanta. Leaders from more than 30 states and territories joined in Atlanta to do Zika action planning to get ready for mosquito season. There's a lot to do to increase laboratory diagnostic testing, to increase mosquito surveillance, to increase human surveillance and birth defect surveillance, and to improve our communication so people have the best information to protect themselves and their families.\nSo that's what's been going on since we talked a couple weeks ago. And I'll turn things over to Dr. Fauci.\nDR. FAUCI: Thank you very much, Anne. And in a similar vein, since we spoke last, at the same week that the CDC had their summit in Atlanta we had a research meeting on Monday and Tuesday of that same week right in Rockville and North Bethesda. And to underscore what Dr. Schuchat said, we're learning more and more about this, and I'm just giving you a very brief summary about that, but the more and more we learn, the more and more you get concerned about the scope of what this virus is doing. Bottom line is we still have a lot to learn.\nThe first thing was a very important study at the very fine, molecular level, looking at the virus and seeing if it is any different from dengue -- because the question we keep asking it's a flavivirus; it's transmitted by the same mosquito. What is the difference between Zika and dengue? And it looks really very much the same molecularly, except there's a very short, small run of amino acids -- namely, the building blocks of protein -- at the part of the virus that binds to cells. So it may be that that's the clue of why it acts different, particularly being neurotropic, or being -- having a propensity to infect neurological tissue.\nGood news is that we developed two animal models, two mouse models since we spoke last. And again, the mouse models underscore what Dr. Schuchat said, because when you infect a mouse, there's a very strong propensity to infect neurological tissue. We've developed a monkey model, which is interesting because the monkey now -- you can get a monkey pregnant and look at the difference between the virus in a pregnant monkey and a monkey who's not pregnant.\nAnd what we've seen -- and this is just preliminary data but it's really quite scintillating -- is that the virus stays around the blood significantly longer in the pregnant monkey than it does in the non-pregnant. And the reason that's important -- you might remember we had a case here of a Washington resident who was infected during pregnancy, affected the fetus, and that person had weeks of viremia, which is very unusual because viremia only usually lasts a couple of days.\nAgain, the neurological issues are important. In vitro studies of getting the virus and putting it in neural stem cells showing that it has a very strong propensity to destroy tissue, which could explain why besides interfering with the development of a fetus, it might directly attack brain tissue, even when the fetus is later on in the period of gestation.\nWe also are continuing with the vaccine studies that I mentioned to you. I told you that we would very likely have our first vaccine candidate in phase one in September. That looks like it's on time. We're producing it in our pilot plant outside of Bethesda, and we're going to then be processing it to be able to get it through the FDA to put into a human.\nAnd then finally, we have a screening program for drugs that I mentioned to you. We hadn't screened any drugs the last time we spoke; we've now screened about 62 drugs and have 15 of them that have some degree of activity. Caution: That doesn't mean they're going to turn out to be good drugs, but they do have some activity.\nSo in summary, a lot of things have gone on, things that are pointing to serious issues that we need to address. But we've learned an awful lot since we spoke, and we really do need to learn a lot more. Because this is a very unusual virus that we can't even pretend that we know everything about it that we need to know.\nThank you.\nQ: Thank you. Doctor, you mentioned you expected there to be hundreds of thousands of cases in Puerto Rico. Do you have a prediction or a range of how many you expect in the United States broadly?\nDR. SCHUCHAT: You know, much of our predictions come from what we saw with dengue virus and chikungunya virus, and those two viruses are also spread by the same mosquito. In Puerto Rico, they ranged between 25 and 80 percent of the population getting infected with one or the other of those viruses over the course of one or multiple seasons.\nIn the continental U.S., those -- we have seen travel-associated cases of chikungunya and dengue. We haven't seen large numbers, we haven't seen thousands of cases of locally transmitted disease from the mosquitoes. We've seen dozens of cases. But we absolutely need to be ready.\nAs Dr. Fauci was saying, everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought. And so while we absolutely hope we don't see widespread local transmission in the continental U.S., we need the states to be ready for that. And that was part of what our summit was about -- learning all they could about mosquito control, what do we know, what do we now know, what can we do with the tools that we have today, and how to get ready for mosquito season; when they have a case of travel-associated, how to look around that individual for the mosquitoes nearby.\nWe really want the traveling public, when they come back from the Caribbean or Latin America, to use repellant for the couple weeks after they return, because if they silently got Zika infection and they get bit by a mosquito in the continental U.S., that mosquito can then spread the virus.\nSo I don't expect there to be large outbreaks in the continental U.S. I can't give a number to how many cases, but I can say that we can't assume we're not going to have a big problem. We know with other viruses we've had bigger problems than we expected, so we're taking this very seriously.\nQ: And that number is for regions in the world?\nDR. SCHUCHAT: What we know from the other viruses is that 25 to 80 percent of the population may get the infection. We know, for instance, in Puerto Rico right now they're have dengue virus, as well as the Zika virus at the same time. So that makes it even more difficult to tease out what's causing a person's fever and rash. So I would say that in Latin America we know they're at risk for very high attack rates of the virus.\nIn terms of pregnant women, we don't know yet when you have Zika virus infection during pregnancy, what percent of the time the baby will be totally normal and what percent of the time there will be a complication. That's one of the most important questions for us to answer, and teams are working in Colombia, in Brazil, in Panama trying to answer that question, because that's the most important question for pregnant women.\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Dr. Fauci, two for you. One, can you tell me more about the Zika prevention kits and what that entails? And for Dr. Schuchat, how concerned should American athletes be that may be traveling to Brazil, especially as the Olympics come? Are we working on something specifically for Americans that may have it? And I guess I should ask you also another one, Dr. Fauci, about resources. Are you confident that you have what you need to maintain this --\nDR. FAUCI: Well, I'll answer that question and get the prevention kit to Dr. Schuchat, because that is a CDC thing. The answer is, I don't have what I need right now. What I've done is take money from other areas of non-Zika research to start. We couldn't just stop and wait for the money; we had to go ahead for it. The only trouble is, if we don't get the money that the President has asked for, we're not going to be able to take it to the point where we've actually accomplished what we need to do. So the answer is, we really don't have what we need, but we're still going full blast by drawing money from other areas, and that's how we started. The money that's being transferred over from the Ebola account will help bring us a little bit further, but it's still not what we want. When the President asked for $1.9 billion, we needed $1.9 billion.\nDR. SCHUCHAT: The Zika prevention kits are being given out to pregnant women in the areas where the virus is already spreading. So in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, there have been about 5,000 kits distributed so far. They include insect repellant. They include information about how women can protect themselves. They include condoms, because we know that the virus can be spread sexually, not just through mosquitos. They include vouchers for screening materials to help people make sure the mosquitos stay outside the home and not inside the home, and those sorts of things.\nWe actually initially were considering putting in some permethrin-treated clothing, but then some of our surveillance for mosquito resistance in Puerto Rico revealed that permethrin probably isn't effective, so we didn't end up including that kind of treated clothing. But they're essentially materials and information to help women protect themselves.\nIn terms of the athletes, we know the Olympics is just a wonderful event and that athletes have been training for their whole lives to go there. We really want to make sure people know that if they're pregnant, they should defer travel. We also want people to know that travel to the area may lead to silent infections or infections with symptoms, and that following infections it's very important to take precautions during sex not to spread the virus. So that type of information has been shared with the Olympic Committee, and of course the CDC is working closely with the Olympic Medical Committee about further advice.\nMR. EARNEST: Angela.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. For the doctors, are you concerned that by transferring the money from the already appropriated funds last week, that it reduces the urgency on Congress to appropriate new funds?\nDR. FAUCI: Well, it shouldn't, because as I just said, it is not enough for us to get the job done. I mean, it's just a temporary stopgap. If you look at what we need to do both at the CDC and at the NIH, we have a lot of work to do, and that may, in some people's minds, kind of lessen the intensity of it. But in our minds, it doesn't, because we still don't have enough to do what we need to do.\nDR. SCHUCHAT: I was just going to say that we also feel a sense of urgency about Ebola and the global health security agenda. Ebola is still circulating in Liberia and Guinea, and many of the vulnerable countries in Africa are having outbreaks right now. And so we know that we have to be, as a country, ready to support response to more than one outbreak at a time. We think that's really important. So we're working as quickly and as deeply as we can on the Zika response, while continuing to support Ebola response and recovery.\nQ: We heard the Zika virus is coming to the United States, expecting it summer or fall. Is there any sort of mosquito forecast, any way of knowing if it's going to be a worse year than usual for mosquitos in general? And also, what are you telling travelers, people who are going to some of these countries and returning? Should they be tested? And where can that be done?\nDR. SCHUCHAT: The issue of mosquito surveillance and prediction is a really great question. And one of the problems in the past decade or so is that we've really let our mosquito control efforts wither away, and so we don't have the great information that we'd like to have, or even the ability to do better modeling about where in the country the problems are going to be and when they might occur. So strengthening mosquito surveillance before you have to get human disease is a priority for us. So that is something that we're working on. And I think with more resources, we could do a better job.\nI'm forgetting what the second part of the question was.\nQ: Testing --\nDR. SCHUCHAT: Oh, testing people -- right. Yeah, we do think that if you come back from an area where Zika is spreading and you're pregnant, we recommend that you be tested whether you were symptomatic or not. We recommend testing in the first trimester and again in the third trimester. In terms of people who don't have symptoms, we don't think they need to be tested -- who aren't pregnant -- but we think that they do need to take precautions with sexual contact, particularly in terms of sex with a pregnant woman. And so we've put out updated guidance on that.\nWe know a lot of couples were asking, well, I'm not pregnant but I want to get pregnant, and how long do I have to wait? So we put out guidance on that as well, about waiting an eight-week period following travel before trying to conceive for women. And waiting a longer period for men who have symptoms, or in terms of the potential that men can have persistent virus in the semen.\nQ: Dr. Schuchat, you think these Zika prevention kits would be useful in mainland United States? And also, do you have any projection on the spread of the Zika virus in Puerto Rico? And to Dr. Fauci, what happens when the stopgap runs out?\nDR. SCHUCHAT: Yes, we do think the Zika prevention kits may be helpful in some part of the U.S. And there was a lot of interest in them from the state health departments that attended the summit. One of the issues to consider is the living conditions -- do people have screens, do they have air conditioning. We heard that in parts of Key West it's very similar to Puerto Rico -- people like the windows open and they like that breeze. And so that idea of protecting yourself from mosquitos that can live inside the house may be relevant here.\nAnd then the second question -- it was for you. Okay, good.\nQ: And projection of the spread in Puerto Rico.\nDR. SCHUCHAT: Right. We've got a team working closely in Puerto Rico trapping mosquitos and looking at where the mosquitos are that are potentially of concern. They're also testing for resistance, and then the human surveillance. And we are seeing it in multiple parts of the island. And it may be that the cases we're seeing reported on just a small percentage because we think some people can be asymptomatic -- not have symptoms. And the only people that are being tested right now are people who come in with symptoms.\nSo we're seeing it increasing across the island. And we're worried that as it gets even warmer, it's going to be island-wide.\nDR. FAUCI: To be honest here, I can't imagine that we're not going to be given the money when we've reached the point where every time we come in front of you, we tell you things that are more serious. So if we reach the point where the stopgap money runs out, again, hopefully that will never happen, but we're going to have to start raiding other accounts. And very important research on other diseases is going to suffer, and suffer badly.\nSo I just almost can't imagine that that would happen, because as we keep talking more, I mean, we just spoke to you about the very interesting issue that we're learning. Again, I'm not an alarmist, and most of you who know me know that I'm not. But the more we learn about the neurological aspects, the more we look around and say, this is very serious. I mean, just in the last couple of weeks, we know not only do you have Guillain-Barrй, but you have a case of an acute myelitis, you have a meningoencephalitis.\nAnd then you have this new thing that was just recently described -- we need to get more of the cases that it really is associated -- called, ADEM, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, which is a multiple sclerosis-type of an involvement in the brain. Thankfully, it tends to resolve the way Guillain-Barrй resolves. But again, every time we look, we see more and more.\nSo in the context of your question, I can't imagine, as we learn more and more things that are troublesome, that all of a sudden we're not going to get the money. We really do have to get it.\nMR. EARNEST: Bill.\nQ: Dr. Fauci, how did this seem to catch us so by surprise?\nDR. FAUCI: It caught us by surprise not in the sense of what we should of known -- because for essentially, since the virus was first recognized in 1947 and the first human cases were 1952, it was a relatively inconsequential virus in the sense of a rather mild illness, virtually no mortality, no hints or signals of other things that we're seeing now. For example, the microcephaly, the congenital abnormalities, or Guillain-Barrй.\nAnd what happened? And we don't have all the answers to this -- when it then had its first outbreak, and the first outbreak was in the Yap Islands, that when things started to explode. And we still didn't get all the information from them. And only when it hit a vulnerable, big population with a lot of mosquitos, with people who have never exposed to this before, did we then start seeing the unfolding of this scenario that every week, every month, it tends to surprise us even more. But the initial part of it, there was really no reason to be very suspicious that this would be bad. It was one of those viruses that just gave a mild illness.\nQ: With the $1.9 billion that House Chairman Rogers said that -- they plan to continue to monitor this and then fund it as needed. Why is that approach not appropriate for this virus? Why do you need that $1.9 billion up front as a big bulk of money versus getting it as this progresses and it goes forward? And when is it going to be too late? Is it the first bite of local transmission? Or is it some other point when you start to see those numbers swell?\nDR. SCHUCHAT: I think, as Dr. Fauci said, we haven't been waiting for the money to act, because this is so serious. We've been surging our laboratory testing, for instance -- there's a big backlog on that laboratory testing. To really scale up takes time.\nAnd so knowing that resources are coming helps with the scale-up. There are a lot of commercial partners that are needed for that scale-up. Will they actually help without knowing that resources are coming? The vector control -- yes, we have enough money to start on that, but that's an expensive undertaking, the mosquito-control efforts. And, as I said, we're learning that not all the chemicals or pesticides that are out there will work.\nThere are multi-year studies that are going to be needed for these babies. Because we really don't know whether a child that looks healthy at birth will actually not have the effect of the Zika virus. So there's longer-term studies that are going to be needed.\nSo what I would say is that people are acting intensively right now, but that we can't -- if additional resources aren't coming, we won't be able to commit to the long-term work that's needed.\nThen the other thing is the places that the resources were taken from were areas where important work was going on. And I think we're quite vulnerable if we're not able to meet the commitments on the global health security or the Ebola response and recovery.\nDR. FAUCI: Yes, just -- what Anne said, but also, something that I mentioned to this group the last time we were here, that we have a very important partnership with pharmaceutical companies. And if they don't perceive us as a reliable partner, they tend to back off a bit. And that would be the worst thing, because we won't be able to develop these countermeasures completely on our own. So we need to partner with them. And they would get mistrustful if we say, okay, trust us, we'll give you the money later. That doesn't work in industry -- \"Trust us, we'll give you the money later.\"\nQ: Are you seeing any hesitation from industry partners since that money hasn't come through yet?\nDR. FAUCI: Well, the answer is, thankfully, not yet. But I have considerable experience -- as some of you may have remembered, back in the time when we were building countermeasures for bio-defense, when we were trying to get vaccines for anthrax and things like that -- we were trying to bring companies in, and unless we really had the money up front, that they knew that we were going to be a reliable partner. Many of the important companies backed out. I really don't want to see that now when we need a vaccine and other countermeasures so desperately.\nQ: The other part of my question was, when will it be too late?\nDR. SCHUCHAT: We held our summit with the health departments on April 1st because we know that mosquito season is coming and we didn't want to wait for money for them to get plans done. But they're going to need to actually develop mosquito-control efforts, surveillance and a lot of difficult tasks.\nSo knowing that there is some resources now is helpful. They're frustrated because some of the resources are coming from other programs that they have.\nThe problem here is that the mosquitoes come, people get infected, and then it's several months before the baby is born. And we're really trying to protect every pregnant woman we can right now. So we have this double whammy of you see the febrile illness now; you'll see the horrible effects on the child many months from now. And we don't want to wait for that, we need to act before then.\nQ: First question, Dr. Fauci. You said in the beginning that you were moving money around right now. Where is that money coming from? And the second question is, is there abstinence information in the Zika kits?\nDR. FAUCI: Okay. With regard to the moving money around, when you have -- the fiscal year is going to end at the end of September, and we have money that's planned for other things -- that could be malaria, that could be tuberculosis -- and we have that money that is going to go into the projects that are going to just continue to progress the way they are. We're taking that money and now spending it on Zika, and if we don't refurbish that money, those programs are going to stop when they reach the point when they run out of money.\nSo that's what I mean. What we're trying to do is keep everything going. But you reach a point when you don't come in and backfill it that things stop. And that's what I was referring to -- of my concern.\nQ: What are those programs?\nDR. FAUCI: Well, there are several. I can tell you what we likely would do -- one of them would be malaria, the other thing would be universal flu vaccine, the other one would be tuberculosis. Things like that.\nDR. SCHUCHAT: The guidance that we've issued for pregnant women and for couples in terms of preventing the sexual spread of Zika virus include both condoms and abstinence. The actual wording in the materials for Puerto Rico I'm not sure of, because I know we were doing focus testing for the appropriate way to message.\nQ: Dr. Fauci, can you tell us a little more about -- rightfully, you insist about women want to become pregnant and pregnancy -- can you just tell us a little more about neurological disorder, the Guillan-Barrй Syndrome? And how dangerous is it for the rest of the population? And at what point will it be necessary to tell people, try to avoid going south?\nDR. FAUCI: Okay. So I'll address the part about the neurological and then I'll have Dr. Schuchat talk about what recommendations likely may or may not come out.\nThe issue is we're seeing these case reports of things that we had not seen before with other similar viruses. I mentioned the acute myelitis in a young person, an 81-year-old man who developed meningoencephalitis, and now the two cases of what they're calling ADEM. We don't know what the denominator is of that. So that's the reason why you do these prospective cohort studies and you do surveillance studies, which the CDC and others are trying to get exactly what is the extent of that? Are these just outlier cases, or when you look very carefully, are you going to see a lot of them?\nThe concern we're having is that at the same time we're seeing the clinical manifestations in people, everything that we do in an animal model or in an in-vitro cell line is bad news. The most recent of -- one, when they put Zika virus into neural stem cells, they have these things called organoids, which are kind of a psudo-brain formation, get completely destroyed by the Zika virus. And then they have a variety of other things that are related to the neurological system. It appears to be very toxically neurotropic, and that's the thing that's concerning.\nHow that relates to how many of the clinical cases we'll see, we just have to keep our surveillance up.\nDR. SCHUCHAT: Just in terms of the additional travel guidance, we base our updated guidance on the best information we have. At this point, we have enhanced travel recommendations for pregnant women, saying that they defer travel or consider deferring travel. I can't promise that we would never have broader recommendations, but we'll base it on the best information we have.\nSo far, Guillain-Barrй Syndrome in the background, or the general population, is fairly rare. If this is truly causing an increase, it still may be relatively uncommon, and so an individual needs that information, but it may not lead to us saying \"Don't go.\"\nMR. EARNEST: John, I'll give you the last one then we'll let the doctors go.\nQ: Okay, thank you, Josh. Dr. Schuchat, you mentioned spread of the epidemic in Puerto Rico, its seriousness. Now there have been reports from Haiti that it's growing very seriously, and that the problem is compounded by a reluctance of people to report and say what problem they have at medical centers. What precisely are you doing with Haiti, given its proximity to the United States?\nDR. SCHUCHAT: Yes. You know, Haiti is a key country for us. We've been working closely with authorities in Haiti since before the earthquake and following the earthquake on intensive support for the public health system there. We share a concern about Haiti, though -- the mosquitoes are there, the virus is there, and the population is quite vulnerable.\nAnd so we do have a CDC country office in Haiti that's working together with the authorities. It's essentially the same principle as what we're doing in Puerto Rico -- that people need to be protected against mosquitoes, particularly pregnant women. And of course, care is not really going to be as strong there. We don't have specific treatment, but you know if you got Guillain-Barrй Syndrome in Haiti, it would be quite difficult.\nSo we share the concern and are working with our CDC counterparts there.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, Doctors, for coming. Nice to see you.\nAll right. Hopefully all that is useful. And I suspect it's probably not the last time that we'll have Doctors Schuchat and Fauci here to talk to us about this important issue. But hopefully, it also is -- serves as motivation for members of Congress to pay careful attention to this top priority.\nSo with that, though, Kathleen, we can get back to our regularly scheduled programming here.\nQ: I wanted to check on two topics. First, we have a story out today about an AP FOIA request that was related to USAID's Twitter operation in Cuba -- I don't know if you've seen that story --\nMR. EARNEST: I've heard about it.\nQ: Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: I anticipated you may ask about it. (Laughter.)\nQ: So AP got some emails that they requested via FOIA last week, and that's two years after the FOIA was filed. And the story quotes a former USAID official saying that the organization sort of planned on this delay as a way to manage the fallout (inaudible) the program. And I'm just wondering how that kind of two-year delay squares with the administration's claim that it's the most transparent in history, and if you have any concerns that agencies are sort of intentionally using delays to slow-walk requests, and that some requests become basically useless because the information is returned two years later.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, as we've discussed in a much more high-profile setting, the individual agencies are responsible for responding to individual Freedom of Information Act requests that they receive from journalists or members of the public.\nBut the guidelines the administration has put forward make clear that a genuine effort to have a bias toward openness and transparency is the approach that we would expect agencies to use when fulfilling these requests. Obviously, they have a wide range of factors to consider when being responsive to Freedom of Information Act requests, but last year I think is a pretty good measure that 91 percent of the responses that were provided to Freedom of Information Act requests included some or all of the information that was requested. That's an indication that across the administration, the response that you see is consistent with the approach that the administration as a whole strongly supports.\nI can't speak to the details of this particular case, because, ultimately, it was the responsibility of that agency to comply with that request. I don't know what merited a two-year delay, or whether or not a two-year delay actually was merited. But I'd refer you to the agency for the answer to that precise question.\nQ: Okay. And separately, I wanted to go back to a comment the President made in the Fox News Sunday interview that ran yesterday. He said his worst mistake was \"probably failing to plan for the day after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in Libya.\" And I just wondered if you could kind of expand on that. It was only sort of one sentence, but it seemed sort of meaningful. What exactly does he see as his mistake? And who does he blame for it? And is he saying that he personally should have done more planning, or the U.S. should have done more planning with allies? Or what exactly is the gist of that?\nMR. EARNEST: The President talked about this issue a little bit more in his most recent address to the United Nations at the General Assembly there. In that speech, the President noted that \"Our coalition\" -- I'm quoting now -- \"could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind.\"\nObviously, the situation in Libya was quite unique. You had the Qaddafi regime massing forces prepared to carry out an act of violence against a substantial and defenseless population. And the international community, led by the United States, responded to prevent a good portion of that violence. And that obviously was a good thing. Lives were saved. Many lives were saved.\nBut what is also true, and what is unique to Libya, is that they had a totalitarian dictator in power for 42 years. And the civil society and governing structures of that country atrophied. And it meant that once that dictator had been removed from power, that the regular structures that are typically in place in a country were not there to govern the country, or to at least ensure some measure of stability in that country until a government could be rebuilt and until security could be restored.\nSo the unique confluence of events -- the need for emergent action on the part of the international community -- and governing structures that just didn't exist led to a scenario where the right decision was made at the beginning to prevent significant loss of life, at least in that specific instance. But the rest of the international community did not have time and did not succeed in following through with the plan to compensate for the vacuum that was left behind.\nAnd I think in some ways you could say that the President has tried to apply this lesson in considering the use of military in other circumstances; that asking the question about what situation will prevail and what sort of commitments from the international community will be required after that military intervention has been ordered by the Commander-in-Chief.\nAnd that I think, looking back, at least in the words of the President in his conversation with Mr. Wallace, is something that he regrets that the United States and the rest of the members of our coalition didn't do as it pertains to Libya.\nQ: And on that sort of notion then, Secretary Carter said that the President is going to be asking for more money to help stabilize, rebuild -- economic aid for Iraq when he goes to this Gulf conference next week. I'm wondering, is that part of what he's going to do there? Do you have any details on how much aid? And is this part of some -- getting a more solid long-term commitment from allies?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President is traveling to Saudi Arabia next week, where he will be meeting with many of our GCC partners who are making important contributions to our counter-ISIL coalition. The focal point of our strategy all along has been building up the capacity of the government in Iraq, and eventually the government in Syria, to unite the country to confront the threat that they face from extremists. And there will be a series of discussions about what additional steps our coalition can take to press the case against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. And I'm confident that there will be a discussion about what additional commitments our GCC partners, in particular, can make to that ongoing effort. I don't have any details about that conversation to preview right now, but that's certainly something that we can talk about a little bit more next week.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, why is the President meeting with Fed Chair Yellen today? What does he expect to get out of that meeting and what is the reason for the timing of it?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, the President has met periodically over the last couple of years with Fed Chair Janet Yellen. This is not something that they do regularly. I think the last one-on-one meeting they had was in late 2014, so it's been a little more than a year since they had a one-on-one meeting. Chair Yellen did participate in the meeting that the President convened earlier this year with financial regulators across the government. And obviously, the Fed plays an important regulatory role, and she participated in the meeting, accordingly.\nThe goal of the conversation I think, frankly, is just to discuss the current trajectory of the U.S. economy but also the global economy. I'm confident that there will be an additional discussion of some regulatory issues, as well. And the President has talked quite a bit about how his top domestic priority is expanding economic opportunity for the middle class, and obviously pursuing that policy priority involves having a sort of broad understanding of current economic conditions. Obviously, Chair Yellen spends a lot of time examining those conditions and making her own independent policy decisions. And so it's an opportunity for them in some ways to trade notes on something that they're both looking at quite carefully even if the Fed Chair will continue to make the kinds of independent decisions that we believe are critical to the successful functioning of our economy.\nQ: A long process went into the President's decision to appoint Janet Yellen a couple years ago. Is he happy with that choice?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's an interesting question. I certainly don't want to say something that would implicitly call into question her independence. But I think the President has been pleased with the way that she has fulfilled what is a critically important job, both as it relates to making policy decisions that have a significant impact not just on the U.S. economy but on the global economy, but also making sure that the Fed is following through on the important regulatory responsibilities that they have.\nSo, hopefully, I didn't leave anybody with the impression that there is anything less than the utmost respect for the independent nature of her role in the decisions that she must make. But I think that, independently, people across the ideological spectrum, at least when it comes to politics, would acknowledge that she has filled this very important role quite well.\nQ: And separately, is the White House concerned about the state of events in Ukraine after the Prime Minister stepped down on Sunday -- concerned about the pace of reform that otherwise was going on there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, the administration has been concerned about the situation in Ukraine for quite some time now. And obviously, Mr. Yatsenyuk has played an important role throughout this process. As his country has gone through such significant turmoil, he's played an important role in trying to help his country weather those challenges, and he obviously has been an important partner with the United States as we have tried to provide support to our friends in Ukraine.\nThis would explain why the Vice President of the United States telephoned Mr. Yatsenyuk yesterday. And we obviously are pleased that he has indicated he will remain on to ensure a smooth transition to his successor.\nImplementing key economic reforms in Ukraine is going to be critical to that nation's long-term success, and the economic environment in that country right now is different and has certainly not been aided by the actions of the Russians to destabilize that country and to violate their territorial integrity.\nSo the people of Ukraine and the nation of Ukraine is enduring quite a lot. The United States will continue to stand with them and support them as they endure these challenges. But that also means that the government of Ukraine will need to follow through on the critical economic reforms of which you alluded to, and we're hopeful that the commitment to implementing those reforms will continue in the mind of Mr. Yatsenyuk's successor.\nBill.\nQ: When did the administration begin its review of the declassification of the so-called \"28 pages,\" the last chapter of the 9/11 Report?\nMR. EARNEST: Bill, for the details related to the declassification process I'd actually refer you to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. His office is responsible for these kinds of declassification exercises, and they'll make the necessary decisions about which of the materials and how much of the materials can be declassified.\nI think the President has made clear that trying to prevent bureaucratic over-classification is something that we've identified as a policy priority. And there are a number of steps that we have taken in recent years to make clear that that is a priority even in a national security context where classified material -- preserving classified material is entirely legitimate.\nA couple of examples of that -- the first is the administration did support the declassification of the key elements of the Senate's report on the former CIA interrogation program. This is what's often referred to as the RDI report. And there was a vigorous debate both in the intelligence community but also in Congress about whether or not key elements of that report should be declassified, and the administration did support the release of a declassified version of that report.\nThe other example that I can cite -- and this is something that we've been talking about for the last few weeks -- which is the commitment that the administration has made to making public instances in which noncombatants are killed in counterterrorism operations overseas. There's some more work to be done on this, but this is something that Lisa Monaco, the President's top counterterrorism advisor, discussed in a speech recently. And so we would anticipate that we'll have more news about how that information will be released in the coming weeks.\nBut I think it does reflect the important progress that we've made over the course of the administration. You'll recall, Bill, that in the early years of this administration that individuals who were standing where I'm standing wouldn't even acknowledge that those counterterrorism operations were taking place. But now you have a situation where the administration is laying out a key system for not just acknowledging that those operations took place, but also disclosing more detail about the consequences of those actions.\nQ: Back to this particular case. Do you know when the declassification effort began? Because in the NSC statement today, they say that they hope to have it done by the end of the administration. How long is it supposed to take when you have members of the 9/11 Commission, at least three of them, and two former members of intelligence committees, and according to former Congressman Roemer, even the Saudis say that it should be declassified?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Bill, I haven't seen the 28 pages and I don't know what they contain, so I'm just not in a position to explain what the factors are in their ongoing review. I don't know when that process began.\nQ: -- it will take until the end of the administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, it may, but without having seen those materials it's hard for me to explain whether it will or why it would if it does come to that. I mean, because you did mention the 9/11 Commission -- there is an independent investigation that was conducted into 9/11. You had experts who had previously served in government who led this effort, and they did release a report that was declassified. So we do have -- when I say \"we,\" I mean the public does have a lot of insight into what led to the attacks of 9/11 and what steps were taken to try to counter -- prevent it from happening again.\nQ: But I think the last chapter of that report was never really --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a separate report. This is a report that was put together by Congress. And, yes, that report has not been released, but it is currently being reviewed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for a potential release. But I just don't have an update on their ongoing efforts.\nQ: Does the President support the release of this?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that the President has reviewed those 28 pages. I can tell you that the President certainly does support being as transparent as possible, but he also believes that these national security officials have an important job to do to make sure that if secrets need to be kept that they can be. So I don't know that the President has voiced an opinion in this particular case, but we can check on that.\nQ: If all of these people who have read the report -- or many of them -- suggest that it should be released, then what's the hang-up? I mean, these are people who have seen the classified information, they know what's in it, and according to Roemer, even the Saudi government supports it. So why the hang-up?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Bill, I think that we have seen -- there have been some high-profile examples in the news recently of how well-intentioned, patriotic national security professionals can arrive at different conclusions about what information can be made public without damaging our national security, and what information must be withheld. And this is always part of a vigorous bureaucratic debate. And I know that \"bureaucratic\" often has a negative connotation. I don't necessarily mean it that way. I just mean that there are well-intentioned individuals with different points of view who can arrive at different conclusions, or at least engage in a debate that leaves them on different sides of that debate about what information can be made public without risking U.S. national security.\nAnd I can't speak to the nature of the debate in this instance because I haven't read the 28 pages, but the President is certainly hopeful that this is something that they can resolve, consistent with a widely shared view about the need to be transparent but also the need to protect secrets that are critical to our national security.\nPam.\nQ: The review has been going on, I believe, since 2014, so why does it take two years to review 28 pages?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, Pam, I haven't read the pages so I don't know what's in it, but you can try to check with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence who will oversee that process, is overseeing that process, and maybe will provide you some greater insight into what kinds of factors are affecting the ultimate decision.\nQ: Is the President bound by the outcome of that review? Could he decide on his own to say, I'm going to release it anyway despite what you're recommending?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know the answer to that. I know that people often discuss the fact that the President does have the ability to decide on his own what information can be declassified. But obviously there is a process in place to consider the various points of view of releasing sensitive national security information. In some cases, there was a conclusion reached that this information can be released without damaging national security. In other situations, there conclusion was reached that the information can't be released because, for example, it could reveal sources and methods through which information is obtained. So the need to protect those sources and methods is often a justification for not releasing information.\nBut again, I don't know whether or not that's relevant in the context of this specific decision, because I haven't reviewed the 28 pages.\nQ: If the information included evidence or indications that the Saudi government or other institutions in Saudi Arabia had some sort of support for the hijackers, would the President feel that he could release that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think that's a hypothetical that's hard to address from here. I just don't know whether or not that applies in this case.\nQ: On the issue of the Wall Street reform, the President said when he had Janet Yellen here in early March that Wall Street reform has worked. Today, there was another settlement as a result of the financial meltdown. Why has there been no major criminal actions for people who were involved in that? The savings and loan crisis, which was a smaller financial crisis, there were something like a thousand major criminal referrals out of that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that any sort of decisions about a prosecution for a financial crime would be made by an independent federal prosecutor. So those kids of decisions are made by prosecutors. The reason that those decisions are not made by people who are in political jobs is because we have an expectation in this country that the law is going to be applied fairly and evenly without regard to political considerations.\nSo in this case, those kinds of decisions are made by federal prosecutors, and I'd refer you to the Department of Justice for an answer or an update, to the extent they can provide one, about an ongoing investigation.\nWhat I will say is that people who have taken a close look at the financial crisis that this country endured in 2007 and 2008, many of them concluded that the problem was not predominantly that individuals were engaged in legal activity, but rather that the risky bets that they were making were entirely legal. And that was obviously a problem. Because when those risky bets went bad, it shook the global financial markets. It weakened confidence in the U.S. economy. And it reverberated around the world. That's a problem, obviously.\nAnd that is why the President, working closely with members of Congress, was committed to reforming Wall Street in a way that would not leave taxpayers on the hook for bailing out a bank or another financial institution that made bad bets. The reform legislation also included measures that prevented, or at least reduced, the riskiness of the bets that these financial institutions were allowed to make. For example, one of the chief reforms that were considered by the law and were implemented successfully is an increase in the capital buffer that many banks have to maintain. Essentially, they can't -- they need to keep in hand more financial reserves to leverage against bets that could go bad. And that had brought greater stability to our financial system.\nAnd the irony of this is, is that we saw many of the leading advocates of banks and traders and people on Wall Street said that those kinds of reforms would throw a wet blanket over the economy, that they would inhibit innovation and inhibit the kind of investment that's critical to the dynamism of our economy.\nBut I think the kind of strength, and sustained strength, that we've seen in our economy over the last several years indicates that they were wrong, that it is possible to implement the kind of Wall Street reform that would protect taxpayers, that would protect the global economy, without overly inhibiting the ability of the U.S. economy to continue to thrive. And the President has been very satisfied that not only is it possible to strike that right balance, but that these reforms succeeded in striking that right balance in terms of protecting the American people, protecting the U.S. economy, while allowing our economy overall to thrive and to become the envy of the world.\nQ: Those are forms of protecting things going forward. Do you think that the fact that there have been no, or very few, criminal prosecutions of any major players in the meltdown is a factor in the simmering anger that a lot of Americans have that nobody was really punished for what happened?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have them in front of me, but there are certainly some statistics that we can provide related to settlements that were obtained by the Department of Justice and other actions that were taken by the Department of Treasury that indicate that there was important accountability brought to bear. And that is important, and the President has spoken to how important that is.\nWhat's important, though, and what is also critical to building confidence in the financial system is demonstrating that laws can be put in place to prevent those kinds of things from happening again. And we've been very gratified over the last several years to see Wall Street reform be implemented over the strenuous objections of many on Wall Street. In a way, that has succeeded in making our financial system safer and more stable without inhibiting the growth of a thriving U.S. economy.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Do you have any update on when the TPP trade agreement is going to be submitted to Congress, or has the Supreme Court nomination thrown off your schedule?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any update for when this would be submitted to Congress. Obviously, the text of the agreement has been public for quite some time, and it continues to be available for public review and for review by individual members of Congress. But for an official submission to Congress, I just don't have a timeframe to lay out for you.\nAt this point, it's not clear to me that that would in any way be affected by the ongoing effort to get members of the United States Senate to do their jobs and actually give Chief Judge Garland the kind of fair public hearing and timely yes or no vote that he surely deserves.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. In trading notes with the chairwoman, will the President discuss the level of interest rates right now?\nMR. EARNEST: I would not anticipate that, even in a confidential setting, that the President would have a conversation with the Chair of the Fed that would undermine her ability make these kinds of critical monetary policy decisions independently. So the conversation hasn't occurred yet, so I don't want to prejudge too much. But I know that the President cares deeply about preserving both the appearance of and the fact of the independence of the Federal Reserve and the chair. And I'm sure the President will keep that priority in mind, even in the context of their private discussion.\nJulie.\nQ: I want to go back to something the President said over the weekend with regard to this issue of classified information. He seemed to make a distinction when he was talking about Hillary Clinton's emails between classified information and really classified information, as if there were some sort of gray area between whether something deserved to be kept secret for national security reasons or not. But this administration has been pretty absolute about going after leakers of classified information of whatever it might be, going as far as to prosecute them for divulging some of this stuff.\nSo I guess I'm wondering, which is it? Does the President actually believe that there is some classified information that is more deserving of protection for national security purposes than others? Or does he believe that in all cases you have to follow the law, and classified is classified?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's an interesting question. Let me try to answer it in a couple of different ways here. I think what is true is that there are always going to be, always have been and will be in the future -- there will be disputes in the national security bureaucracy -- again, I use that word not perjoratively -- about what information can safely be released and what information can't.\nSo why don't I just give one general example that I think has been discussed in this context -- and when I say discussed in this context, I mean reported by all of you publicly -- which is the question about whether or not information continues to be classified, even though it's been publicly reported. There are some in the national security establishment who would say, well, it doesn't matter if it's been reported by The Washington Post -- this information is still classified, because it could, if confirmed by the U.S. government, undermine our ability to protect sources and methods. I think other people -- probably many other people -- would conclude that there's not all significant interest that the U.S. government has in keeping something secret if everybody can read about it in The Washington Post -- just to cite one example.\nAnd this is part of a debate that goes on not just in the context of Secretary Clinton's emails, but in the context of making decisions about releasing information that's requested as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request. And considering the administration responded to more than 700,000 Freedom of Information Act requests just last year, I think that should be an indication to all of us that this is a conversation that happens quite frequently. So that's the first thing.\nI think the second thing is -- and this is something that the President did allude to in his answer -- there are secrets that are critical to our national security. There are secrets that I think that even journalists occasionally would acknowledge should be kept secret in order to protect the American people. Now, how to keep that secret and for how long to keep that information secret is surely the subject of legitimate debate. But at its core, there are some things that I think we all acknowledge should be kept secret, and that means when information like that is not kept secret by people who have taken an oath to protect it, that those individuals should be held accountable.\nNow, when it comes to prosecutions by the Department of Justice of people who are accused of leaking classified information, violating the pledge that they signed to protect that information, those are decisions that are made by independent prosecutors. And so I can't weigh in at this point about whether or not those prosecutions were justified or whether or not they were legitimate, or even handled appropriately. Many of the investigations that you refer to were actually begun by the previous administration. And I think that should be an indication to you of how serious this administration takes the responsibility of ensuring that those kinds of investigations are insulated from political influence.\nThe fact that they were commenced under a previous administration I think is an indication that they aren't subjected to second-guessing by people who have politics in their job description. That's a good thing for our country. That's a good thing for inspiring confidence in the ability of our investigators and prosecutors to make decisions on the merits, to make decisions in pursuit of justice and not in pursuit of a political agenda.\nAnd I think that's why you saw the President draw such a hard line with Chris Wallace in the interview in indicating that he could guarantee that there will not be any political influence in the ongoing investigation of Secretary Clinton's email system. And that's an important part of preserving the integrity of the justice system and protecting the generally accepted notion of what justice actually is -- that this is a decision that should be made by federal prosecutors with regard to the law, not with regard to politics. And the President believes in the principle quite strongly, and I think that's why he was so categorical in discussing it with Mr. Wallace.\nQ: Two things. You seem to be suggesting that the President and this administration is not supportive of some of these leak prosecutions that have happened since he's been President that --\nMR. EARNEST: I think the point that I'm making is, it doesn't matter whether or not we support them; they're going to move forward because the decisions that are made about those investigations are made independent of the preference of anyone with politics in their job description. And that's how it should be. So whether or not the President or some other elected official approves of, or disapproves of, those investigations is irrelevant. These are decisions that are made by the independent federal prosecutors, and that the way, in this country, that we ensure that our system of justice is conducted with regard to the law and to evidence and facts, not politics.\nQ: Back to key question of whether -- I mean, he seemed to be saying that there can be a debate over what's classified and what's not classified. You said that earlier. But if that's the case, then how can this administration expect compliance with the law? I mean, is something classified if it's marked classified? Is it classified if the President or somebody else decides that it is really vital to national security? I mean, it seems like there's a distinction there that's not being captured by the classification process that he's trying to get at, that it's not clear under the law.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President is just making the observation -- and I think you're drawing a pretty clear illustration here, too -- of how complicated this picture is. And obviously there is a need for individuals who sign an oath to protect classified information to protect that information. I signed that oath. That's something that I abide by. Even in the context of these kinds of discussions that we have, it's not uncommon for me to be asked about classified information and I certainly do my best to try to help all of you work on your stories, but I also do so with the knowledge that I need to protect that information. And I'm certainly not the only official in the government that has that kind of responsibility. And it certainly is a responsibility that I take seriously, and I think it's a responsibility that the vast majority of government officials take quite seriously.\nAnd I think as the President alluded, Secretary Clinton has acknowledged that with regard to this information, none of which was stamped classified, that she was a little careless, and that if she had an opportunity to do it differently and to handle this information differently, she would have done that. But what's also true is, she has said from the beginning that none of the information that she received or sent from that email account was stamped or marked classified. And I haven't read all the emails that have been released -- many of you have -- but I haven't seen any evidence publicly that what she said about that was wrong. And considering that we're talking about tens of thousands of emails, I think that's a relevant fact.\nSuzanne.\nQ: Josh, can I just follow up on that? So the President also said he doesn't believe that Hillary Clinton put national security at risk. So just to be clear, is this a belief, or is this knowledge based on knowing the emails or being briefed that these emails did not put national security at risk?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me be clear about this, Suzanne. The President has neither sought nor received a confidential briefing or confidential information about the ongoing investigation. The President's knowledge about this situation is based entirely on public reporting. This is one of the benefits of the approach that Secretary Clinton and her team have taken to dealing with this matter. Secretary Clinton said, let's just make all the email public. And all of you and your news organizations have spent God knows how many hours reviewing all those emails, some of them interesting, most of them mundane, but it does give the American public some insight into what is included in those emails. And when you hear the President's public comments on this matter, it's based entirely on the reporting that you and your news organizations have done on this matter.\nQ: So he's confident that there is nothing that is missing in any -- I mean, he's absolutely confident that he has all the information he needs to come up with that conclusion?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President was asked a specific question and he shared his view based on public reporting on this that has been done. At the same time, the President was careful, both at the beginning and at the end of the questioning, to acknowledge -- and this goes back to what Julie was asking -- to acknowledge that the opinion that really matters here is the opinion of the independent investigators who are taking a close look at this. And the President does have confidence that those prosecutors and other investigators will exercise their independent judgment, that they'll set politics aside and they'll focus on the facts of the case and they will allow the facts to guide them as they pursue their investigation.\nAnd that is certainly what the President would expect, and it's consistent with what both Attorney General Lynch and Director Comey have said about the investigation.\nQ: And just another point on what the President talked about with Fox. He said, regarding the worst mistake, probably failing to plan the day after the U.S.-led invasion of Libya. There are a lot of people who criticize President Bush and his administration for their lack of planning after intervening in Iraq and not having sufficient understanding, historical understanding of the sectarian violence there between Sunni and Shia. Does the administration, does the President, do they see parallels? Do they see any kind of inherent risk in the administration leading a coalition in the Middle East in a volatile situation such as that and in terms of his own thinking of lessons learned?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's difficult to compare the two situations because, obviously, the previous administration ordered military action as a result of intelligence that didn't prove to be true. The intervention in Libya was different. The intervention in Libya was based on an emergent situation where you had a bloodthirsty dictator vowing to slaughter thousands, if not tens of thousands of innocent people. And the President of the United States led an international coalition to try to prevent that from happening and, by and large, they did. So I think it's difficult to compare these two situations.\nQ: In the post-planning, not understanding or not having the commitment of allies come through, is there any kind of parallel that the administration sees in the risk, the inherent risk of working and depending on those allies and having it fall through? Because you talk about the power vacuum and that's the same thing we see here.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I do think that the point that the President was making is not that any specific ally of the United States had utterly failed to follow through on a specific commitment that they had made, but rather that the United States and our broader coalition had not succeeded in mobilizing the necessary resources to bring about the scenario that we would have eventually liked to see.\nNow, the good news in Libya is that we have made some important progress in recent years. It's just taken a whole lot longer than we planned for. And I think that's the point that the President has made. Obviously the United Nations has done some really important work in building up this government of national accord that is now in Tripoli and working to establish itself as the legitimate government of Libya, and to persuade the militias on -- the varying militias that exercise significant influence over that country to lay down their arms and to support the government of the country that can eventually try to bring the security situation inside of Libya under control.\nThis is going to be a long process, but the United States, certainly our coalition partners at that time, and the broader international community have been critical to the success of this effort or at least of the progress that they have been able to make thus far.\nSerena.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. So Lt. Commander Edward Lin charged with espionage and attempted espionage -- given the fact that he was a high-ranking naval officer assigned to the maritime reconnaissance unit and the type of information he would have access to, is the President being kept updated on this case? Is he expressing any sentiments regarding it? And how damaging is the information he had access to in the hands of the Chinese and Taiwanese is that for American national security?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the substance of the allegations against the naval officer that you've just described. The Department of the Navy may be able to provide you some guidance around that. As it relates to this investigation and potential prosecution, I am quite limited in what I can say because the Department of the Navy has indicated that this individual has been charged with violations, including espionage, under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and there is a risk that saying much of anything about it could be perceived as the Commander-in-Chief influencing the chain of command with this matter.\nSo there's very little that I can say. I can just confirm for you that these charges have been filed, that there is an officer that is in custody at the Naval Consolidated Brig in Chesapeake. But other than that, I'd just refer you to the Department of the Navy for additional steps that will be taken.\nQ: Can you confirm that the President is being updated about the case, or has he expressed any kind of interest in --\nMR. EARNEST: I actually do not know whether or not the President has been briefed on this particular matter. But we'll see if we can get you some information about that.\nQ: On North Carolina, the controversial law making it illegal for a transgender person to use the bathroom of their choice, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo banned nonessential travel to the state, the Boss cancelling his show there -- has the President -- would he consider not traveling to North Carolina as a result of this law, or its impact on federal employees traveling to the state?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any decision like that having been reached on the part of the President or any other federal government official. But obviously we've seen some of the other leaders in entertainment and in business come forward and express their significant discomfort with this law that the state of North Carolina has passed and the governor has signed into law.\nAgain, I talked about this a little bit before, but I think it relevant, particularly in this case, in light of even some of the more recent developments, that the state of North Carolina, over the last couple of decades, has really thrived economically by aggressively marketing a friendly business climate. They've talked about how they've really been able to harness the innovation in the Research Triangle to create an environment where small businesses with a good idea can succeed. And we've seen big businesses look to try to get in on the action and to try to capitalize on that kind of environment to ensure the success of their business or to even advance their business model.\nI think what is also true, though, is you're detracting from the business environment if you essentially are going to make it legal to discriminate against that business's employees or customers. And I think that is a question that the governor of North Carolina, in particular, failed to account for, but one that ultimately he'll have to answer for.\nDave.\nQ: Josh, when you said earlier that the President was taking the lesson of Libya and trying to apply it in other situations since then, we're you referring to Syria or ISIL? What were you talking about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this is the kind of lesson that can be applied in a variety of situations. I think there's some relevant lessons to draw in thinking about the situation in Syria. For example, the President has received sustained criticism, predominantly from Republicans but not just from Republicans, for not ordering a military strike against the Assad regime back in 2013 once the intelligence community had concluded that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons against innocent civilians. I don't know if the President had the situation in Libya in mind as he considered what should happen next, but there is a relevant analogy to be drawn in asking the question about what would happen next in Syria after that military strike was taken.\nAnd I think that's -- understanding the longer-term consequences of military action is important for the Commander-in-Chief to consider. And, frankly, it's the kind of thing that the Commander-in-Chief should consider before ordering military action. And it certainly guides the decision-making that President Obama has made in the context of responding to ISIL both in Iraq and in Syria.\nQ: Is it accurate, then, to say that Libya made him more reluctant to go into Syria? Or he wasn't predisposed to go into Syria in the first place, was he?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know about -- well, I guess I don't know entirely what you mean by predisposed to go into Syria.\nQ: I mean that he started from a position of not wanting to go into Syria and getting involved in their civil war, right?\nMR. EARNEST: That is certainly true that the President would have preferred to not be in a situation where he had to order a small number of U.S. special operators on the ground in Syria. That's true.\nBut, look, that's also true that he would have preferred to not be in a situation in which the United States was carrying out airstrikes or providing assistance to fighters on the ground inside of Syria. But because of the failure of the Assad regime to effectively govern that country, it created a vacuum. And we saw an extremist organization like ISIL attempt to set up a safe haven inside of Syria, and that led to some significant problems. And the President at every turn has been focused on making sure that the kinds of decisions that he's making to counter ISIL are consistent with our long-term national security interests.\nBut I guess the premise of your question that I would disagree with is the President hasn't done so reluctantly. The President has understood that, at least in this case, it was important for him to order military action in order to protect the American people, in order to protect our interests around the world. Of course, he would have welcomed a scenario in which that use of military force was not necessary. He would certainly have preferred an Assad regime that was much more effective in respecting and protecting basic human rights and effectively governing that country. That's not what we have seen.\nAnd the President has not hesitated to use military force where necessary to take ISIL fighters off the field, to try to have an influence over the battlefield against ISIL so that we can degrade and ultimately destroy that terrorist organization.\nQ: Quickly one other thing, does the White House have any comment on the $5 billion settlement payment by Goldman Sachs that was finalized today in the mortgage crisis?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think I have a specific reaction to it. I mean I think it's -- this obviously goes back to Pam's question from earlier. Obviously, decisions about prosecutions and settlements are made by prosecutors at the Department of Justice. And so I wouldn't second-guess the conclusions that they have reached. But I think obviously the President believes that people should be held accountable for their actions. And that's particularly if there's a situation in which your actions may have been a contributor to the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Interesting conversation between the President and my colleague Chris Wallace on Sunday. The President used the word \"careless\" to describe Secretary Clinton's use of her private email server. And I'm wondering if he feels like there is a difference, as a constitutional lawyer, scholar, as a President, between the words careless and negligent? Are they not the same under the law?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's hard for me to parse the President's answer on this. I do think the President was not careless in choosing which words to use in answering this question. But why he chose one word over another is not something I can speak to.\nQ: Do you see them as the same?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the point here is that in some ways it doesn't matter what I think. In the most important way it doesn't matter what I think because this is something that is being looked at by federal prosecutors, and they'll take a look at how the decisions were made about setting up the email system, and they'll ultimately make their own conclusions. And they'll make their own determination about what are the appropriate questions to ask.\nAnd again, that is the way that we instill confidence in the public in our criminal justice system -- if the questions that are being asked by independent federal prosecutors are questions that they themselves decide to ask. They'll decide who should answer them, and they will reach a conclusion about what consequences that means for the law and whether or not a prosecution should move forward. That's a process that has served the American people quite well.\nThis is not the tradition in many countries. In other countries, there are situations where political officials are essentially in charge of the justice system or wield inordinate influence over the justice system such that people with different political views are treated differently in the criminal justice system. And we value the political independence of our justice system in this country because it gives us all confidence that people are going to be considered fairly under the law without regard to their political views.\nAnd this is a principle that is worth protecting. And sometimes it does mean that I, for example, will not be able to answer your questions in as detailed a fashion as I would like because it's not just that this is a principle that we want to protect. I think all of you, for example, take the Attorney General at her word when she testifies before Congress that she's \"aware of no efforts to undermine our review or investigation into this matter at all;\" or when Director Comey says that he's taken a close look at the case and being regularly updated on it because he wants to make sure that \"there's no outside influence.\" So they've been able to -- the individuals who are responsible for conducting this investigation have been able to publicly conclude that they don't feel like they're subject to influence.\nYou've heard the President of the United States say definitively in the context of his interview that he would guarantee that there is no political influence that was going to be brought to bear in this kind of situation. And I think the combination of those three comments I think can give people a lot of confidence that everybody who goes through the criminal justice system -- whether they're as well-known as Secretary Clinton or not -- is going to be treated fairly, and that the public interest will be served by the fair treatment of those individuals.\nQ: Just a couple more very quickly. If the President emailed the Secretary on her private server, or her clintonemail.com address, would he not then have an obligation to at least somehow report that? Because you're talking about government business going to a private email -- presumably unsecure email server. Would he not have to at least report that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the point here is that while the President was certainly aware of her email address, he was not aware of the system that had been put in place to support it.\nThere are many reasons why an individual might have -- particularly somebody who is in a position like the Secretary of State who might have an email address that cannot be easily guessed by the general public or by our nation's adversaries. For example, there is a reason that she was not at hclinton@state.gov And so I think that is the reason that no one who emailed with the Secretary of State -- at least that I'm aware of -- from the White House knew of her private email server arrangement. They certainly were aware that she had a different email address than other State Department employees. But I'm not aware of anybody at the White House who knew of the arrangement that she had in place.\nQ: Is it also, then, fair to say that no one at the White House makes it a regular occurrence -- or the President, at least, doesn't make it a regular occurrence to email private email addresses conducting government business?\nMR. EARNEST: That's true. The instructions that the White House has provided to all federal employees is that they should use their government email for government business. And if there are isolated situations in which individuals had to use their personal email, that information is transferred over the official system so it can be properly archived and used to respond to specific inquiries.\nThere are a variety of situations where this could come up. If your Blackberry stops working, which has happened on more than one occasion, or if you're traveling overseas and you're having some trouble with connectivity, you may have access to your personal email. But what's important is that this is a situation that's not the norm, and then in those rare instances when it is used, that those personal emails are properly maintained on the official system by either cc'ing your official address or just forwarding the exchange over to your official account.\nQ: Just so I'm clear, so no government business should be transacted between, say, the President's account and some private account?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, certainly when the President is doing business -- and he does not do very much business over email. As you would expect, much of the business that the President is engaged in would be reasonably described as either classified or at least sensitive information. So when the President is doing that kind of business, yes, it is generally over government email.\nQ: Last one. Eight of the 11 remaining Obamacare health insurance co-ops according to reporting are likely to fail this year. And I'm just curious of knowing now what we know about the dollars spent, about the commitment made, was this the right strategy for the American people?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the focal point of the Affordable Care Act was making sure that we are expanding access to as many people across the country as possible. And when I say access I mean access to quality, affordable health insurance. And we've seen that some 13 million people now have taken advantage of the Affordable Care Act to get coverage. And this is good, quality, affordable coverage in the vast majority of cases that they didn't previously have access to.\nAnd our goal here was to use competition, and we have seen positive progress in building competition in individual marketplaces. So in individual states in 2014, the average number of issuers per state was eight. In -- I'm going to make sure I get the years right. In 2013, it was eight; 2014 it was nine. And this most recent year it was 10. So we've seen a steady increase in the average number of issuers per state in these individual marketplaces.\nThe premise here is that by increasing competition, we can create an environment in which individual insurers are competing for people's business. That means that individual insurers are going to be competing to drive down costs and to drive up benefits. And that's how we've arrived at a scenario where more people have access to quality, affordable health insurance than ever before.\nThe consequence of that is that when you do see situations where particular health care arrangements don't pan out, the good news for the customers of those arrangements is that they've got lots of other options. They've got lots of other viable options where they can go and get quality, affordable health insurance on the private market, something that was not previously available to them.\nQ: So you're okay with $2.5 billion spent, invested in 2010, and eight of the 11 remaining failing -- that's okay because the ends justify the means?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what we would like to see, in general, is increased competition. That's exactly what we've got. We also were looking to save money. And over the next 10 years, we will find -- and this is something that even the CBO has concluded -- tens of billions of dollars in deficit reduction as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\nSo there is no denying that millions of Americans got access to quality, affordable health insurance for the first time because of the Affordable Care Act, and the American taxpayers are going to see health care costs that are paid by the federal government limited in such a way that we're actually going to reduce the deficit by tens of billions of dollars. And that's a significant achievement, one that our naysayers long thought was not possible. And that's probably why many of those naysayers won't even acknowledge the important progress that we've been able to make.\nKristin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you talk a little bit about three, four months into the year, the state of the President's relationship with Speaker Paul Ryan? Do they talk? Do they talk often? When is the last time that they spoke? Does the President think that he's doing a good job?\nMR. EARNEST: The President certainly does continue to respect Speaker Ryan. I think no one underestimates the significance of the challenge that he's undertaken. Certainly the President hasn't. They do speak with some frequency. Oftentimes those are conversations that we don't disclose. So I can't tell you the last time that they spoke, but it certainly is not unusual for the two men to trade phone calls. That's typically how they'll communicate.\nI don't want to leave you with the impression this happens every day or every week, even. But it's not unusual for them to engage in a conversation. And the President certainly respects the important responsibilities that Speaker Ryan has as the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives. And Speaker Ryan is somebody who has demonstrated that he is -- takes quite seriously the responsibilities that he has. He is somebody who has been quite thoughtful about his views and his prescription for how to further strengthen the country.\nObviously, the two men have some pretty significant differences of opinion. And what we've tried to focus on are areas where there is common ground. Passing funding to make sure that our health care professionals have the necessary resources to fight Zika is something where Democrats and Republicans should be able to find common ground. Hopefully, Speaker Ryan will take action on that.\nSpeaker Ryan has talked before about how expanding the earned income tax credit could be a powerful way to fight poverty. The President has considered this a reasonable and maybe even promising policy approach. Hopefully, Democrats and Republicans in the Congress could work together to arrive at an expansion of the earned income tax credit in a way that would be good for our economy.\nDemocrats and Republicans along the campaign trail have certainly spent a long time talking about how to fight heroin abuse and opioid addiction. President Obama believes this is a priority. You'll recall he traveled down to Atlanta a couple of weeks ago to talk about this. Hopefully, this is something -- the President was actually introduced by the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, a Republican from Kentucky named Hal Rogers. Hopefully, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Ryan can work together to advance this important priority. The President would certainly welcome that.\nMr. Ryan -- Speaker Ryan made clear that the House would begin to take action to help Puerto Rico address the significant financial challenges that are plaguing Puerto Rico. The administration has obviously played an important role, and we've seen Democrats and Republicans come together to begin to make some progress. There's a lot of work that remains to be done, but they're obviously off to a good start, and we're pleased about that.\nSo there's no shortage of opportunities for Speaker Ryan and President Obama to work together in a way that doesn't require either of them to capitulate on core principles. But there is an opportunity and a requirement that both of them put the interests of the country ahead of more narrow political considerations. And I think it remains to be seen how serious House Republicans are about setting aside the grousing that they may find in some corners of their party for cooperating with President Obama so that they can actually find some common ground on something that Democrats and Republicans agree would be good for the country.\nQ: On politics, does President Obama have a position on the possibility that the Republicans could have a brokered convention?\nMR. EARNEST: He does not. (Laughter.)\nQ: So, hypothetically, if Paul Ryan were to be part of that brokered convention, he would have no feeling on that either?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my rudimentary understanding of the Republican nomination process is that as the Speaker of the House -- Speaker Ryan actually is the chair of the convention. So if an open convention or a brokered convention does come about, it does seem that Speaker Ryan would, whether he likes it or not, play a prominent role in that prospect.\nQ: And finally, does the White House believe its strategy to confirm Merrick Garland is working?\nMR. EARNEST: We certainly have made a lot of important progress in confirming -- or getting the Senate, frankly, to do its job and to give Chief Judge Garland a fair hearing and a timely yes or no vote.\nThis is a good opportunity for me to talk about what I think will be a pretty important week in this nomination process. I'm not aware of any meetings that Chief Judge Garland has today on Capitol Hill, but over the course of this week, he'll be meeting with 14 difference senators, six of them Republicans. And he'll be starting tomorrow by having breakfast with the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley.\nNow, you'll recall that just hours after the announcement of Justice Scalia's untimely death, that Republican Leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell announced that the Senate would not be considering a presidential nomination to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. So the fact that Judge Garland is meeting this week with six different Republican senators to discuss his nomination I think is an indication that we've made important progress. And let me explain to you why.\nAfter meeting with these Republican senators, I think -- I guess by the end of the week, he'll be up to nine, because he's already met with three different Republican senators -- Senators Collins, Kirk and Boozman. But after having those meetings, I think an obvious question will be begged of those Republican senators, and it's simply this: If you've had an opportunity to hear from Chief Judge Garland directly, why shouldn't your constituents?\nAfter all, you're the one making the case that the people's voice should be heard in this process, so why shouldn't the people have the opportunity to hear from Chief Judge Garland about his views, about his record? He obviously has spent 19 years on the federal bench, serving in the -- what's often described as the second-highest court in the land, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. He has more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history. So he certainly has the capacity to answer these questions. He's prepared to do it on camera, under oath. He's prepared to take whatever questions Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee may have to put forward. He can handle it. I guess the question is, why can't the people asking the questions handle it?\nI suspect -- I have a theory, to the extent that I'm able to divine much insight into the mind of any Republican senator -- I think this is what Republicans are concerned about. They're concerned about giving him that opportunity because, if they do, it will be clear to the American public that he's deserving of a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. And it's going to make it a lot harder for them to justify blocking it. So that's why you've seen Leader McConnell try to shut this down at the pass.\nBut the fact that, at the end of the week, Chief Judge Garland will have met with nine Republican senators is an indication that we're making some important progress. There's a long way to go, but it certainly is going to -- as Chief Judge Garland does these meetings, it's not going to reduce the number of questions that Republican senators are facing about why they're blocking his nomination and refusing to do their job. It's only going to increase the frequency of those questions.\nAnd that's significant because we know, for example, that this is an accusation that Chairman Grassley himself is pretty uncomfortable with. He himself has said that he resents the notion that he's not doing his job. But the fact is, as the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has as much influence as anyone over whether or not Chief Judge Garland is going to get a fair hearing. He'll have as much say as anyone about the way the Senate Judiciary Committee reports out his nomination. And that will have a significant impact on how individual members of the United States Senate vote on his nomination.\nSo, look, these tough questions of the senators are just getting started. And it's ironic that in the back halls of Congress, you see a lot of Republican senators sort of ducking questions from members of the media about why they're blocking Chief Judge Garland's nomination while at the same time you see Chief Judge Garland eager to go out in public, under oath, on camera and answer all the questions that these senators can think of to ask.\nThat is why the position that Republicans have adopted is so difficult to defend, both as a matter that's central to their constitutional responsibilities, but it's also why, frankly, as a matter of politics, it's a tough question for them to answer.\nAngela.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back to the topic of the meeting with the Fed Chairwoman. The L.A. Times reported last year that there's a Federal Reserve regulatory job, the Vice Chair for Supervision, that was created back in Dodd-Frank, but that has never been filled. And now, Chairman Shelby is holding up other Fed nominations, saying that this is -- the fact that this job hasn't been filled is the reason for those holes. Does the President have any intention to ever nominate somebody to be the Fed's Vice Chair for Supervision?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think it is -- I don't have any personnel announcements to make at this point in terms of individuals who may be considered or when a nomination could be put forward. But I think it is a tough case to make for Senator Shelby to say that he's not going to fill any vacancies on the Fed until one specific vacancy has been filled. I don't think it sort of matches people's common sense about how the Senate should fulfill its duties, particularly when you consider that there are two individuals, highly qualified Federal Reserve nominees, that have been put forward -- almost a year ago in one case, and more than a year ago in the other case -- to fill important positions on the board.\nAnd we're going to continue to make a forceful case for these two individuals. And Chairman Grassley doesn't exactly have a strong record to stand on -- I'm sorry, Senator Shelby doesn't have a strong record to stand on when considering nominees to the Senate Banking Committee. It obviously is his failure to act expeditiously in this area. It's something that has already garnered strong criticism of his conduct. And his continued obstruction of two highly qualified Federal Reserve nominees is only going to enhance that criticism.\nQ: One other business matter. Does the White House have any comment on Canadian Pacific's decision to abandon its merger attempt with Norfolk Southern Railroad?\nMR. EARNEST: I actually am not aware of those reports. I don't know if that's something that just broke, but if there's a specific reaction we have, we can get it to you.\nScott, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Has the President had any conversations with Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz about her payday lending bill?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. And I don't know the details of the legislation that she has put forward. Obviously, the President has put out a statement announcing his enthusiastic support for her reelection. But I'm not aware of any position the administration has taken on her legislative proposal.\nQ: Her legislative proposal would sort of undermine the CFPB's rule that the President was touting a year ago.\nMR. EARNEST: Why don't we -- when I do a little work on learning more about her legislation, we'll get back to you on it, okay?\nAll right. Thanks, everybody.\nEND 2:47 P.M.

It means millions of Americans have difficulty even getting their foot in the door to try to get a job much less actually hang on to that job. That's bad for not only those individuals, it's bad for our economy. It's bad for the communities that desperately need more role models who are gainfully employed. So we've got to make sure Americans who've paid their debt to society can earn their second chance.\n- President Barack Obama, Rutgers University, November 2, 2015\nToday at the White House, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett, and other White House officials hosted 19 companies from across the American economy who are standing with the Obama Administration as founding pledge takers to launch the Fair Chance Business Pledge. The pledge represents a call-to-action for all members of the private sector to improve their communities by eliminating barriers for those with a criminal record and creating a pathway for a second chance.\nCompanies signing the pledge today include: American Airlines, Busboys and Poets, The Coca-Cola Company, Facebook, Georgia Pacific, Google, Greyston Bakery, The Hershey Company, The Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System, Koch Industries, Libra Group, PepsiCo, Prudential, Starbucks, Uber, Under Amour/Plank Industries, Unilever and Xerox.\nRight now, there are approximately 2.2 million Americans behind bars. The United States accounts for 5 percent of the world's population, and 25 percent of its inmates. Each year, more than 600,000 inmates are released from federal and state prisons, and another 11.4 million individuals cycle through local jails. Around 70 million Americans have some sort of criminal record — almost one in three Americans of working age.\nToo often, that record disqualifies individuals from being a full participant in their communities — even if they've already paid their debt to society. As a result, millions of Americans have difficulty finding employment.\nSince President Obama took office, this Administration has been committed to reforming America's criminal justice system. Last summer, the President spoke about the importance of reducing barriers facing people who have been in contact with the criminal justice system and are trying to put their lives back on track. He then became the first President to visit a federal prison where he sat down with individuals who would be returning to their communities. In November, he visited with formerly incarcerated individuals and emphasized that a smarter approach to reducing crime and enhancing public safety must begin with investing in all of our communities. He also announced new efforts by this Administration to help formerly incarcerated individuals to rehabilitate and reintegrate back into their communities, including an upcoming rule from the Office of Personnel Management that will \"ban the box,\" delaying inquiries into criminal history until later in the federal hiring process.\nBuilding on these efforts, the White House issued a challenge to businesses to take on the Fair Chance Business Pledge. A broad array of businesses have come together to support the reforms needed to bring about this change.\nBy signing the Fair Chance Business Pledge, these companies are:\n• Voicing strong support for economic opportunity for all, including the approximately 70 million Americans who have some form of a criminal record.\n• Demonstrating an ongoing commitment to take action to reduce barriers to a fair shot at a second chance, including practices like \"banning the box\" by delaying criminal history questions until later in the hiring process; ensuring that information regarding an applicant's criminal record is considered in proper context; and engaging in hiring practices that do not unnecessarily place jobs out of reach for those with criminal records.\n• Setting an example for their peers. Today's announcement is only the beginning. Later this year, the Obama Administration will release a second round of pledges, with a goal of mobilizing more companies and organizations to join the Fair Chance Business Pledge.\nCompanies and organizations interested in joining the Fair Chance Business Pledge can so do by signing up HERE.\nBuilding on today's announcement, in the coming weeks, the White House and the Department of Justice will host events in Washington, D.C. and across the country to amplify leaders taking steps to provide fair chance opportunities:\n• The Justice Department has designated the week of April 24-30, 2016, as National Reentry Week and is coordinating reentry events across the country - from job fairs, to practice interviews, to mentorship programs, to events for children of incarcerated parents - designed to help prepare inmates for release. To learn more, click HERE.\n• In the coming weeks, the White House will host a Champions of Change event to honor individuals expanding fair chance opportunities. The event will highlight local leaders and programs that are improving their communities by partnering with the philanthropic and private sectors to help those who have been incarcerated rehabilitate and reintegrate.

When around 70 million Americans - nearly one in three adults - have a criminal record, it is important to remove unnecessary barriers that may prevent these individuals from gaining access to employment, training, education and other basic tools required for success in life. We are committed to providing individuals with criminal records, including formerly incarcerated individuals, a fair chance to participate in the American economy.\nThese companies put forth their pledges as follows:\nAMERICAN AIRLINES: At American Airlines, our employees are the source of our success, with a clear connection between the quality of our team and the quality of the experience we can provide our customers. American is working hard to recruit, develop, retain and engage the very best people - those with unique perspectives and ways of thinking that will position us as a global leader - while recognizing the importance, in appropriate circumstances, of giving people a second chance.\nTo ensure we aren't removing qualified individuals from employment consideration, we have banned the box and we don't ask criminal history questions until someone accepts an offer. We are also conducting consistent, reliable, and fair-minded background checks as part of our hiring process.\nWe commend the Administration and applaud the many corporations and organizations that are taking similar actions to give all Americans a fair chance to succeed and enjoy everything our country has to offer. American Airlines is proud to take the Fair Chance Business Pledge.\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY: Fair chance policies and programs not only enhance the likelihood of success for the more than 600,000 individuals who are released annually from state and federal prisons - they also help to reknit families and rebuild communities. For these and other reasons as outlined below, The Coca-Cola Company is pleased to join the Fair Chance Business Pledge as a signatory.\nThe Coca-Cola Company has a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity. This spans our employment practices and development of existing employees. We are dedicated to maintaining workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, pregnancy, veteran status, genetic information, citizenship status, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, or any other reason prohibited by law. The basis for recruitment, hiring, placement, training, compensation and advancement at the Company is qualifications, performance, skills and experience.\nWe are particularly proud to share that The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Refreshments do not engage in background screening related to criminal history until after a decision to hire has been made. When there is a successful applicant who has a criminal history, our talent acquisition team has in place a process to review the relevancy of the history to make an informed decision. We recognize that creating a pathway for a second chance is an important first step in creating successful, sustained re-entry into mainstream society.\nFACEBOOK: Facebook is a vocal supporter of equality and we are proud to stand with a growing number of companies who have chosen to ban the box. We strongly oppose hiring practices that discriminate against qualified applicants on the basis of criminal record.\nRecently, Facebook collaborated with the California Department of Justice on the agency's OpenJustice initiative, a program that promotes transparency in the criminal justice system to strengthen the public trust, enhance government accountability, and inform public policy development.\nSigning the Fair Chance Hiring pledge allows us to reaffirm our commitment to find ways that our company can create opportunities for all to succeed. And we encourage other organizations and employers to do the same.\nGOOGLE: Google has banned the box in its hiring process since 2011. In the last year alone, Google has advanced racial justice and criminal justice reform with grants to organizations and leaders totaling over $5 million. Google will continue its commitment to criminal justice reform and creating opportunities for formerly incarcerated Americans by:\n• Convening other leading technology companies to recruit more companies to ban the box and go beyond the box to support formerly incarcerated Americans re-entering the job market.\n• Conducting listening sessions with criminal justice organizations and formerly incarcerated leaders to understand what specific supports are needed and consider how Google products can be used to raise awareness of the issue of mass incarceration in America.\n• Hosting a series of regional forums on criminal justice reform with formerly incarcerated women and men.\nGREYSTON BAKERY: As part of our Fair Chance Pledge, we commit to:\n• Banning the Box - by delaying criminal history questions until later in the hiring process, or not asking them at all and giving individuals a chance to prove themselves through hard work regardless of background;\n• Training human resources staff on making fair decisions regarding applicants with criminal records, and other employment barriers, and reporting data on the number of applicants through Open Hiring;\n• Ensuring jobs, internships, apprenticeships, and regular and progressive job trainings are available to individuals with criminal records and other employment barriers;\n• Keeping an open door policy for Open Hiring for anyone to sign up for a chance at a job, when one becomes available; in the meantime, accessing workforce development trainings for employment readiness;\n• Providing mentorship and \"soft-skills\" support once on the job to ensure retention and readiness, particularly through the apprenticeship/internship period;\n• Supporting with placement to area employers from workforce development training programs whenever possible, through matching services and providing trainings in demand;\n• Providing key worker benefits past the apprenticeship period including: subsidized childcare, access to lower-cost nutritious food, and access to affordable housing, to address the highest risk factors of low-income workers and previously incarcerated individuals in sustaining employment;\n• Working to provide a \"living wage\" to all our workers in addition to subsidized worker benefits, to help those with employment barriers sustainably break the cycle of poverty.\nGreyston also takes action in our local community of Yonkers, NY by supporting other employers in considering Open Hiring in their businesses, de-risking fair chance employment for them by investing in workforce development and job training programs, to increase overall regional employability and job readiness, including in \"soft skills\" such as literacy and numeracy, mentorship, etc.\nGreyston also provides other community programs such as an early childcare center, community gardens, and housing supports for both worker benefit as well as community health and well-being, to truly contribute to sustained Fair Chance employment.\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL AND HEALTH SYSTEM: The Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System's (JHHS) practice of providing access and opportunity to the returning citizens of Baltimore is not a charitable endeavor, but a strategic part of the way we conduct our business. We are not just an organization that conducts business in Baltimore, but an integral part of the community — interwoven and connected for 126 years and counting.\nWhen Mr. Hopkins endowed the Hospital, he recognized that the service we provide can only have a positive lasting impact if all members of the community are a part of JHHS mission. We have made sure to keep Mr. Hopkins' directives, which in many ways mirror the Fair Chance Business Pledge, at the forefront of all that we do. This is evidenced in our hiring practice, which embraces our community's citizens who meet our hiring requirements — including returning citizens.\nWe have banned the box in our hiring process and have an established practice of individually reviewing applicants that have criminal background. This thoughtful, detailed process has enabled us to have a strong returning citizen hire rate over the years.\nOur long standing partnerships with community based partners, particularly those that serve returning citizens, and understand our organization and the work we do, provides us with a pipeline of talented applicants. We share our practices with other Baltimore City companies and encourage dialogue on the importance of engaging all of our citizens in the employment process.\nLastly, our organizations unwavering commitment to Baltimore City and Maryland is reflected in our Institution's leadership, managerial and supervisory staff, who understand that we have a lot of talented people in our community. We recognize that we cannot afford to let good talent get away — especially talent that might need a second chance.\nKOCH INDUSTRIES AND GEORGIA PACIFIC: Koch Industries and Georgia-Pacific support the Fair Chance Business Pledge and applaud the leadership of the White House on this critically important issue. The Pledge is consistent with Koch and Georgia-Pacific's mission to help people improve their lives and remove barriers to opportunity for all Americans, especially the least advantaged.\nWe believe that we shouldn't be rejecting people at the very start of the hiring process who may otherwise be capable and qualified, and want an opportunity to work hard.\nLIBRA GROUP: The Libra Group believes strongly in the twin values of hope and opportunity. Investing in the community isn't just a matter of 'paying back' with the fruits of commerce; it is good business in its own right. A community with hope and opportunity is one better equipped to contribute in tomorrow's world. Part of our responsibility in running an international business is to actively give something back. We do this through a series of 10 managed programs and initiatives which are broadly linked to the themes of community support and assisting people who have been denied or have limited opportunity, including the formerly incarcerated. Some of these initiatives include:\n• Drive Change: Libra Group supports Drive Change and its mission to use the food truck workplace to run a 1-year Fellowship for young people returning home from prison so they can obtain preferred employment and educational opportunities. Our monetary and in-kind support, in the form of essential skills trainings have allowed Drive Change to:\no Hire a part-time \"Truck Coach\" who will empower the young people in the program to gain the most from their entire Drive Change experience;\no Host hospitality trainings to make sure the Fellows are receiving quality instruction that can drive their future career opportunities;\no Support instructors in developing courses in work-place readiness, social media, marketing, money management and small business development;\no Provide management training for Executive Staff.\n• Defy Ventures: Libra Group provides funding to Defy Ventures to support its mission of harnessing the natural talents of formerly incarcerated individuals and redirecting them towards the creation of profitable and legal business ventures.\n• Libra Internship Program: Libra Group Internships are a unique opportunity for bright, talented young people with proven leadership potential to undertake a paid placement of up to six months' duration with the Libra Group and its subsidiaries around the world. We work with organizations such as LEDA (Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America), SEO, Prep for Prep, Harlem Children's Zone, Miami Dade College, Olivier Scholars and CUNY, who are dedicated to provide educational opportunities to students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nThrough Libra's Internship Program, we support the children of formerly incarcerated parents. We have hosted a number of students who have grown up with either one or both parents in the criminal justice system.\nPEPSICO: We all have a vested interest in creating conditions that allow individuals with criminal convictions to succeed. Finding a job is often one of the biggest barriers to a second chance; that's why PepsiCo is proud to sign the Fair Chance Business Pledge. A fair chance at a good job significantly increases an individual's chances of successfully re-entering society while strengthening the communities we all share.\nWe already \"ban the box\" by eliminating criminal history questions on our employment applications and delaying a background check until after a conditional offer of employment has been made. In cases of a criminal background, we individually review each case to understand the relevancy of the conviction, time passed, evidence of rehabilitation and other factors. All candidates have the opportunity to tell their unique story and will not be eliminated from consideration based solely on the fact of a criminal conviction.\nPepsiCo has a long history of promoting equal opportunity. We evaluate current and prospective employees solely on their qualifications, experience and performance - and we have zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind.\nWe will continue our efforts to create opportunities for formerly incarcerated Americans by working with community partners to provide job readiness training and support, such as Stanford Law School's Justice Advocacy Project, an effort to assist individuals with navigating the challenges of reentry.\nPRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL: Prudential Financial is proud to take the White House Fair Chance Business Pledge, building upon our long-standing commitment to equal opportunity. Our efforts to date have focused on establishing internal policies and supporting programs that rebuild communities and provide second chances to individuals and families.\nInternally, Prudential is committed to inclusive hiring practices when it comes to recruiting and retaining the best talent. We post our open roles publicly and do not inquire about an individual's criminal history until after an offer of employment is extended. If it is revealed that a candidate does have a criminal record, that does not in and of itself necessarily disqualify him/her.\nAdditionally, Prudential has provided nearly $50 million to support fair chance hiring policies by investing in businesses and organizations who have demonstrated a commitment to inclusive hiring practices. These practices include assisting individuals with criminal backgrounds through workforce training, which includes occupational skills training and workplace soft skills training, so that they can successfully re-enter the workforce.\nSTARBUCKS: Starbucks continues to encourage its partners (employees) and others to recognize the choices we, as organizations and as citizens, can each can make every day to see a different story for America. The Company believes that equal access to opportunities, for those willing to work hard and play fair, continues to be the promise of our country. In many ways, Starbucks is demonstrating responsible, compassionate ways to provide more individuals a second chance:\n• Ban the Box: Starbucks does not inquire about criminal histories on initial job applications and runs background checks only after a conditional offer of employment. The intent is to provide applicants with a criminal history the chance to be evaluated as a whole person by having their circumstances considered on a case-by-case basis.\n• Access to Opportunity: In partnership with like-minded organizations, Starbucks has come up with creative solutions to open doors for transitioning veterans, aspiring students seeking debt-free college degrees, and Opportunity Youth- 16-24 year olds who face systemic barriers to jobs and education.\n• 100,000 Opportunities Initiative: Supported by many of the country's youth and opportunity-focused nonprofit organizations, local governments, and participating funders, the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative is an employer led coalition of over 30 companies committed to engaging at least 100,000 opportunity youth by 2018 through experiential job fairs, apprenticeships, internships, and both part-time and full-time jobs. Since August, Starbucks has already hired over 7,000 opportunity youth, and plans to host its next hiring fair in its hometown of Seattle in May.\nUBER: Providing economic opportunities to those with certain offenses on their records is a way for Uber to help reentering citizens find a way to earn a living. Driving for the Uber platform is a great option for someone looking to get back on their feet: it's easy to get started and completely flexible.\nWe believe that the right path forward is to tailor our driver screening process to focus on issues that are directly relevant to providing a safe and reliable ride. We also conduct a transparent, up-to-date, and fair assessment of who should be on the Uber platform and who shouldn't. This ensures rider safety without excluding people who deserve a fair shot at work opportunities.\nTo that end, in California—where more than 100,000 people drive with Uber—we've committed to:\n• Notifying people who don't pass Uber's pre-screening process that they could be eligible for getting felonies on their records adjusted under Proposition 47 (which they only have until November 2017 to do) and pointing them to resources to help them do that.\n• Aligning our pre-screening process with Proposition 47 to give people with low-level, nonviolent convictions on their records the same economic opportunities as everyone else.\n• Referring people who still don't qualify to Defy Ventures to get work and entrepreneurship training as well as mentoring and job placement assistance.\nWe look forward to making similar commitments across the country, and we're pleased that already, our technology and our background check processes—which include screening through national, state, and local databases—are reliable and accurate without unnecessarily discriminating against minorities as fingerprint-based checks do. We're excited to continue working with community groups and reentry organizations across the country to explore ways our policies and technology can make our screening process fair for everyone.\nUNDER ARMOUR AND PLANK INDUSTRIES: Under Amour and Plank Industries want to commend the Administration for their leadership in promoting the Fair Business Pledge with employers across this country and we are proud to take the pledge across all of our businesses. This initiative serves as an important reminder that while we all seek to improve our economy and create jobs, we must also consider the barriers that prevent qualified individuals from joining the workforce.\nUnder Armour comes from very humble beginnings in Baltimore, Maryland. Today, we are a global brand in performance footwear, apparel and technology with nearly $4 billion in annual revenue employing 12,000 teammates in 28 offices across 18 countries. Baltimore is home to Under Armour, and as we grow, so will the opportunities in this great city.\nWhile Under Armour continues to be a catalyst for economic activity in Baltimore, we believe there is even more we can do to grow the economy. Taking the Fair Business Pledge is just one example of how we can make our hiring practices more inclusive for some in our community. Through the Blocal initiative, we have also pledged to work with other business leaders in Baltimore to promote locally owned businesses, hire more from the local community, buy from local suppliers and continue to give back to our local communities.\nAs leaders in business, we all focus on creating economic opportunity. As leaders in our community, we should also consider how everyone can participate in the opportunities we create.\nUNILEVER: Through the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, Unilever is committed to enhancing livelihoods and creating a brighter future for all. We believe that businesses like ours can and should play an important role in generating wealth and jobs around the world, improving skills and offering access to markets. Fairness in the workplace is about respecting the rights of all those who work with us. Furthermore, business can only truly flourish in societies and economies where human rights are respected and upheld.\nSeveral years ago, Unilever was one of the first companies to implement the \"banning the box\" policy, meaning that we no longer ask applicants to declare a criminal record prior to being invited to interview for a position. More recently, we decided that we will not conduct criminal background checks until a contingent offer has been made to a potential applicant. By taking these actions, Unilever is proud to be a signatory of the Fair Chance Business Pledge. We are committed to providing equal opportunities to individuals with criminal records a fair chance to participate in the American economy.\nXEROX: Xerox is proud to join other corporate leaders in \"banning the box.\" Xerox is committed to fostering an environment where everyone can contribute and succeed at every level of the corporation.\nOur outreach into diverse and broad employment markets for qualified individuals results in hiring our talented workforce and allows us to build and maintain an inclusive corporate culture. We strive continually to strengthen our work environment on an ongoing basis by valuing employees with different backgrounds and perspectives.", "timestamp": "2016-04-11", "title": "Fact Sheet: White House Launches the Fair Chance Business Pledge"}

As President, I'll aggressively pursue trade cases and impose consequences when China breaks the rules by dumping its cheap products in our markets. And I'll oppose efforts to grant China so-called \"market economy\" status, which would weaken our tools for dealing with this behavior. I've gone toe-to-toe with China's top leaders on some of the toughest issues we face.

As Senator, she fought for workers and manufacturers in New York, standing up to China when they tried to put tariffs on New York's exports. In communities across the state, from Buffalo to Rochester to Albany, Clinton brought together workers, businesses large and small, and every level of government to work to invest in good-paying jobs and production in the state. As Secretary of State, she confronted Chinese leaders on a wide swath of issues, from cyber attacks to human rights to climate change.\nClinton understands that America spent generations working with partners to develop strong and fair rules of the road for the global economy – but those rules only work if the U.S. enforces them. Tough enforcement and other smart policies to support a manufacturing renaissance are the only way we can ensure that trade helps American workers. That's why, throughout this campaign, Clinton has made clear that, as President, she will:\n* Crack down on foreign countries, like China, when they cheat the rules: If foreign countries dump products on our markets, like China is doing right now with steel, Clinton's administration will take countervailing action. She will appoint a new trade prosecutor that reports directly to the President and triple the number of trade enforcement officers to keep other countries honest. She will take on foreign countries that keep their goods artificially cheap by manipulating their currencies, and expand our toolbox to include effective new remedies to respond, such as duties, tariffs, or other measures. And she opposes China's efforts to be recognized as a \"market economy,\" which would defang our anti-dumping laws.\n* Say \"no\" to new trade agreements that don't meet her high bar – including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Clinton will hit pause and say \"no\" to new trade agreements unless they create American jobs, raise wages, and improve our national security. After looking at the final terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, including what it contains on currency manipulation and its weak rules of origin standard for what counts as a car that can get treaty benefits, she opposed the agreement because it did not meet her test. And she will hold every future trade agreement to the same high standard.\n* Review the trade agreements we already have on the books.Clinton has said for almost a decade that we need to renegotiate NAFTA, and she still believes that today. She would review all of our trade agreements with the same scrutiny.\n* Fight for American exports.U.S. exports total more than $2 trillion dollars and exporters pay workers higher wages. Clinton will support the efforts of businesses large and small to tap new markets – both at home and internationally – to support good paying jobs and spur economic growth. That is why she stands for American workers in the face of misguided opposition by supporting the Export-Import Bank, and other policies that drive American exports.", "timestamp": "2016-04-11", "title": "Hillary Clinton Condemns Unfair Chinese Action on Steel Production, Pledges to Take On Chinese Trade Abuses as President"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122637", "text": "Tomorrow, on Equal Pay Day, President Obama will designate a new national monument at a historic location in Washington, D.C., to honor the movement for women's equality. The new Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument will protect the iconic house that has served as the headquarters for the National Woman's Party since 1929. From this house, known in recent years as the Sewall-Belmont House, members of the Party led the movement for women's equality, authoring more than 600 pieces of federal, state and local legislation in support of equal rights.\nTomorrow's designation will permanently protect one of the oldest standing houses near the U.S. Capitol and help preserve an extensive archival collection that documents the history, strategies, tactics and accomplishments of the movement to secure women's suffrage and equal rights in the United States and across the globe.\nThe new monument is named for former Party president, activist and suffragist Alva Belmont, who was a major benefactor of the National Woman's Party, and Alice Paul, who founded the Party and was the chief strategist and leader in the Party's ongoing fight for women's political, social, and economic equality.\nAfter playing an instrumental role in the passage and ratification of the 19th Amendment guaranteeing women's suffrage, Paul led the Party's advocacy work from the house, including drafting updated Equal Rights Amendment text, writing provisions that were later included in the Civil Rights Act to prevent discrimination on the basis of gender, and working to get women's equality language incorporated in the U.N. Charter. A fierce advocate for women's equality her entire life, Paul died in 1977 at the age of ninety-two.\nEfforts to protect the site date back to the early 1970s, and more recent proposals to include the site in the National Park System have garnered Congressional support – including bipartisan legislation introduced by Senator Mikulski – as well as strong support from local elected officials, community leaders, women's organizations, conservation groups and historians. The National Park Foundation will announce that David Rubenstein is contributing $1 million dollars to support the site and address immediate restoration needs.\nIn 1997, the National Woman's Party became an educational organization and today, seeks to educate the public about the ongoing women's rights equality movement.\nIn addition to protecting more land and water than any President in history – more than 265 million acres – President Obama has sought to protect places that are diverse, culturally and historically significant, and that reflect the story of all Americans. By honoring the history and accomplishments of the movement for women's equality, tomorrow's designation will build on this effort towards a more inclusive National Park System and tell the story of women's fight for equality for generations to come. Our national parks and other protected sites that represent America's diverse history and culture will continue to be an important priority for the Administration as the country celebrates the National Park Service Centennial this year.\nAbout Equal Pay Day\nTomorrow we observe Equal Pay Day – the date in the current year that represents the extra days a typical woman working full-time would have to work just to make the same as a typical man did in the previous year. Since taking office, President Obama has made equal pay a top priority and has taken a number of steps to fight for pay equity. In addition to signing his first piece of legislation as President, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, President Obama has created the National Equal Pay Task Force, called on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, issued an Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against employees who discuss or inquire about their compensation, and worked with the Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to better target enforcement of equal pay laws though enhanced employer reporting of pay data.\nTo highlight key gender equality issues and set the agenda for the future, next month, the White House will host a Summit on \"The United State of Women\" together with the Department of State, the Department of Labor, the Aspen Institute, and Civic Nation. The summit will create an opportunity to mark the progress made by and for women and girls domestically and internationally over the course of this Administration and to discuss solutions to the challenges they still face. The Summit is being held with additional cooperation from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women, the Tory Burch Foundation and the Ford Foundation.\nBuilding on Steps to Help Women in the Workforce and Working Families\nPresident Obama has taken a number of actions to combat the pay gap, as well as other issues that affect women in the workforce, including:\n•      Working with the Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in January 2016 to publish a proposal to annually collect summary pay data by gender, race, and ethnicity from businesses with 100 or more employees, potentially covering over 63 million employees. This step will help focus public enforcement of our equal pay laws and provide better insight into discriminatory pay practices across industries and occupations. The Council of Economic Advisers also released an issue brief, \"The Gender Pay Gap on the Anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act,\" that explores the state of the gender wage gap, the factors that influence it, and policies put forward by this Administration that can help address it.\n•      Signing a Presidential Memorandum in May 2013 directing the Office of Personnel Management to develop a government-wide strategy to address the gender pay gap in the federal workforce, leading to a report in April 2014 and new guidance in July 2015—which cautioned against required reliance on a candidate's existing salary to set pay, as it can potentially adversely affect women who may have taken time off from their careers or propagate gaps due to discriminatory pay practices by previous employers.\n•      Issuing an Executive Order in April 2014 and publishing a Department of Labor rule in September 2015 prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against employees who discuss or inquire about their compensation.\n•      Hosting the first-ever White House Summit on Working Families in June 2014, highlighting the issues that women and families face, setting the agenda for a 21st century workplace, and announcing of a number of steps to help working families thrive.\n•      Signing a Presidential Memorandum in January 2015 directing federal agencies to advance six weeks of paid sick leave to federal employees with new children, calling on Congress to grant another six weeks of paid leave for federal employees, and calling on Congress to pass legislation that gives all American families access to paid family and medical leave.\n•      Issuing an Executive Order in September 2015 requiring federal contractors to provide employees working on federal contracts up to seven paid sick days each year—and urging Congress, states, cities, and other businesses to do the same.\n•      Publishing a proposed Department of Labor rule in June 2015 updating outdated overtime regulations, which, if finalized, would expand overtime pay protections for nearly 5 million Americans, promoting higher take home pay, and allowing workers to better balance their work and family obligations.\n•      Issuing an Executive Order in February 2014 requiring federal contractors to raise their minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and lift the tipped minimum wage (which disproportionately impacts women)—and urging Congress, states, cities, and businesses to do the same.\n•      Issuing an Executive Order in July 2014 and publishing a Department of Labor rule in December 2014 prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating in employment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n•      Directing the Office of Personnel Management and federal agencies to enhance workplace flexibility for federal employees to the maximum extent practicable, including enshrining a right to request flexible work arrangements.\n•      Calling on Congress to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which would require employers to make reasonable accommodations to workers who have limitations from pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions (unless it would impose an undue hardship on the employer). The legislation would also prohibit employers from forcing pregnant employees to take paid or unpaid leave if a reasonable accommodation would allow them to work.\n•      Publishing a proposed Department of Labor rule that, if finalized, would update its sex discrimination guidelines for federal contractors for the first time since 1978, to align with current law and address barriers to equal opportunity and pay, such as pay discrimination, sexual harassment, hostile work environments, a lack of workplace accommodations for pregnant women, and gender identity and family caregiving discrimination.\n•      Increasing investments to expand access to high-quality early care and education, including efforts under the Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge program, Preschool Development Grants, Head Start and Early Head Start, and a landmark proposal that helps all eligible working families with young children afford high-quality child care.\n•      Expanding access for women to higher-paying jobs through a proposed rule updating equal employment opportunity requirements in registered apprenticeships and through a Mega-Construction Projects (MCP) Initiative at the Department of Labor.\nAdditionally, the President's Council of Economic Advisers has continued to spotlight the pay gap and other challenges women face in the workforce as well as policy solutions proposed by the Administration to address these persistent challenges.

Women in the United States still do not always receive equal pay for equal work. When women are paid less for doing the same jobs as men, it undermines our most fundamental beliefs as Americans. Every year, we mark how far into the new year women would have to work in order to earn the same as men did in the previous year, and on this day, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring equal pay for all.\nAlthough small gains have been made in recent years, the typical woman working full-time, year-round earns only 79 cents for every dollar earned by the typical man, and women of color earn even less relative to the typical white, non-Hispanic man—60 cents on the dollar for the typical black woman and 55 cents on the dollar for the typical Hispanic woman. Women are increasingly the breadwinners of American households, and when they are not paid equally, or are underrepresented in certain higher-paying occupations, their ability to save for retirement is hindered and hardworking families face greater difficulty meeting their basic financial needs. Pay discrimination puts greater strain on families to cover costs like child care or health care, and it holds our economy back from achieving its full potential. We must continue taking action to address issues of equal pay, pay secrecy, pregnancy discrimination, and unconscious bias. The gender pay gap in the United States is among the largest of many industrialized nations, and because women make up nearly half our workforce, this disparity impacts us all. The pay gap between men and women offends our values as Americans, and as long as it exists, our businesses, our communities, and our Nation will suffer the consequences.\nMy Administration is dedicated to reaching a day in which all women are paid equally for their work. Earlier this year, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in partnership with the Department of Labor, announced a new proposal to gather pay data by race, ethnicity, and gender from businesses with at least 100 employees. This will help businesses make sure their employees are being treated equally, and it will help us enforce existing equal pay laws. This proposal originated in part with my National Equal Pay Task Force, which has helped coordinate a Federal effort to crack down on violations of equal pay laws. Our Nation has taken significant steps toward achieving pay equity over the last 7 years—from the first piece of legislation I signed as President, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which makes it easier for women to challenge unequal pay, to my Executive Order prohibiting Federal contractors from discriminating against employees who discuss their compensation. But much work remains to be done, which is why I continue to call on the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act—a commonsense measure that would bolster the ability of women to fight pay discrimination.\nWhen all people know their country is invested in their success, we are all better off. Together, we must rid our society of the injustice that is pay discrimination and restore the promise that is the right of every American: the idea that with hard work, anyone can reach for their dreams and know no limits but the scope of their aspirations. On National Equal Pay Day, we renew our belief in equal pay for equal work, and we rededicate ourselves to building a future in which women are paid based on their merits. Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 12, 2016, as National Equal Pay Day. I call upon all Americans to recognize the full value of women's skills and their significant contributions to the labor force, acknowledge the injustice of wage inequality, and join efforts to achieve equal pay.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-11", "title": "Proclamation 9422—National Equal Pay Day, 2016"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117069", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:55 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. You seem pretty cheery today, which I'm pleased to hear. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to questions.\nKathleen, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. I just wanted to go back to the President's remarks this morning. He inched a little closer to perhaps endorsing Hillary Clinton, with his comments about future generations being surprised that a woman could hold the Oval Office. Is that what he meant by that? Again, leaning into the idea that he's rooting for her.\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President was leaning into the idea of a value statement, that the United States is a country where people who work hard and are willing to play by the rules are not going to be limited by their last name or what they look like or their religion or even their gender, but rather that America is a place where if you work hard, your dreams can come true. And the President wants to preserve that promise for future generations.\nThe President has certainly talked about that quite a bit and certainly when it comes -- and it certainly applies to the scenario when women are competing for the highest elected office in the land, and that they should be evaluated based on their ideas and their values and their agenda. And it's the kind of country I think that we all aspire to, and that certainly is the value that the President was giving voice to today.\nQ: So is he ready to see a woman President?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President indicated in his remarks that the country is ready for that. But the candidates are going to be evaluated based on their values and on their priorities and on their agenda. Well, look, there already has been a tough debate already about who the next President will be, and that debate will only intensify in advance of November. And that's the way that we're going to choose our next President. And the President will be an eager participant in that process.\nQ: And then one more on politics. There is an announcement of remarks coming from Speaker Ryan later this afternoon, as I'm sure you're aware. Do you think Democrats should be preparing for the possibility that he could be the Republican nominee?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's my understanding that the meeting that Speaker Ryan has convened is to assure everybody, including Democrats, that people don't need to be concerned about the prospect of him running for President anytime soon, at least not this year. But I'll let him speak for himself about his own plans.\nI think Democrats are going to have a forceful argument to make, and the President will be part of making that argument. In some ways, he already has been. But there will be plenty of time to consider exactly how that argument lines up and who the candidates will be over the course of this year. And Republicans have their own process that's established for nominating a candidate for President. They have their own set of rules that guide how that process will work. And I understand that Speaker Ryan is the chair of the Republican convention, so he certainly -- I suspect he's spent a little time brushing up on the finer points of those rules over the last few weeks. And ultimately, it will be up to Republicans to decide who they want to represent their party in the general election.\nQ: So Democrats should take that at face value? They should not do any preparation or at all be ready for the --\nMR. EARNEST: I think that Speaker Ryan is hoping that everybody will take him at face value when he delivers his comments later today. But I'll let him speak for himself.\nQ: And just one more, looking ahead to next week. I assume the White House is following sort of the fallout from the Panama Papers and that Cameron has been caught up in some discussion. I'm wondering if you could just tell me whether or not the White House is following that and if we should expect the President to defend the Prime Minister in any way on this front when he's there next week.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that the White House has been following this story. There's been a lot of reporting that's been generated by journalists who have analyzed the data that was released. And in some cases, this has caused politicians in places like Iceland and China and, yes, some places in Europe who have been connected to that information in one way or another. I know what Prime Minister Cameron has done is he's released an unprecedented amount of information about his taxes in order to help his constituents understand exactly what has taken place.\nI don't know to what extent that will satisfy the inquiries that he and his office have received. But the argument that the President made when speaking from this podium last week is that the United States has been a strong advocate of greater transparency in the international financial system. And there are a number of steps that the Obama administration has advanced in pursuit of that goal, but there obviously is more work that we believe can be done. This is an important principle because we know that there are bad actors that capitalize on the opaque nature of some international financial transactions to try to launder money, to evade U.S. sanctions, and to store the profits of corruption.\nSo greater transparency into those transactions would enhance the ability of the United States and our international partners to combat those efforts. So we're going to continue to advocate for transparency. And it sounds like Prime Minister Cameron has opted for greater transparency to help the British people understand exactly his role in this story. And I don't know whether or not this will continue to be the topic of intense interest when President Obama travels to London next week. I would anticipate that while the President is in London, he'll have an opportunity to take questions from all of you, and we'll see at that point whether or not you and your British counterparts consider this to be a relevant, newsworthy topic at that point.\nQ: Another likely topic will be Brexit. Can you describe whether or not the President -- what we should expect from him on that front, and whether or not he's at all concerned about meddling or weighing in too much on an issue --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any specific set of remarks to preview for you. The position that we have previously expressed is that the United States benefits from a strong UK that's part of the EU. And ultimately, the British people will have to decide exactly what they want the future to hold with regard to their country's relationship with the rest of Europe.\nAnd I think that, in any case, the President will respect the sovereignty of the UK and the right of the British people to make that determination. But when the President is taking questions from the press corps, I wouldn't be surprised if this is at that point considered a newsworthy topic that comes up.\nTim.\nQ: I want to talk about Brazil a little bit. Lots of difficult news as Brazil -- more votes expected on impeachment proceedings for President Rousseff in coming days. And then today, the IMF downgraded its forecast of the economy -- going to shrink 3.8 percent this year instead of 3.5 percent. Just wondering how the White House -- how concerned is it that these economic problems could hit the U.S. eventually.\nMR. EARNEST: I did not see the news about the new economic assessment from the IMF. But the kinds of political challenges that's facing the government in Brazil does not typically have a positive impact on the broader economic outlook of the country. So I'm not surprised to hear that assessment from the IMF.\nI don't think any of the developments, either in the political realm or in the economic realm, have changed the President's assessment of the situation there. When the President did his news conference in Argentina alongside President Macri, the President voiced his confidence in the durability of the Brazilian government and Brazilian democracy to weather the political crosswinds that they're enduring right now. And the President had confidence in the ability of that governing system to resolve the concerns that have been raised and allow the Brazilian government and the Brazilian people to move forward. They obviously have a busy summer ahead. There are Olympic Games that they're preparing to host that will put Brazil in the spotlight.\nAnd we certainly are hopeful that the British government will be able -- or that the Brazilian government will confront these challenges, will deal with them according to the rules that are codified in their constitution and in their system of government, and move forward in a way that can, over the longer term, begin to strengthen their economy.\nObviously, when you have a country as large as Brazil that has as many economic ties with the United States, it's in our interest to see their economy strong. It's in our interest to see the country's economy develop in a way that they can continue to be an important trading partner with the United States. Prior to the President's trip to Brazil in the first term of his presidency, we spent a decent amount of time talking about how important those economic ties were, and how direct the consequences are for our trade relationship, both here in the United States when it comes to our economy, but also the impact that it has on the economy of Brazil.\nBut, look, even in light of the developments that you have cited, the United States and President Obama himself have confidence in the durability of the Brazilian democracy to weather those challenges.\nQ: And I know you haven't seen all the details of the IMF -- the wider IMF report today, but they're also quite gloomy about the global economy. Japan, Russia and Brazil all don't pan out too well. How worried is the White House that if this continues it will lead to more global protectionist sentiment?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, over the last couple of years, the President's economists have noted that the chief headwinds to the U.S. economy right now are emanating from overseas. There is a direct impact on the U.S. economy that is deeply integrated with the global economy when we see some of our partners encounter some economic difficulties.\nBut this also goes to the argument that the President himself has made quite a bit, recently, that the United States has an economy that's the envy of the world -- that the United States' economy is durable, that the United States' economy is strong. And the investments that -- and the strategy that we committed to in the President's first couple of years of his presidency are now reaping significant benefits for the American people and the American economy.\nThat's a good thing. And it is what makes the U.S. economy the envy of the world. And the President's view is that even in this situation where some of our significant trading partners are encountering some economic difficulties, this would be exactly the wrong time to retrench. What we should be doing is helping U.S. businesses look for additional opportunities overseas.\nWe know that's good for our broader economy. It's good for creating jobs. It's good for economic growth. We know that actually places upward pressure on wages -- that jobs in the United States that are tied to exports actually pay higher, on average, than the typical American job. That is all the more reason that we should be looking for additional opportunities to help American businesses do business overseas.\nAnd that's one of the reasons that the President continues to be an ardent advocate of congressional approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This would expand the ability of U.S. businesses to engage in commerce with countries in the Asia Pacific region, some of whom are the most economically dynamic countries in the world.\nAnd that is the path to the kind of economic growth and success that the President would like to see the United States enjoy over the long term.\nJustin.\nQ: While the President was speaking at UChicago last week, he said that he saw encryption as one of the major judicial issues of the time, and judges sort of sorting out the difference between privacy and security. And so I'm wondering if that's another signal, especially in light of the draft that's been circulating on Capitol Hill and leaked in part last week, that the President prefers Congress not act here, and that this issue be sort of decided in combination between the courts and the sort of broader national conversation he's talked about and you've talked about.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just restate the principle -- and I think it's worth doing. The President believes in strong encryption. He believes that strong encryption has important value both for our economy and our national security. He also believes that strong encryption can be critical in protecting privacy. All those are good things. All those are things that the President strongly believes. And it's why he believes that strong encryption should be robustly deployed.\nAt the same time, we should not set up a situation where bad actors -- terrorists -- can essentially establish a safe haven in cyberspace. And I recognize, and the President recognizes, that there is some tension in those principles. And resolving that tension both in the near term, but also over the longer, will be challenging. And one of the reasons that that will be challenging is not just because these are principles that are really important, but these are also principles that we're trying to enforce in a very dynamic environment. Technology companies are regularly innovating and finding new ways to encrypt information. And ensuring that we have a policy and a resolution of those two principles that can adapt to that ever-changing environment will be critical to the long-term success of this policymaking process.\nWhat I will say is, after describing how complex that situation is, I'll just observe that there are some quite simple things that Congress has struggled to do. I think the example that's at the front of my mind today is, the administration two months ago put forward a specific, documented requested for $1.9 billion in funding to fight Zika. This is a virus that we know threatens pregnant women and their newborn children. This is a virus that our scientists and public health professionals are increasingly worried about. But yet we haven't seen Congress do anything on a common-sense matter of public health and public safety. That's quite a disappointment, and I think it reflects the level of dysfunction in Congress right now, particularly because we see too many Republicans dragging their feet to act on what should be a rather common-sense piece of legislation.\nThat does diminish my expectations when it comes to assessing Congress's ability to tackle something as complicated as an encryption policy.\nQ: Well, does that mean that you don't think Congress will pass something? And whether they have not passed Zika funding or not taken a vote on your Supreme Court justice, do you think that they are not capable of passing legislation that adequately addresses this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: I think both are in doubt. Both their ability to pass legislation and their ability to put together constructive legislation that would pass are both questions that are significantly in doubt.\nQ: Russia and Saudi Arabia have reportedly reached an agreement to freeze oil production. So I'm wondering if that's something the U.S. was in touch with Saudi Arabia about, if it's something that we expect to hear about next week, because it kind of cuts both ways economically. Because it would probably increase gas prices, but could give a boost to the U.S. energy sector -- whether this is an agreement that the White House supports.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the news reports about this. I have been asked about previous news reports hinting at an agreement like this that did not prove to -- that didn't pan out and that didn't prove to be true. So why don't we take a closer look at this specific news report before commenting on it. But we'll take a look and get back to you.\nQ: And one last one. Is it fair to read the President's comments earlier today that female soccer players should have their work equally valued as an endorsement of the U.S. Women's National Team's complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission? And if so, or even if it's more of a broad push by the President, does he think there should be any sort of change in U.S. soccer since women are paid dramatically less than males?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the point of the President's remarks today was just to acknowledge the facts of that specific situation. What sort of ruling is handed down by the EEOC is something that the commissioners there will have to conclude on their own. I think the President is just sort of acknowledging the paid disparity that exists in a variety of professions, including when it comes to the best soccer players in the world. And that's what the President was alluding to.\nQ: On the U.S. National Team, as the President of the United States, would he like to see something change at U.S. soccer, whether it be leadership or whether it be them adopting a different pay structure?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I haven't talked to him about this specific issue. And I'm certainly not versed in all of the policies that may govern the setting of salaries for the men's and women's team. I think the President's observation today, however, is that there is a significant disparity based solely on the gender of the players, and that seems unfair. What consequences that has for policy decisions that eventually have to be made, I'll acknowledge that I don't know what that policy process is. But I think that disparity and the inherent unfairness of that disparity I think is pretty obvious to anybody who's been paying attention -- and the President has been paying attention.\nBill.\nQ: Does the President think that the CPT joke shared by Secretary Clinton and Mayor de Blasio is in poor taste?\nMR. EARNEST: I will admit, Bill, I didn't see the joke that you're referring to.\nQ: CPT was used as basically a racial reference, but they claim that it was actually a politician reference. But questions have been raised about the propriety of the use of the phrase.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's hard for me to comment on it because I just haven't --\nQ: Is he aware of it?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure that the President is aware of it. I haven't spoken to him about it.\nQ: Why don't you ask him?\nMR. EARNEST: Okay, will do.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Does the President believe that, before now, Americans were ready for a female President, or just now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has believed for some time that the country is ready for a woman President.\nQ: This is not novel, this is not America is finally getting it right? He feels like this has always been the case?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know if it's always been the case, but I think it has been the case for some time now that the country is ready for a woman to be elected President of the United States. Look, for the reason that the President traveled to this location, this newly designated national monument, is to acknowledge the fact that for more than our country's history -- if I'm doing the math right; I think I am -- for more than half of our country's history, women were denied the right to vote. And that certainly is going to inhibit the ability of a woman to serve as President of the United States. But only because of the progress that many women -- and men -- fought for, we have made our country more fair, that we have made our country more just, and we certainly have enhanced the justice that is built into our voting system.\nAnd it is only because of that hard-won progress that we have reached a situation more recently that it is possible for a woman to be elected President of the United States, that that's a practical reality. That's a good thing. And that reflects what our founders envisioned in terms of forming a more perfect union.\nNow, the irony is that we see too many Republicans on the other side of aisle trying to use the voting system to make it harder for Americans, who are otherwise eligible to vote, to cast a ballot. And that's moving in the wrong direction.\nAnd the irony is and the disappointment is that some Republicans have acknowledged that this is a purely -- that they have a purely partisan motive for trying to erode the progress that we have made in our system of voting. And that's something that we need to improve.\nQ: Does the President feel like he's done -- well, let me ask this way: Is he satisfied from Ledbetter to today in the advancement that he has made to ensure equal pay for equal work? And if he's dissatisfied, what's the source of that dissatisfaction? And what's he doing about it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the President has taken a number of steps since being elected President to try to make equal pay for equal work a reality in this country. And you alluded to the fact that the very first bill that the President signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. That made it easier for workers to get access to information and to take their case to court to ensure that they were being treated fairly by their employer.\nBut the President has done a number of other things, including creating the National Equal Pay Task Force. He has advocated for the passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act. The President issued even an executive order that prohibits federal contractors from discriminating against employees who inquire about their level of compensation. And we've been working closely with both the Department of Labor and the EEOC to better target the enforcement of equal pay laws. There are already some rules that are on the books that could be effectively used to ensure that people are being treated fairly.\nThe President has often made the case that this isn't just an issue for women; that a lot of the women who are being discriminated against in the workplace and are not getting the same amount of pay for their work that their male colleagues are getting are women who are part of two-paycheck households. They have a husband who is also working hard trying to put food on the table, and they've got kids that they're trying to provide for.\nSo this isn't just a women's issue. This is a families' issue. And it's among the reasons that the President has been such an ardent advocate of this policy because his top domestic priority has been to expand economic opportunity for the middle class. And if we're going to do that successfully, we need to make sure that those families that require or rely on two paychecks to pay the bills, that both of those paychecks are fair.\nQ: So what grade are we talking about? An \"A\"? A \"B\"? An \"I\" for incomplete?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, there are a lot of people who can observe the progress that we've made, and I'll let them draw their own conclusions. But certainly the President is proud of the progress that we have made to make our country more fair, to make sure that that fairness actually shows up in the paycheck every month.\nQ: How interested is the President in declassifying the 28 pages of the 9/11 Joint Report?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President is certainly somebody who has advocated for reforms to our country's classification system. You'll recall back in 2009, the President issued an executive order that essentially established the National Declassification Center that would expedite the consideration for declassification of a number of government records. There's also an effort underway to establish an open and uniform system for placing controls on sensitive but unclassified information so we can ensure that information is handled appropriately when it's sensitive, but also that we can live up to the President's commitment to transparency that should apply even in a national security setting.\nI can't tell you whether or not the President has read these 28 pages. I can tell you that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is currently doing a declassification review of those pages. And the President certainly has confidence in the ability of those national security professionals to consider those documents for release.\nQ: You said you can't tell me if he has read them. Has he been asked? Have you asked him personally? Has he taken a look? This is in news. He's insatiably curious. I imagine that he has access, that he probably has seen them, no?\nMR. EARNEST: I just -- I don't know whether or not he's --\nQ: You haven't had a chance to ask him?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not asked him about that.\nQ: I'd appreciate if you get the opportunity, I'd certainly like to get --\nMR. EARNEST: Got a long list of questions for him today, I guess here, huh? (Laughter.)\nQ: Yes. Double work. Just one last button-up on that one. Given the suggestion -- and I'm reading it now and I've read almost all of the 858 pages -- that there is a section that is not classified that reads in part: \"The joint inquiry developed information suggesting specific sources of foreign support for some of the September 11th hijackers while they were in the United States.\" It has also been alleged or suggested by some that that support may have come, in fact, from the Saudi leadership in the kingdom. Ahead of the trip there, do you suspect this will be part of the conversation? And have you heard an allegation such as the one I've just offered?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this something -- this actually was an allegation that was considered by the 9/11 Commission. This was the outside group that was formed. And there were national security experts who investigated 9/11 and issued a report both chronicling what they knew about what happened, and proposing a set of reforms that they encouraged the government to implement to try to prevent it from happening in the future.\nA part of the conclusion of that report states: \"Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of al Qaeda funding. But we have found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization.\"\nSo there already has been a close look at the kind of support that al Qaeda, including al Qaeda in the United States may have received. And this was included in a declassified 9/11 Commission Report that was released a number of years ago.\nQ: So it is not likely -- just to button it up -- that this will be a topic of conversation during the visit?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know whether or not this will come up. The fact that it's been in the news more recently might change that equation. But I think it's true that the people who have looked carefully at this, the experts who have looked carefully at this and put together the 9/11 report did not find any direct links between the Saudi government providing support, financial support to al Qaeda.\nQ: The senior Saudi government. They don't say anything about the junior Saudi government.\nMR. EARNEST: The Saudi government as an institution is the way they described it, and that's what I was referring to.\nJerome.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Secretary of State John Kerry said yesterday that everybody should visit Hiroshima. Does the President want to go to Hiroshima in May?\nMR. EARNEST: Does the President count as \"everybody\"?\nQ: Well, he said \"everybody,\" -- and I mean \"everybody,\" I quote him. Does the President want to go in May? And then how likely is it to happen?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update in terms of the itinerary of the President's trip to Asia in May. He obviously will be in Japan for the G7 summit there. And I don't know at this point whether or not any side trips will be on the President's itinerary.\nThe President, on previous trips to Japan, has sort of faced a question about whether or not to include a stop in Hiroshima. And look, the symbol of Hiroshima is the significant and even, in some ways, tragic ability that mankind has to wreak terrible destruction. And one of the reasons that the President has started and routinely convened a Nuclear Security Summit is in pursuit of a world without nuclear weapons. And that continues to be a long-term goal.\nThe President himself has indicated that that's unlikely -- that goal is unlikely to be achieved during his lifetime, but there certainly is progress that we can make in pursuit of that goal. And one place to start is by better safeguarding and securing nuclear weapon -- nuclear materials and nuclear-weapon technology that could spread and that could proliferate. That's been the point of the summit.\nSo obviously there's probably -- symbolically, there's no more powerful illustration of that commitment than the city that contained the victims of the first use of that weapon. But at this point, I don't have an update for you on his itinerary, but we'll keep you posted.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, another anti-transgender bathroom bill, much like the controversial North Carolina law, is percolating in Tennessee. The state attorney general, a Republican, said the measure could result in the loss of an estimated $1.2 billion for the state and Title 9 funding. Does the administration agree that the measure could result in loss of federal funding for the state?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a question that individual agencies have been considering after previous states have passed these bills into law. I don't know what mechanism is in place for individual agencies to consider those kinds of questions in advance of a law being passed, but you can check with the Department of Education for greater clarity on that.\nWhat I can tell you is that the administration is firmly committed to promoting and defending equal rights of all Americans, including LGBT Americans. And specific laws like this that seek to target and marginalize one small segment of the population is nothing less than mean-spirited. That was true when they passed similar provisions in places like North Carolina and Mississippi, and it's true even as it's being considered in a place like Tennessee.\nWhat's also true in Tennessee is that the state has thrived economically in part because of their ability to make their case to businesses across the country that they've got a great climate for doing business. Passing mean-spirited bills through the state legislature is not a good endorsement of your business climate. And ultimately, individual businesses will have to make their own decisions about this.\nI think what is also true is that states like Tennessee and, to a certain extent, North Carolina and Mississippi, have a long history even over the last couple of generations of working through questions of civil rights. And President Obama has talked on a number of occasions about the important progress that our country has made with regard to civil rights. This is a good illustration that the fight for civil rights is not over, and demanding equality for every American and ensuring that those Americans are not singled out or targeted because of their sex or their race or what their last name is, or their religion, or who they love or who they are is a struggle that continues. And the President, every time, is going to be on the side of equality and fairness and justice for every American.\nQ: The reviews for the federal agencies of the North Carolina and Mississippi laws remain ongoing. Do you have an expectation for when they'll be complete?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an expectation for that. You'll have to talk to the individual agencies about that. They're obviously coordinating their activities among themselves, and they're obviously doing this work in conjunction with the Department of Justice, because there are important legal questions that have to be resolved. But I don't have an update for you in terms of when that work will be concluded.\nSuzanne.\nQ: CNN interviewed former Mexican President Vicente Fox, obviously talking about Donald Trump and his proposals, his politics. It's not the first time he has criticized, saying that he's \"arrogant,\" he's \"egocentric,\" and he also called him a \"dictator.\" But he did have a message for the American people. He said, \"Wake up, America.\" Does the President feel as if the American people need to \"wake up\" during this election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President -- let me say a couple things about that. The first is that I think the President has observed in public on a number of occasions that he is confident that Mr. Trump will not be elected President. That's something that the President, himself, has said directly.\nMore generally, the reason that we have elections in this country is it's an opportunity for the American people to consider the values and agenda and track record of those who are competing for the highest elected office in the land. And the decision that is ultimately reached by the voters is one that has significant consequences. The American people have chosen to invest significant power and authority in the President of the United States, and making this decision is an important one. It's one that has significant consequences not just for the United States but for other countries around the world.\nAnd I think that's part of what -- it sounds like, at least -- I didn't see the interview, but it sounds like that's part of what President Fox was referring to. Again, ultimately the President will have an opportunity to make clear why he believes the Democratic nominee is the one that should be elected and is the one that he prefers. But he'll have an opportunity to make that case certainly once the Democratic Party has chosen a nominee, and presumably he will join that debate in earnest once the Republicans have chosen their nominee as well.\nQ: And interestingly, the Freedom of Information Act -- some of Bill Clinton's presidential papers were released today. And this was back in October of 1999, when there was a possibility that Donald Trump would be running in an independent party for President, for the nomination. And these are notes from his aides, President Clinton's aides, before he was preparing for a CBS News interview -- if asked about whether or not his own problems in the White House, his scandal, contributed to celebrities wanting to be President. And his aides said here, according to the notes, that he responds saying, \"I think it may say something about the way the media covers politics these days, but I have the utmost confidence in the American people to sort out the wheat from the chaff. Regardless of who runs for President or how they're covered, the public eventually sees through all the smoke and mirrors. They, after all, have the ultimate power at the ballot box.\"\nDoes President Obama see it that way? And what do you make of the fact that there's that argument that was made 17 years ago?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think it sounds like based on what you've read that President Clinton was expressing the same kind of confidence in the American people and the American voters that President Obama has routinely expressed confidence in. and it doesn't mean that every election goes down exactly the way the President would hope, but it does mean that, particularly in a national election that will get as much attention as the presidential election will, the President does continue to have an abiding confidence in the American people and in American voters to take their responsibility to choose the next President quite seriously and to do the diligent work required to make the best choice.\nQ: And finally, Defense Secretary Carter has formally notified Egypt and Israel that the U.S. is considering reconfiguring its resources in the Sinai by increasing its reliance on remote sensory technology as opposed to troops because of the threat of ISIS. Can you confirm that?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you is that the United States remains as committed as ever to the success of a multinational force and observers. This is part of the treaty that was signed between Israel and Egypt, and the United States has played an important role in ensuring the success of that treaty.\nAnd what is true is that since the decisions were made about how to observe that treaty and its entering into effect, there have been great advances in technology that will allow some of the work that is currently done by MFO forces in the Sinai to be supplemented with new technology. This has the potential to actually make this monitoring effort even more effective. And the changes that the Department of Defense is prepared to make are consistent with this desire to supplement our efforts with new technology.\nWhat sort of impact that has on the presence of the U.S. military in the Sinai Peninsula, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense on that. But I can tell you as a policy matter that the U.S. commitment to this treaty and this mission has never been stronger. And that's evidenced by the fact that the United States government is prepared to deploy new equipment and new technology to supplement the ongoing efforts of those forces that have been in the Sinai Peninsula for several decades now.\nQ: -- it's more dangerous on the ground for U.S. troops because of the threat of ISIS?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, we're aware of the threat from extremists in that part of the world. That threat has been in existence since those forces were deployed there. And there have been a number of steps that have been taken over the years to enhance the force protection measures that are in place. But the policy changes that are being implemented by the Department of Defense are a reflection of newly available technology that can ensure the success of this MFO operation.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about comments made by New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton after one of his players was shot dead over the weekend. He said, \"I hate guns.\" And he said, \"If that opinion in Louisiana is super unpopular, so be it.\" And that \"I guess the idea that we need them to fend off intruders, that's some silly stuff we're hanging on to.\" I'm wondering if the White House agrees with those comments, and if anyone from the White House has reached out to Sean Payton as a potential ally in your gun control efforts.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any conversations with Coach Payton about this specific issue. It sounds like he's somebody who was speaking from a position of great tragedy, and he clearly has lost a former player and somebody who he's said publicly meant a lot to him. And there's a lot of pain and emotion in that quote and in that expression.\nThe policy position that the administration has taken is somewhat different than that, but the administration has been forceful in advocating for the adoption of common-sense measures that would keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And we can do that in a variety of ways without undermining the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. And the President continues to be a forceful advocate for those kinds of policies.\nIt's unclear what exactly transpired on Saturday night that resulted in the death of Will Smith, the former New Orleans Saints football player. That situation is still under investigation. It's unclear whether or not a different policy could have prevented that loss of life. But, look, it does serve to illustrate that gun violence is too common in our society. And there are things that we can do to reduce that gun violence. We can't prevent every act of violence from occurring, but we can certainly take some common-sense steps that would reduce gun violence that don't undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. And the President believes strongly that those measures should be taken, and he's going to continue to advocate for them.\nOlivier.\nQ: Josh, I have a couple about classified information. The first, I'm trying to understand what you said, that the President is getting information from the news media about the ongoing troubles with Secretary of State Clinton's emails. He's never received an aide's assessment of the technical national security or political ramifications of this controversy?\nMR. EARNEST: I can tell you, Olivier, that the President has -- and I mentioned this yesterday -- but the President has neither asked for, nor received a briefing on the confidential elements of the ongoing investigation. Obviously, the President has talked about this issue publicly because he's read the newspaper and there have been many details of the case that have been reported publicly -- in large part because Secretary Clinton has asked that her emails in question be released publicly. And there are thousands, tens of thousands of pages of emails that all of you have combed through and reported on. And that has informed the President about the situation.\nThe President also can draw upon his own knowledge of her work there. But it is true that the President has not received a specific briefing -- and he hasn't asked for one -- on the confidential, ongoing investigation that's being conducted by the Department of Justice.\nQ: Okay. And then I was struck, watching the briefing yesterday, how much distance you put between the administration and the prosecution of leakers and whistleblowers and the like yesterday. Because when you talk about no one with politics in their job description shapes these investigations -- the President appoints the Attorney General; the President nominates a number of federal prosecutors. The President, as we've seen on immigration, has fairly wide latitude in deciding the priorities of prosecution, where these law enforcement resources go. How can you -- I mean, it really sounded to me yesterday like you were putting an enormous amount of distance between the President and those prosecutions. Can you elaborate on what you were trying to say?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess the point that I was trying to make -- and I was trying to be intentionally strong -- there is a question about this principle of whether or not criminal investigations are going to be conducted independent of political influence --\nQ: So individual ones, though, right? Because you're not disputing that the President sets the tone, the Attorney General sets the tone, there are guidelines? When Eric Holder enacts new guidelines covering the way the Justice Department will handle, say, reporters, in one of these cases, they're shaping the general tenor of these investigations, right? You're saying -- what you're talking about are individual ones, aren't you?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I'm not sure that I detect a --\nQ: Well, in principle versus in a specific case.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, this question -- well, let me say it more affirmatively. The President is committed -- as he described to Chris Wallace from Fox News, the President is committed to ensuring that individuals who have conducted criminal prosecutions do their work without influence from politicians or anybody that's involved in politics. Criminal prosecutions must be conducted and guided by the facts. They must be led in the direction that the evidence takes them.\nAnd that is the way that we can ensure that people can have confidence in our criminal justice system. If people feel like the facts of an investigation are not being guided by the evidence but are being guided by the politics, that's going to undermine our basic conception of justice. And it should. And that is true regardless of which party is in the White House. In fact, I think that's why there was so much concern raised in the previous administration when there was evidence that politics was interfering with decisions about hiring U.S. attorneys across the country -- that this goes to a core principle that is unique in America.\nI acknowledge that there are also other countries where we regularly travel where there is a little more tolerance for political influence in the criminal justice system and in the law enforcement system. We don't have that tolerance in this country.\nAnd I think the President -- I haven't looked recently at the President's remarks when he introduced Attorney General Lynch as his nominee for that important role, but it's worth going back -- and I'll do it when we're done here. I'm confident that one of the reasons the President chose her for this job is because of her career-long commitment to focusing on facts and evidence, and not considering politics when making law enforcement or prosecutorial decisions. She had a long track record of that because she was the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, where she handled a series of high-profile cases where politics threatened to intrude, and she was steadfast about preventing that from happening.\nSo I think that should be an indication both of the President's commitment to this principle, but also an indication that the President has chosen the right person for the job. The President has chosen somebody who doesn't just believe in this principle, but who, over the course of her career, has demonstrated a commitment to this principle even in a difficult environment.\nThere are some pretty high-profile criminal cases in New York that she was responsible for handling. And she has demonstrated throughout her career an ability to keep those political forces at bay and make sure that prosecutorial decisions were being made based on the facts and on the evidence, and not on politics. And that certainly is the expectation that the President has for the way that she does her job on a daily basis as Attorney General, and it's his expectation that that's the way that she and the investigators who are taking a look at Secretary Clinton's email system will do their job as well.\nDoes that answer your question?\nQ: No, but we can take this up later. I don't want to monopolize the rest of the briefing.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. I'm not trying to intentionally avoid answering your question.\nQ: I'm not impugning her record or her principles. I just don't know that there would have been this many prosecutions of this many leakers if this were not a priority of the President or the people that he nominates to key positions. So what I'm saying is that these -- you talked about these prosecutions yesterday in terms that to me, at least, sounded like you were trying to push them off and put them -- you said, well, some of these started in the previous administration, these are all independent prosecutors. And what I'm saying is, as we know from -- again, as we know from immigration policy, the President can set general principles for how these law enforcement resources are allocated. And so I just don't -- I just was not eager to let you push these off and say, essentially, these aren't really -- this is not our record, this is these anonymous provisional prosecutors doing this.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I guess the other way I could try to answer your question is to -- you sort of posed the\ncounterfactual, right? That if the President hadn't sort of raised this publicly as an issue of concern, protecting classified, sensitive national security information, that maybe the Department of Justice would have handled it differently.\nI guess the way that I would pose it back to you is, if there were evidence that the President were having those kinds of conversations with the Department of Justice, like that information is not really that important, you don't need to prosecute, that would be a huge story. That would be a huge problem. Because I think the question that you would rightfully raise is, did the President reach out to the Department of Justice and those prosecutors to raise concerns about the case because he didn't think the information was that sensitive? Or is it because this is an individual who voted for him or contributed to his campaign? Or somebody who had written an op-ed favorable of his national security policy?\nAny time that the President -- that there is evidence that a President would somehow intervene or try to influence the outcome of an individual prosecution would be a significant problem. And there would rightly be questions raised.\nSo as others were sort of entertaining the counterfactuals, I think the counterfactual that I would raise is, what if the President did express some preference on this? I think reasonably all of you would be really uncomfortable with that. As an American, I think I would be, too. Because I think the problem -- the concern that would be raised is, is this decision that's supposed to be made be a career federal prosecutor being made on the merits, or is it being influenced by a politician that may have an ulterior motive?\nQ: This is where the general principle versus an individual case distinction come in, for me.\nMR. EARNEST: But we can certainly continue this. And I think that there are --\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: The last thing I will say on this is that I have asked for more publicly available information about sort of what is often cited in terms of these questions about how the Department of Justice has chosen to pursue investigations of people who are accused of leaking classified information. And so we can talk about it in the briefing tomorrow, or in private tomorrow if everybody else is bored with this conversation. But there is more that I hope that I can present that we can discuss.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, is the NSC meeting tomorrow at CIA a decision-making meeting about ISIS strategy or just an update?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, tomorrow's meeting is consistent with the regular cadence of meetings that the President convenes with his national security team to take a look at our campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. The President typically uses these meetings where senior members of his team participate to get an update on how things are going. And those regular in-person updates are valuable to testing how effective the strategy is. And one of the keys to our success is going to be our ability to be nimble and to look for opportunities, and to detect opportunities early for investing more in certain elements of our strategy to try to yield additional progress.\nSo it's not uncommon for the President to make decisions in the context of these meetings. I don't know whether or not a decision will be announced in the context of tomorrow's meeting. But the President will deliver a statement at the conclusion of the meeting. And so you will get an opportunity to hear from him directly about what he believed was accomplished in the discussion.\nQ: On the subject of CIA, is there any White House reaction to the statement by Director Brennan that he would refuse a direct order from the President to engage water-board interrogation?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether I have a specific reaction to it --\nQ: Can you put that on your list of things to ask? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: -- but I'll try to at least address your question. Director Brennan was expressing his support for a value that he's long expressed, which is he believes that the national security of the United States is enhanced and is strengthened when we make clear that the United States doesn't torture people. And we certainly don't implement a policy that allows torture. And we don't send even an ambiguous signal that somehow the U.S. government might condone torture. That's the value that Director Brennan was standing up for in the context of that interview. And that's not the first time that he's done it.\nHe is somebody who, throughout his career, has recognized how important it is for our national security policy to reflect our values. And Director Brennen -- more eloquently than I am here -- can help you understand exactly why that is critical to the success of our country and critical to our national security. People look to the United States as a place where human rights are not just protected but championed. And implementing a policy and one that has been proven time and time again over the course of this presidency is that we can implement a policy, a national security policy that is consistent with our values, advances our interests, and keeps the American people safe.\nThe President is proud of that track record, and that track record was possible because of the enormous contributions of people like Director Brennan.\nQ: And lastly is there an impact on the President's trip next week by the new travel warnings about Saudi Arabia that were issued yesterday?\nMR. EARNEST: I saw the updated guidance that had been issued by the State Department. I believe that was actually consistent with guidance that they had issued six months ago when they were just renewing it. I would not anticipate that that would have any impact on the President's itinerary.\nJim.\nQ: Josh, in that Fox interview that was aired Sunday, the President also told Chris Wallace that his biggest regret was in driving Muammar Qaddafi from power in Libya without considering the vacuum in power that took place afterwards. Does he believe he bears any responsibility, along with the coalition allies, for the fact that Libya has become a breeding ground, base of operations for many militant organizations, including ISIS?\nMR. EARNEST: Jim, the President has acknowledged that the United States and certainly the Commander-in-Chief -- he does take some responsibility, along with our coalition partners, for failing to plan effectively for the situation in Libya after Colonel Qaddafi was removed from power. And there have been consequences for that failure. And the political and security turmoil that we've seen inside of Libya has been tragic, that there have been innocent lives that have been lost, including some brave Americans who are serving their country in Libya.\nBut what we have seen the United States and our coalition partners do is invest in and support a long-running U.N. process to try to rebuild the political structures inside of Libya. And there now is a Government of National Accord that is in Tripoli that is beginning to establish its rightful role as the government of Libya.\nBut that's been a long-running process. And the fact is this was an enormous challenge. Because Qaddafi had been in power for so long -- 42 years -- the civil society structures, the governmental structures of Libya were eroded away. And when he was removed from power there was no sort of structure to try to preserve order until a new leader of the country could be selected. It just meant that the government, and to a larger extent, the civil society in that country just disintegrated. And trying to rebuild all of that from scratch has been a painstaking effort, particularly when the people in that country are enduring the influence and destabilizing activities of extremists that are operating in their country.\nAnd so this has been a significant challenge. But we're pleased with the progress that has been made, particularly recently. And the United States is going to continue to play an important role in preventing ISIL from establishing a new safe haven in Libya that they could use to carry out attacks in the United States or in the nations of our allies. And that's why you've seen the United States and the Commander-in-Chief order some military action against ISIL targets in Libya to take them off the battlefield.\nSo those efforts have been important, but we've got a lot of work to do to try to bring the situation in Libya under control. It won't be a military solution, it will be a political solution, much like the one that we've seen make some progress in the last few weeks.\nQ: There have been instances where small numbers of U.S. Special Operations Forces have been on the ground in Libya in an advise-and-assist and a reconnaissance effort, if you will. But now that a government, an effective government seems to be forming, once that is a solid government entity, is the U.S. willing to commit any kind of ground forces there even in an advisory role eventually?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jim, I think it's far too early to consider that question, because I think what you will find is the United States is interested in partnering with the sovereign government, the newly established Government of National Accord in Libya. They obviously have their own self-interest in trying to combat the extremists that are operating in the country. They face some significant challenges in doing that because there are also a variety of militia groups across the country that make unifying the security presence in that country rather challenging, and that is going to have an impact on their ability to go after extremists that may be trying to establish a safe haven inside of Libya.\nI think it's too early at this point to offer up a specific policy proposition about what the United States will do down the road. But what we are committed to doing right now is showing our support for that government and, where necessary, taking military action to take prominent ISIL targets off the battlefield in order to protect the United States and our allies.\nQ: Would you say an increase in U.S. military activity in Libya is likely?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's -- look, I think U.S. military activities in Libya will be responsive to the threat that we face there. And that's why the President has ordered military action that, in one case, took out the senior ISIL official in Libya, in another case, took out a number of ISIL targets that had emerged in Libya. So we're going to continue -- the President will not hesitate to order military action were necessary, even in Libya, if it's necessary to take that action in order to protect the American people and our allies.\nQ: And has the Defense Department, Secretary Carter, Chairman Dunford yet presented to the Pentagon, to the President their request for additional ground forces in Iraq as I guess advise and assist -- in advise-and-assist roles?\nMR. EARNEST: I know there have been a number of reports about recommendations that some members of the President's national security team have given to the President. I'm not going to talk about the consultations between the President and members of his national security team. What I can tell you is that the President's direction to every member of his team is to look for opportunities to reinforce those elements of our strategy that are yielding the most progress. And the President has asked them to come to him with suggestions for how it is possible to reinforce those elements of our strategy that are showing the most success.\nThe President will consider those recommendations accordingly. And if we have any announcements to make, we'll let you know.\nArlette.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. In an interview yesterday with Mic news, Vice President Biden talked about how it's important what politicians say. He said, \"It matters what people say. It matters what your leaders say. It matters. Words matter.\" So based on that thought, I wanted to go back to Mayor de Blasio's joke about \"running on CP time.\" I know you say that you haven't seen this joke, but is it appropriate for politicians to be making jokes that hint at racially insensitive terms?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I don't think that there's anybody -- I haven't seen the joke and so I'm very reluctant to wade into this very far. But let me just say in general that certainly Mayor de Blasio and Secretary Clinton have over the course of their career demonstrated a genuine commitment to the pursuit of equality and justice and civil rights. And that's not just a talking point that they include on the campaign materials. That is something to which they have dedicated their careers in public service. So I can't speak to any misguided attempts at humor. I can only speak to their commitment that they've shown over the course of their career to justice and civil rights.\nQ: And tomorrow the Citizens Against Government Waste is going to release their annual Congressional Pig Book, outlining waste in government. Back in 2009, they determined there was close to $270 billion that could be saved. That number has gone up while the President has been in office. The last year the report said that it was $639 billion that could be saved. Does the White House think that they've done enough to promote cutting waste in government?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the administration certainly has made important strides in reducing waste from government spending. Oftentimes our efforts are set back by Congress continuing to fund programs and specific government actions -- well, I'd just say government programs that we believe are no longer necessary.\nAnd there are a number of reforms that the Department of Defense, for example, has routinely encouraged Congress to make that would save taxpayer dollars, that for political reasons members of Congress -- even Republicans -- haven't supported. And that's been a source of some disappointment.\nThere certainly is more that can be saved in terms of government spending. But the President has been serious about a commitment to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars. And the President is quite proud of the record that his administration has in cutting the deficit. We've cut the deficit by nearly three-fourths as a percentage of the economy since the President took office. We've made important progress in cutting wasteful spending, in eliminating old, outdated regulations that end up costing money unnecessarily. So the President's record on this is strong and one that he's quite proud of.\nDavid.\nQ: Josh, a few more questions on TPP. While we were talking -- while you were talking, the Secretary of State was in L.A., talking about the importance of the TPP on foreign policy. I think you said earlier in the briefing that the President is still very committed to getting TPP done. And the Peterson Institute has done studies about the economic impact and said we'd be leaving money on the table, the United States would, economically for each year that the TPP is delayed. Are you pressing Congress for a vote? What timetable are you looking at? And is getting Congress to vote on this before the summer recess off the table now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have a timeline to lay out. Obviously, individual members of the Congress, including many Republicans, have voiced their strong support for the agreement. They recognize both the national security and economic benefits that the American people would enjoy through the effective implementation of this agreement.\nWe've also seen strong support from outside organizations like the Chamber of Commerce, the Farm Bureau and others who typically don't support administration priorities who have leant their vocal advocacy to this policy. So we're going to continue to push Congress to implement this agreement, to act in bipartisan fashion to approve this agreement. And we're hopeful that they will.\nQ: Is the White House calling for a vote now, though? You're asking to have a vote on the Supreme Court justice. With immigration, you said just let it go forward for a vote, it's going to pass. Do you believe this agreement should go forward immediately?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are some additional steps in this process that have to be undertaken before we would be calling for Congress to vote on it. For example, I know that there is an economic impact study that is still being conducted, and there needs to be a formal presentation made by the administration to Congress before we can call on a vote. But even at that point, I know that there would be some consideration by congressional committee.\nSo there's an established process. It takes probably longer than we would prefer, but that's true of a lot of things when dealing with Congress. But at this point, what we are hoping to do is to continue to make a strong bipartisan case for congressional action to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Because we believe that effective implementation of that agreement would be good for our national security and good for our economy.\nQ: Do you have a -- like I said, the Secretary of State talking about the impact -- there was a conference call just a few weeks ago with a former general at the Pentagon saying how important this is. Do you believe that you're creating conditions in the country through these arguments in public that is improving the prospects for a big trade bill to go through? Or do you believe you're losing ground? And what does that mean if it's the latter?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think that's a difficult thing to assess. Obviously, many of the presidential candidates -- who are getting a lot of airtime themselves these days -- have not spoken favorably of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In some cases, they've spoken rather negatively of it.\nBut look, there is a strong, substantive case that this administration has and will continue to make about how the U.S. economy will benefit from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We're talking about 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American goods that would be cut through the implementation of this agreement. We're talking about an agreement that would raise labor standards, environmental standards and human rights standards in a variety of countries around the world. And we're talking about an opportunity that U.S. businesses would have to get access to countries that have very dynamic economies.\nSo there's a real opportunity to be seized here. And it would also have the effect of making progress in Southeast Asia, a place where we know that China would love to make progress. China is suggesting that they would like to go out and try to reach agreements with all of these countries, and gain a foothold -- or expand their influence in this region of the world. They would do so by lowering labor standards, by lowering environmental standards, and making it harder for U.S. businesses to compete on a fair playing field in this region of the world.\nSo it's pretty clear, both economically and strategically, why this deal makes sense for the United States. And we're going to make that case to Congress, to both Democrats and Republicans. And, yes, this may require some members of Congress tuning out the noise of the presidential election in order to focus on the merits of the agreement. When focused on the merits, we've got a particularly strong case.\nGeorge.\nQ: I want to follow on your earlier answer on Hiroshima. This morning, one of your predecessors, Dana Perino, retweeted something, saying \"President Obama wants to apologize for us winning World War II.\" Knowing that kind of criticism is likely and that people will talk about apologies and so on, is that a factor in the decision on whether to go?\nMR. EARNEST: It's not. The President has spoken on countless occasions -- I think most memorably at the 70th anniversary of D-Day -- about the debt of gratitude that all Americans owe to the Greatest Generation of Americans.\nAnd look, I didn't see the tweet that you're referring to, and I've made a habit to try to avoid criticizing my predecessors from here, so let me just say that the President will be focused on the policy considerations, and whatever decision he makes and whatever policy decision the administration makes will be consistent with the President's strong view about the bravery, courage and heroism of those Americans who fought and won World War II, thereby securing the liberty and freedom not just of the United States, but of human beings around the world.\nQ: Josh, what are the factors for the President to decide if he goes to Hiroshima or not? Is it public opinion, or is it visual, or a John Kerry recommendation? What are the factors?\nMR. EARNEST: This is a decision that -- this is a question about whether or not the President will visit Hiroshima that comes up regularly whenever the President makes plans to travel to Japan. The President has been to Japan I don't know how many times now, three or four times now, as President, and in advance of every trip this question has come up. So the President will -- and his team will obviously consider our options here. And once we've made a decision one way or the other, we'll be able to talk in a little bit more detail about why we've made the decision that we made.\nQ: Is the possibility about 50 percent, or more?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't put a number on it.\nTara, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Can you tell me a little bit more about the President's visit to London? You talked about it earlier. Maybe you can give me a sense --\nMR. EARNEST: A lot of interest in foreign travel today.\nQ: Exactly. Maybe you can give us a sense about what subjects will be discussed and what we should be thinking about before the trip.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll obviously have more to say about this later in the week as we get closer to the trip. I can tell you that the President strongly values the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. We partner on so many issues it would be difficult to enumerate all of them here at the end of the briefing. But I can tell you that President Obama has found Prime Minister Cameron to be an effective advocate for his country, but also an effective interlocutor for advancing the joint interests of our countries.\nSo I'm confident that there will be a discussion about our counter-ISIL campaign. Obviously, the UK is making important contributions, including military contributions, to our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. The United States and the United Kingdom have worked effectively to try to enhance homeland security in our two countries. We obviously work seamlessly to share intelligence information in a way that enhances our nation's national security.\nI would expect that the President will talk about the global economy. Obviously, the United Kingdom has a large economy that has significant influence on the global economy, and our efforts to strengthen our economic ties benefit the citizens in both of our countries.\nBut, look, there are also important cultural ties. And the President will have an opportunity to talk about that. And I know the President is very much looking forward to his visit. The President has been to the U.K. three or four times now, and I know he's enjoyed each visit. This will be his second visit to London, I believe, and he's hoping that it won't be consumed just with work, that he might get to have a little fun while he's there, too. But we'll have more details on his schedule later this week.\nThanks a lot, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:17 P.M.

Bernie Sanders on Tuesday contrasted his record to Hillary Clinton's stands on Wall Street reform, fracking, a corrupt campaign funding system and job-killing trade deals.\nMeanwhile, Clinton's credibility was questioned after she blamed Vermont for gun violence in New York. The charge backfired when The Washington Post called her assertion \"significantly misleading.\" Even Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Clinton backer, said she was wrong. \"It is campaign season, therefore, things are sometimes said by all the candidates that sometimes aren't entirely accurate,\" Shumlin told Vermont reporters.\nOn a host of other issues, Sanders detailed differences with Clinton during a rally here at Monroe Community College.\nSanders faulted Clinton's reliance on Priorities USA, one of her super PACs, which took $15 million in the last half of last year from Wall Street sources. That haul was part of $25 million showered on her by special interests. \"Our job is to stand up to these powerful special interests, not to take their money,\" Sanders said.\nHe doubled down on his call for Clinton to make public the transcripts of closed-door speeches on Wall Street that netted her millions of dollars in speakers' fees after she stepped down as secretary of state. The payments include $675,000 for three paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, which on Monday agreed to pay a $5 billion fine for marketing shady mortgage-backed securities before the housing bubble collapsed.\nRenewing his call for a nationwide ban on fracking, Sanders said Clinton has tried to masquerade her shifting stand on the extreme and risky method of drilling for oil and gas. \"When she was secretary of state she pushed fracking in countries all over the world,\" Sanders said. \"And she still has refused to come out firmly for a national ban on fracking.\" Sanders has launched a new television advertising campaign on fracking calling him the only candidate for president who would ban fracking everywhere.\nOn trade policy, Sanders said job-killing international trade deals backed by Clinton have shut down manufacturing plants across New York and thrown workers out of jobs that were shifted to Mexico, China and other low-wage countries. Sanders was a leader in the fight against the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. Hillary Clinton supported it. He later opposed normalized trade with China and other international trade pacts that she supported. \"I opposed every one of these disastrous trade agreements. Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one.

Emmer, R-MN, and 15 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3340, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act, which seeks to subject the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of Financial Research (OFR) to Congressional appropriations. The bill also would require the OFR to submit quarterly reports to the Congress regarding its activities and to provide a public notice and comment period of at least 90 days before issuing any report, rule, or regulation. Subjecting these bodies to Congressional appropriations would hinder their independence and could limit their ability to monitor and address threats to financial stability.\nThe Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform) created FSOC to bring independent regulators together with a collective responsibility for monitoring risks across the system, wherever they may arise, and to identify and respond to emerging threats to financial stability. Before FSOC, no single entity was accountable for monitoring and responding to risks to financial stability. Similarly, the OFR plays a unique role in promoting financial stability by identifying and filling in gaps in data and knowledge about the financial system, monitoring financial stability metrics across the system, conducting independent research on financial stability policies and providing FSOC with data and analytical support.\nWall Street Reform provided FSOC and the OFR with permanent funding through assessments on the largest financial institutions, including bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. This funding system ensures that large financial institutions bear the costs of protecting financial stability. Maintaining a funding source independent of political interference allows FSOC and the OFR to function at full capacity and focus on threats to financial stability. Moreover, funding FSOC and the OFR through appropriations would subject these entities to political gamesmanship that could hinder their ability to conduct independent research, ask questions, and analyze information about industries, firms, or activities — running the risk of ignoring the next threat to financial stability.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3340, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-04-12", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 3340 – Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act"}

Love, R-UT, and four cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3791, a bill that seeks to raise the consolidated assets threshold under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $5 billion.\nThe primary purpose of the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Policy Statement) is to make it easier for small banks to raise capital so they can continue to provide services to their local communities. The Policy Statement also ensures that when small, community institutions are purchased, they are more likely to be purchased by another community institution rather than a larger bank. Less than one year ago, the Congress reached a compromise to raise the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement threshold from $500 million to $1 billion. That change was intended to ensure that local communities retain access to the banks that best understand their needs and can provide personalized services to residents. Now, less than one year later, this piece of legislation seeks to raise that threshold again – to $5 billion – in an attempt to allow large banks to evade specific minimum leverage and risk?based capital requirements. These limitations were put in place to ensure that banks remain sound and able to serve their customers. Community banks with $1 to $5 billion in assets already have sufficient access to capital markets and as a group are exhibiting health and resilience. Raising the threshold to exempt banks with over $1 billion from important minimum leverage and capital requirements would do little more than encourage banks to take on debt, endangering their soundness and potentially depriving their customers of much needed banking services should the bank fail.\nSetting the consolidated assets threshold at $1 billion was a bipartisan decision that struck a balance between allowing small banks to access capital to better serve their customers, and ensuring their safety and soundness. Raising the threshold to $5 billion less than a year later would be an unnecessary and risky change.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3791, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-04-12", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 3791 – Raise the Consolidated Assets Threshold under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement"}

Kinzinger, R-IL, and 19 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2666, the No Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act, which would undermine key provisions in the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Open Internet order and harm the Commission's ability to protect consumers while facilitating innovation and economic growth.\nFor almost a century, our laws have recognized that companies that connect Americans to the world have special obligations not to exploit the gatekeeper power they enjoy over access in and out of our homes and businesses. The same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information, whether a phone call or a packet of data. The FCC's rules — issued after a lengthy rulemaking process that garnered an unprecedented amount of public input, including comments from four million Americans — recognize that broadband service is of the same importance, and must carry the same obligations as so many of the other vital services do. These carefully?designed rules have already been implemented in large part with little or no adverse impact on the telecommunications companies making important investments in our economy.\nH.R. 2666 is overly broad and extends far beyond codifying the FCC's forbearance from applying provisions of the Communications Act related to tariffs, rate approval, or other forms of utility regulation. Even as amended, H.R. 2666 would restrict the FCC's ability to take enforcement actions to protect consumers on issues where the FCC has received numerous consumer complaints. The bill also would hamstring the FCC's public interest authority to review transactions. H.R. 2666 also could limit the Commission's ability to address new practices and adapt its rules for a dynamic, fast-changing online marketplace.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2666, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-04-12", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 2666 - No Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act"}

Proclamation 9423, which established the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument, was signed on April 12.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117117", "text": "Thank you. Everybody, please, have a seat. Have a seat. Well, hello, everybody. Thank you to Chitra for the introduction. It should be noted that today is Equal Pay Day, which means a woman has to work about this far into 2016 just to earn what a man earned in 2015. And what better place to commemorate this day than here at this house, where some of our country's most important history took place and where this history needs to inform the work that remains to be done.\nI want to thank some of the leaders who've worked to keep the house standing. We've got Members of Congress like Senator Barbara Mikulski, who's fought to preserve this site for years and has been the longest serving woman in the United States Senate. We are so proud of her. Our Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, and her team, as we celebrate the 100th birthday of the National Park Service this year.\nOne of our greatest athletes of all time, one of the earliest advocates for equal pay for professional female athletes, and a heroine of mine when I was still young and fancied myself a tennis player—[laughter]—Billie Jean King is in the house. And the National Woman's Party Board of Directors, Page Harrington, and the Executive Director of the House and the Museum. Over the years, Page and her staff have built a community and cared for this house, repairing every cracked pipe and patching every leaked roof. [Laughter] We are grateful for their stewardship. I know it was not easy.\nEqual pay for equal work should be a fundamental principle of our economy. It's the idea that whether you're a high school teacher, a business executive, or a professional soccer player or tennis player, your work should be equally valued and rewarded, whether you are a man or a woman.\nIt's a simple ideal. It's a simple principle. It's one that our leader of the Democratic Caucus in the House, Nancy Pelosi, has been fighting for for years. But it's one where we still fall short. Today, the typical woman who works full time earns 79 cents for every dollar that a typical man makes. And the gap is even wider for women of color. The typical Black woman makes only 60 cents, a Latino woman 55 cents for every dollar that a White man earns. Now, if we truly value fairness, then America should be a level playing field where everyone who works hard gets a chance to succeed. And that's good for America, because we don't want some of our best players on the sidelines.\nThat's why the first bill that I signed as President was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Earlier this year, on the anniversary of that day, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor acted to begin collecting annual data on pay by gender, race, and ethnicity. And this action will strengthen the enforcement of equal pay laws that are already on the books and help employers address pay gaps on their own.\nAnd to build on these efforts, Congress needs to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to put sensible rules in place and make sure and make sure that employees who discuss their salaries don't face retaliation by their employers. But I'm not here just to say we should close the wage gap. I'm here to say we will close the wage gap. And if you don't believe me, then—[applause]—if you don't believe that we're going to close our wage gap, you need to come visit this house, because this house has a story to tell.\nThis is the story of the National Women's Party, whose members fought to have their voices heard. These women first organized in 1912, with little money but big hopes for equality for women all around the world. And they wanted an equal say over their children, over their property, their earnings, their inheritance; equal rights to their citizenship and a say in their government; equal opportunities in schools, in universities, workplaces, public service; and yes, equal pay for equal work. And they understood that the power of their voice in our democracy was the first step in achieving these broader goals.\nTheir leader, Alice Paul, was a brilliant community organizer and political strategist, and she recruited women and men from across the country to join their cause. And they began picketing 7 days a week in front of the White House to demand their right to vote. They were mocked. They were derided. They were arrested. They were beaten. There were force-feedings during hunger strikes. And through all this, women, young and old, kept marching for suffrage, kept protesting for suffrage.\nAnd in 1920, they won that right. We ratified the 19th Amendment. But the suffragists didn't stop there. They moved into this historic house, and they continued their work. From these rooms, steps away from the Capitol, they drafted speeches and letters and legislation. They pushed Congress and fought for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. They advocated for the inclusion of women in the U.N. Charter and the 1964 Civil Rights Act. They campaigned for women who were running for Congress.\nAnd this house became a hotbed of activism, a centerpiece for the struggle for equality, a monument to a fight not just for women's equality, but ultimately, for equality for everybody. Because one of the things we've learned is, is that the effort to make sure that everybody is treated fairly is connected.\nAnd so, today I am very proud to designate it as America's newest national monument, the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument, right here in Washington, DC. And we do this to help tell the story of these suffragists. In these rooms, they pursued ideals which shouldn't be relegated to the archives of history, shouldn't be behind glass cases, because the story of their fighting is our story. I want young girls and boys to come here, 10, 20, 100 years from now, to know that women fought for equality; it was not just given to them. I want them to come here and be astonished that there was ever a time when women could not vote. I want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women earned less than men for doing the same work. I want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women were vastly outnumbered in the boardroom or in Congress, that there was ever a time when a woman had never sat in the Oval Office.\nNow, I don't know how long it will take to get there, but I know we're getting closer to that day, because of the work of generations of active, committed citizens. One of the interesting things, as I was just looking through some of the rooms—there was Susan B. Anthony's desk. [Laughter] You had Elizabeth Cady Stanton's chair. And you realize that those early suffragists had preceded Alice Paul by a generation. They had passed away by the time that the vote was finally granted to women. And it makes you realize—and I say this to young people all the time—that this is not a sprint, this is a marathon. It's not the actions of one person, one individual, but it is a collective effort, where each generation has its own duty, its own responsibility, its own role to fulfill in advancing the cause of our democracy. That's why we're getting closer, because I know there's a whole new generation of women and men who believe so deeply that we've got to close these gaps. I have faith because what this house shows us is that the story of America is a story of progress. And it will continue to be a story of progress as long as people are willing to keep pushing and keep organizing and, yes, keep voting for people committed to this cause and to full equality for every American.\nAnd so I'm hoping that a young generation will come here and draw inspiration from the efforts of people who came before them. After women won the right to vote, Alice Paul, who lived most of her life in this very house, said, \"It is incredible to me that any woman should consider the right for full equality won. It has just begun.\" And that's the thing about America: We are never finished. We are a constant work in progress. And our future belongs to every free woman and man who takes up the hard work of citizenship to win full equality and shape our own destiny.\nThat is the story that this house tells. It is now a national monument that young people will be inspired by for years to come. It would not have happened without the extraordinary efforts of many of the people in this room, not only their active support of this house and preserving it, but also the outstanding example that they are setting, that you are setting.\nI'm very proud of you. Congratulations. Thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-04-12", "title": "Remarks on the Establishment of the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation and its attached annex were published in the  Federal Register  on April 15.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117120", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nThe Sewall-Belmont House (House), located at 144 Constitution Avenue, Northeast, in Washington, D.C.—a few steps from the U.S. Capitol—has been home to the National Woman's Party (NWP) since 1929. From this House, the NWP's founder Alice Paul wrote new language in 1943 for the Equal Rights Amendment, which became known as the \"Alice Paul Amendment,\" and led the fight for its passage in the Congress. From here, throughout the 20th century, Paul and the NWP drafted more than 600 pieces of legislation in support of equal rights and advocated tirelessly for women's political, social, and economic equality not just in the United States but also internationally.\nWhile the House's role in women's history makes it a nationally significant resource, the building itself has an interesting past. Robert Sewall constructed the House on Jenkins Hill, known today as Capitol Hill, around 1800. Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin used the House during the Jefferson Administration, and the House was the site of the only resistance to the British invasion of Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812. In retaliation, the British set fire to the House, but by 1820, Sewall had rebuilt it. The House remained in the Sewall family until 1922, when it was acquired by Vermont Senator Porter Dale.\nThe NWP purchased the House in 1929 to serve as its headquarters. The NWP named it the \"Alva Belmont House\" in honor of its former president and major benefactor who had helped purchase the NWP's previous headquarters. A prominent suffragist herself, Belmont said of the new headquarters, \"may it stand for years and years to come, telling of the work that the women of the United States have accomplished; the example we have given foreign nations; and our determination that they shall be—as ourselves—free citizens, recognized as the equals of men.\" What is now called the Sewall-Belmont House became the staging ground for the NWP's advocacy for an equal rights amendment and other significant domestic and international action for women's equality.\nAlice Paul, the women's suffrage and equal rights leader closely associated with the Sewall-Belmont House, led the NWP from its headquarters at the House from 1929 to 1972. A Quaker and well educated, before her work in the United States, Paul had been inspired by the women's suffrage movement in Britain in the early 20th century. During her years there from 1907 to 1910, she joined with Emmeline Pankhurst, her daughters, and other suffragettes to secure the vote for British women. Paul's participation in meetings, demonstrations, and depositions to Parliament led to multiple arrests, hunger strikes, and force-feedings.\nPaul brought home her focus on women's suffrage when she returned to the United States in 1910. After earning a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1912, she devoted herself to the American suffrage movement. She feared that the movement was waning at the national level because efforts had shifted to State suffrage. Paul believed that the movement needed to concentrate on the passage of a Federal suffrage amendment to the United States Constitution. Paul became a member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and by 1912 served as the chair of its Congressional Committee in Washington, D.C. In 1913, she and Lucy Burns created a larger organization, the Congressional Union of Woman Suffrage, which soon disagreed with NAWSA over tactics. The Congressional Union split from NAWSA in 1914 and evolved into the NWP through steps taken in 1916 and 1917.\nPaul was the most prominent figure in the final phase of the battle for the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1920, granting women the right to vote. As part of her strategy, she adopted the philosophy to \"hold the party in power responsible\" from her work on women's suffrage in Britain. The NWP withheld its support from the existing political parties until women gained the right to vote, and \"punished\" those parties in power that did not support suffrage. In 1913, the day before Woodrow Wilson's first inauguration, Paul organized a women's suffrage parade of more than 5,000 participants from every State in the Union. Through a series of dramatic nonviolent protests, the NWP demanded that President Wilson and the Congress address women's issues. The NWP organized \"Silent Sentinels\" to stand outside the White House holding banners inscribed with incendiary phrases directed toward President Wilson. The colorful, spirited suffrage marches, the suffrage songs, the violence the women faced as they were physically attacked and had their banners torn from their hands, the daily pickets and arrests at the White House, the recurring jail time, the hunger strikes which resulted in force-feedings and brutal prison conditions, the national speaking tours, and newspaper headlines all created enormous public support for suffrage.\nThrough most of the last century, the NWP remained a leading advocate of women's political, social, and economic equality. Following ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, the NWP, under the leadership of Alice Paul, turned its attention towards the larger issue of complete equality of men and women under the law. Paul reorganized the NWP in 1922 to focus on eliminating all discrimination against women. In 1923, at the 75th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, Paul proposed an equal rights amendment to the Constitution, which became known as the \"Lucretia Mott Amendment,\" and launched the campaign to win full equality for women. In 1943, Alice Paul rewrote the amendment, which then became known as the \"Alice Paul Amendment.\" What we now refer to as the \"Equal Rights Amendment\" was introduced in every session of Congress from 1923 until it finally passed in 1972, though it still has not been ratified by the required majority: three-fourths of the States.\nThroughout the 1920s and 1930s, the NWP drafted more than 600 pieces of legislation in support of equal rights for women on the State and local levels, including bills covering divorce and custody rights, jury service, property rights, ability to enter into contracts, and the retention of one's maiden name after marriage. It launched two major \"Women for Congress\" campaigns in 1924 and 1926 and lobbied for the appointment of women to high Federal positions. The NWP also worked for Federal and State \"blanket bills\" to ensure women equal rights and helped change Federal laws to equalize nationality and citizenship laws for women. The NWP fought successfully for the repeal of a statute that prohibited Federal employees from working for the Federal Government if their spouses also were Federal employees. The NWP helped eliminate many of the sex discrimination clauses in the \"codes of fair competition\" established under the New Deal's National Recovery Administration, and assisted in the adoption of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Paul and the NWP also played a role in getting language protecting women included in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nAlice Paul and the NWP did not limit their fight for women's rights to domestic arenas but also became active in international feminism as early as the 1920s. Among other actions, in 1938 Paul formed the World Woman's Party, which served as the NWP's international organization. It first assisted Jewish women fleeing the Holocaust and then became the NWP's office for promoting equal rights for women around the world. The NWP helped both Puerto Rican and Cuban women in seeking the vote, and in 1945 advocated successfully for the incorporation of language on women's equality in the United Nations Charter and for the establishment of a permanent United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.\nThe political strategies and tactics of Alice Paul and the NWP became a blueprint for civil rights organizations and activities throughout the 20th century. In 1997, the NWP ceased to be a lobbying organization and became a non-profit, educational organization. Today, the House tells the story of a century of courageous activism by American women.\nWhereas, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the \"Antiquities Act\"), authorizes the President, in the President's discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;\nWhereas, in 1974, the Secretary of the Interior designated the Sewall-Belmont House a National Historic Landmark for its association with Alice Paul, the NWP, and the fight for equal rights, and later the same year the Congress enacted legislation creating the Sewall-Belmont House National Historic Site, an affiliated area of the National Park System;\nWhereas, the National Park Service completed a study in November 2014, which recommended that the Sewall-Belmont House become a unit of the National Park System and operate through cooperative management between the National Park Service and the NWP;\nWhereas, for the purpose of establishing a national monument to be administered by the National Park Service, the NWP has donated to the Federal Government fee title to the Sewall-Belmont House and the approximately 0.34 acres of land on which it is located;\nWhereas, the National Park Service and the NWP agree that the NWP should continue to own and manage its collection, which includes an extensive library and archival and museum holdings relating to the women's movement, and the NWP has indicated its intention to enter into appropriate arrangements with the National Park Service that would further the preservation of the permanent collection at the Sewall-Belmont House and provide for cooperative interpretation and management activities with the National Park Service;\nWhereas, it is in the public interest to preserve and protect the Sewall-Belmont House and the historic objects associated with it;\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as a part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation. The reserved Federal lands and interests in lands encompass approximately 0.34\nacres. The boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\nAll Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries described on the accompanying map are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, or other disposition under the public land laws, from location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing.\nThe establishment of the monument is subject to valid existing rights.\nThe Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall manage the monument through the National Park Service, pursuant to applicable legal authorities, consistent with the purposes and provisions of this proclamation. The Secretary shall prepare a management plan, with full public involvement and in coordination with the NWP, within 3 years of the date of this proclamation. The management plan shall ensure that the monument fulfills the following purposes for the benefit of present and future generations: (1) to preserve and protect the objects of historic interest associated with the monument, and (2) to interpret the monument's objects, resources, and values related to the women's rights movement. The management plan shall, among other things, set forth the desired relationship of the monument to other related resources, programs, and organizations, both within and outside the National Park System.\nThe National Park Service is directed to use applicable authorities to seek to enter into agreements with others, and the NWP in particular, to address common interests and promote management efficiencies, including provision of visitor services, interpretation and education, establishment and care of museum collections, and preservation of historic objects.\nNothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the monument shall be the dominant reservation.\nWarning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure, destroy, or remove any feature of this monument and not to locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-12", "title": "Proclamation 9423—Establishment of the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117058", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:20 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody.\nQ: Hello!\nQ: Good afternoon!\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you for the vigorous and warm welcome. (Laughter.) I don't have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to questions, Darlene.\nQ: Okay, thanks. A couple of questions to follow up on Zika from earlier this week. You've been pretty critical of Congress over that issue for not acting on the President's funding request.\nMR. EARNEST: That's a fair assessment.\nQ: Yesterday, the House passed a Senate bill that's supposed to speed up vaccines and treatments for diseases including Zika, and I wondered if you might be willing -- or give you an opportunity to walk back a little bit of your criticism of Congress on that issue since they have passed this bill and it's now coming to the President's desk.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Darlene, I hate to disappoint members of Congress, but the passage of that bill that you described is positive but a rather meager accomplishment. We were talking about earlier, in some ways it's akin to passing out umbrellas in the advance of a potential hurricane. So an umbrella might come in handy, but it's going to be insufficient to ensure that communities all across the country are protected from a potentially significant impact. That's what we're focused on.\nDarlene, you may be familiar with the expression of being a day late and a dollar short.\nQ: I am.\nMR. EARNEST: In this case, Congress is two months late and $1.9 billion short in providing the assistance that our public health professionals say that they need to make sure that they respond appropriately to this situation. The bill that Congress passed yesterday doesn't include any funding. So that's not going to do anything to help local communities across the country that carry this virus -- or fight the mosquitoes that carry this virus. It's not going to expand access to diagnostics that would allow people to more easily get tested and get a prompt result from that test about whether or not they have the Zika virus.\nAll of these are steps that are critical to ensuring that we're protecting pregnant women and their newborn children from a virus that we know has a potentially devastating impact.\nSo, no, I'm not prepared to give Congress credit for that legislation. It is a positive step, but it is a far cry from what our public health experts tell us is necessary to prepare for the situation.\nQ: But developing a Zika vaccine is one of the things the administration wants to happen, and this bill is supposed to help speed that process along. So --\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'm not criticizing the legislation that they have passed. But there's far more significant steps that they could take even as it relates to expediting the production of a vaccine. One of the things that we know that the private sector does is they make decisions based on a commitment from the federal government to be a customer. That's why even private sector entities that we want to partner with to develop and test and eventually manufacture these vaccines are looking for a serious commitment. And we're talking about a serious virus. And I don't understand why Congress has failed to make the serious commitment that our public health professionals indicate they need.\nDr. Fauci, the Director of the NIH, stood at this podium two days ago and said that he does not have what he needs right now in order to do all that is necessary to prepare for this virus. And this is a unique scenario. We have advance warning. And for the last two months, Congress has frittered away the opportunity to ensure that we're doing all that we possibly can to protect the American people from a virus that, for most people, is not dangerous, but for pregnant women and newborn children could be incredibly dangerous. And that's why the President is seeking to work with Congress in bipartisan fashion to protect the country.\nQ: Will he sign the bill?\nMR. EARNEST: I would anticipate that the President will sign the bill. Again, having an umbrella in a hurricane may in some situations come in handy, but it is insufficient to ensuring that our country is prepared for a situation that could have a significant impact.\nQ: The Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee today said that they're inclined to give the President some of the $1.9 billion that he wants for Zika, but they may wait until September to do that. Given your comments to my earlier question, I guess that would be unacceptable.\nMR. EARNEST: It would be unacceptable. We know this is a mosquito-borne virus, and so why we would wait for all the mosquitoes to be born, to travel across the country and to spread, potentially carrying the disease before we begin to take steps to fight it doesn't make any sense. It almost makes me long for the days of having old Tom DeLay back. The former exterminator could surely offer some advice. (Laughter.) But, in this case, no professional extermination advice is required to figure out what we need to do to protect the country. But maybe we'd get -- maybe this gets Tom DeLay a couple of cable hits out of his former tenure in the United States Congress.\nQ: Okay, switching topics. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Or not. Or not.\nQ: He's got more material there. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: That's what I was going to say. We could just --\nQ: Jon Stewart back there? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: That's right. I'll be here all week.\nQ: Can you confirm reports that Russian attack planes buzzed a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Baltic Sea several times on Monday and Tuesday? And how will the U.S. respond to Russia for that activity?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, the White House is aware of the incident that you described. In the Baltic Sea earlier this week there were reports of Russian planes flying dangerously close to a U.S. Naval ship and a Polish aircraft. This incident, as you won't be surprised to hear, is entirely inconsistent with the professional norms of militaries operating in proximity to each other in international waters and international airspace. Any peacetime military activity must be consistent with international law and norms and conducted with due regard for the rights of other nations and the safety of other aircraft and other vessels.\nThere have been repeated incidents over the last year where the Russian military, including Russian military aircraft, have come close enough to each other, or have come close enough to other air and sea traffic to raise serious safety concerns. And we continue to be concerned about this behavior.\nFor more details about the specific incident and what kind of risk it may have posed to our servicemen and women, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense.\nQ: What about in terms of a response to Russia? A formal protest, or --\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously, we have a variety of channels through which we can communicate with the Russians. But I don't have any updates right now about any conversations that have occurred about this particular incident.\nTim.\nQ: The President has a meeting today in Virginia.\nMR. EARNEST: He does.\nQ: Do you expect any announcements on anything in Syria or Iraq?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, yes, the President is meeting with the senior members of his national security team at CIA Headquarters in Virginia. It will be part of the periodic set of meetings that the President has done with the senior members of his national security team to get an update -- a detailed update -- of our ongoing effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. There are a variety of aspects to that strategy, and that's why you have such a wide variety of the President's national security advisers participating in the meeting.\nYou'll have an opportunity to hear directly from the President at the conclusion of the meeting. At this point, I'm not aware of any plan to announce any major decisions that were made in the context of the meeting. But obviously all of you will have an opportunity to hear directly from the President about what he learned in the meeting and why those kinds of briefings are valuable as we continue to maximize our coordinated strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nQ: And to what extent do you expect the meeting will concentrate on Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and not other places like Europe and the Philippines?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the focus will be on our ongoing campaign against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. This is essentially the headquarters of ISIL, if you will. But we know that there are extremists in other parts of the world that have sought to establish a safe haven in other places. And we're mindful of the risk that they pose in those other places, as well. But at this point I would anticipate that the focus of the meeting will be on continuing to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.\nQ: And on the KRG, Deputy Prime Minister Talabani today was talking about the monthly deficit of $100 million and he would accept any conditions for that budget support. Is the administration open to any kind of budget support for the KRG direct?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any updates that we have on this particular situation. But if we have news to make on this, I'll circle back with you and let you know.\nQ: And Puerto Rico, on the debt relief bill. Does the White House believe that the differences in the bill can be resolved quickly? A Treasury official was up on the Hill today saying there's a lot of differences that still need to be taken.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, well, I will say that we are gratified that Congress is continuing to make some progress. And this has been -- it's been challenging to continue to nurture a bipartisan process in the House. But we've seen good-faith actors on both sides of the aisle, both at the leadership level as it relates to Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi, but also at the committee level, at the House Natural Resources Committee, try to find common ground that would offer the kind of debt-restructuring authority to the Puerto Rican government that we know that they need.\nSo we do have some technical concerns with the way that the bill is currently drafted. We're concerned with at least some aspects of it that we believe would not provide them sufficient authority to deal with the challenges that they face there.\nWe're also concerned that there are some unnecessary provisions in the bill that relate to things like federal lands and worker protections that would only worsen the economic problems that Puerto Rico faces, particularly when you consider that they've already suffered through a decade-long recession. It seems like the inclusion of those unnecessary provisions is, well, unnecessary.\nQ: And how confident are you that things can be ironed out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have been able to make important progress working in bipartisan fashion thus far. The release of a -- or at least the committee putting forward text of a bill is important progress, and we hope that we can keep the momentum going. But there's still some important work to be done here.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks. You just talked about Puerto Rico and how difficult the issue is. You definitely made it sound like the White House is confident that the House would be able to come up with a solution, and I kind of want to compare that to your statements on encryption. You just saw the Senate put out their draft bill on that. It seems like your statements so far have been less confident that a complex issue can be solved by Congress. Can you sort of square that circle for me? Why on Puerto Rico you seem to be confident, and on encryption you seem to say Congress is not going to be able to do it.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think I've said much to indicate that I am overly rosy about the prospect of important congressional action. I think we're hopeful, and we've seen some positive work done to address Puerto Rico's significant challenges. So I'd just -- while complicated, I think in some ways, the challenges facing Puerto Rico have a little more to do with the inherent political obstacles to getting this kind of legislation done. In some ways, this is sort of the classic -- this is the kind of case study I think that you could imagine undergraduate political science courses taking a close look at, right, because you obviously have a problem that is affecting 3.5 million Americans in Puerto Rico, but across the country they don't have -- there's not a clear constituency to apply pressure to members of Congress to make sure that they're doing the right thing.\nBut yet, when you consider the bondholders who are holding this debt, these are, almost by definition, rich and powerful people who have a clear financial interest in getting a deal that reflects their financial interests and not the interests of the 3.5 million people living in Puerto Rico.\nAnd overcoming that dynamic is something that will be challenging for Congress to do, and it will only be successful if we do work in bipartisan fashion to get it done. So while it's difficult, it's not particularly complicated. We do know the kind of -- in fact, the kind of restructuring authority that we want to offer to the Puerto Rican government is the same kind of authority that is available to municipalities all across the country.\nSo there's a template for addressing this problem, and it shouldn't be that hard to figure out a way to provide the necessary oversight to ensure that Puerto Rico follows through on the kinds of reform commitments that they make in the context of getting this restructuring authority. So there's a template for addressing this challenge.\nAs it relates to encryption, the politics of that situation are no less complicated, but the policy details themselves are also quite complicated, particularly when you consider that you're dealing with a policy environment that's rapidly changing. Technology is rapidly developing, and as innovations are implemented in the market, we need to have a policy that doesn't just resolve the significant political tensions, but also can be dynamic enough to anticipate and continue to apply even as the environment changes as a result of innovation.\nSo I think these are two very different challenges. I want to be clear, I'm not that rosy about Congress even confronting the easy things. Because, again, too often, things that are common sense haven't gotten done in Congress. And I think that would account for the rather low esteem in which the public holds Congress right now -- things like waiting two months to do anything to address the potential problems caused by Zika. And only then passing a piece of legislation that doesn't include any actual funding that our public health professionals say that they need I think is an indication that Congress struggles to even do the easy things.\nAnd there's no doubt that working through the situation in Puerto Rico and working through the challenges of developing a policy to deal with encryption are even more significant than that.\nQ: Has the President been briefed on the bill that is being sort of worked out in the Senate to deal with encryption? Is there going to be a White House effort to -- good faith effort to work with the Senate to actually come up with a solution, given the fact that you seem to think that the Senate is incapable of finding a solution on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, of course we're going to engage with members of Congress on this. And we will -- we've been doing that all along, and we'll continue to do that in this case. But look, the prospects of Congress actually developing and building bipartisan agreement around a good piece of legislation that appropriately balances the competing equities here, and then taking the additional step of actually getting it passed I think are somewhat low. But I'm an optimistic guy. I'm happy to be surprised.\nQ: And I got another on the issue of putting -- on making a change to the $10 bill. Would the White House or the President be supportive of Treasury Secretary Lew, if he decides to leave the $10 bill as it is and potentially changes a different -- or if the President insists that the woman be on the $10, could there be a movement to put a woman on a different bill? Does it have to be the $10 bill?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, this is obviously a decision that's made at the Treasury Department. And that's codified in the statute. But I think what Secretary Lew has said on this in the past is that he's considering changes to a number of elements of our currency. It's not just -- the consideration of changes, including ensuring that women are featured on our currency extend beyond just the $10 bill. Secretary Lew has said that in the past. But for an update in terms of where they are in that process, I'd refer you the Treasury Department.\nQ: Just one more on the refugee issue. The President is going to be going to Germany later this month, and we know that the Germans have taken in a large number of refugees. I'm wondering if the President feels that he needs to shore up Prime Minister Merkel based on what she has faced -- her poll ratings after accepting so many refugees and how the President sort of assesses his role. Since last year, he said he was going to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees. And it seems like -- I think we've only taken in less than 1,500, and we're very far into the fiscal year -- how the President assesses his administration's job on taking the refugees and fulfilling that promise that he made last year.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think as it relates to Germany, I do anticipate that the President will have an opportunity to give credit to the German people and to the German government because they've earned some credit. They have done a difficult thing, which is that they have offered refuge to hundreds of thousands of innocent people who are fleeing violence in their home countries. And that has strained not just the nation of Germany, but the entire continent. Those kinds of strains are understandable. And I think the majority of people in Germany have responded with the kind of humanity and generosity that we'd like to see. And even in the face of some political criticism, Chancellor Merkel has focused on implementing a policy that's consistent with the broad acknowledgement of human rights in the way that we observe -- what our values and morals tell us about responding to a situation like this. So she deserves credit for that and the German people deserve credit for that.\nAs it relates to the U.S. policy here, obviously the situation that the United States faces is different than the situation that the Germans are facing. And part of that is that the President has made clear that there will be a rigorous screening process that's put in place before refugees can enter the United States.\nWhat is true is that individuals who enter the United States as refugees go through more rigorous screening than anyone else who attempts to enter the United States. And that's going to take some time. I don't have an update for you in terms of hitting our goal. I'd refer you to the State Department for that. But I know this is something that the President has made a priority and he's made clear to the State Department that it's a priority. And I'm confident that it will be implemented accordingly.\nRon.\nQ: Is it true that the screening process is being expedited for a number of refugees who are coming in from Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there has been an effort to put additional resources behind this effort that could make the process move more quickly. But I'd refer you to both the State Department and DHS for an update on that.\nI am confident in telling you that in no scenario would the standards be weakened before an individual is able to enter the United States under their refugee status.\nQ: So again, the goal is still 10,000 by the fiscal year?\nMR. EARNEST: That is still the goal.\nQ: How do you think the President will explain to Mrs. Merkel about his inability to have that happen here in the United States when Germany has taken in close to I think a million people?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the President when he travels to Germany will be prepared to tell her that he's prepared to meet the goal.\nQ: That just seems like it might be a little embarrassing to not be able to get 10,000 people into your country.\nMR. EARNEST: Ron, I'm not willing to say that we're not going to hit the goal. So you should check with the State Department about that. But I don't see any indication at this point that we won't be able to make it.\nQ: On the meeting this afternoon with the national security team -- I remember at the nuclear summit a week or so ago, the President had 50 or so heads of state there. Has anything changed with the coalition since then that is reflected in operations on the ground? Or what's different since then that will perhaps be brought up at this meeting or discussed at this meeting? I'm just trying to see where there's progress or where there's change.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think one obvious area where we've made some progress just in the last couple of weeks is the announcement from Belgian authorities that they've made important progress in their ongoing investigation into the terrorist attacks that ISIL sponsored in Belgium at the end of last month.\nObviously, the United States has been strongly supportive of European law enforcement, including Belgian law enforcement, as they've conducted those investigations. There has been valuable information that we've been able to share and other technical expertise that we've been able to offer that they have found helpful.\nThere continues to be a steady effort to ramp up the pressure against ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq. I have some updated statistics here. The United States and our coalition partners have launched now more than 11,500 strikes on ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria. Thousands of ISIL fighters have been taken off the battlefield, including senior leaders and external operations plotters, like the number two figure in ISIL, Haji Mutazz; Mohammed Emwazi, who is otherwise known as \"Jihadi John;\" and Haji Iman, who was essentially the finance minister for ISIL.\nWe've also dramatically improved our intelligence-sharing with partners to better counter the external threat that is posed by ISIL emanating from Iraq and in Syria. And the other area where we've made some important progress is actually an indication of the important role that the CIA plays in all of this. You'll recall that the United States conducted a raid against a leading ISIL figure in May of last year, almost a year ago. That figure was Abu Sayyaf, who was also a senior financial planner for ISIL. That operation in one instance led to the death of a senior ISIL figure, but it also gave our intelligence operatives access to a treasure trove of information. CIA analysts and other members of our intelligence community had an opportunity to dig into that material. And because of their effective integration with our military, they've been able to undertake an operation -- a set of operations that have significantly impaired ISIL's ability to finance their operations.\nSo material that was collected from that compound allowed us to develop a detailed understanding of ISIL's illicit oil operations. And it led to something that the Department of Defense called Operation Tidal Wave II. Strikes that were carried out in the context of Operation Tidal Wave II targeted oil infrastructure supply lines and hundreds of tanker trucks that ISIL used to move oil.\nThis essentially black market for oil that ISIL capitalized on, according to some analysts, actually was responsible for financing about a half of their operations. And we've been able to deal a significant setback to their ability to sell oil on the black market. And that's had a significant impact on ISIL's ability to fund their operations.\nAnd just to give you one example, there are some key oilfields inside of Syria that at one point accounted for more than half of ISIL's monthly oil revenue. And we carried out strikes against the oilfield that has significantly impaired their ability to collect revenue from those sources.\nSo that is an example of important progress that we've made over the last several months, and I think it is a good illustration of the important role that the intelligence community has to play in our efforts against ISIL. And it's one of the reasons that the President is convening the meeting at CIA Headquarters today.\nQ: What about the problem of fragmentation where now ISIL is becoming something of a franchise operation, some people have said? Is there progress -- how has the strategy adjusted to deal with that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have seen that the threat from extremists has become more diffuse. And I know that Director Brennan talked about this a little bit earlier today with your network where he talked about the challenges that are facing the counterterrorism operation here in the United States, which is we know that extremist organizations don't have the same kind of capacity and capabilities that they used to have when you had this core of al Qaeda plotters that had a safe haven in Afghanistan that they could use to carry out attacks around the world.\nThe threat is different now, but it's still serious and one that we take quite seriously. And that is why you've seen the United States just in the last couple of months announce airstrikes, taking significant extremist leaders off the battlefield in places like Libya and Somalia. That's an indication that while we're quite focused on the threat that's emanating from Iraq and in Syria, we're mindful that there are risks in other places, and we haven't taken our eye off the ball in terms of confronting those either.\nQ: Do you think that since Brussels, or does the President think that since Brussels that the threat has been reduced?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it is hard to reach that conclusion. I think the reason for that is that what's been revealed in Belgium is that there are these networks that ISIL has been able to tap into even in the West that have the potential of carrying out terrible acts of violence. And we need to be rigorous about countering that effort. And there are a variety of ways that we need to do that -- this sort of goes to what the President was talking about in his interview with Chris Wallace over the weekend -- that it's not just important that we are focused on the campaign against ISIL to degrade and ultimately destroy that organization, but how we do it is important too.\nAnd that is going to be critical to our ability to root out and clean up networks that ISIL may be trying to establish in the West and in countries that we're quite friendly with.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Just a little housekeeping to begin with. Can you give an update on the numbers at Gitmo? And has there been any progress on transferring any of the current detainees there to other places?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any update on the numbers, but every time that there is a transfer, that is something that we make public. So you should be able to get an updated public assessment from the Department of Defense. And if there are any additional transfers in the weeks ahead, we'll obviously let you know.\nQ: All right, great. On the 28 pages, we talked yesterday about, in the congressional report pertaining to 9/11, there was a report later in the evening from the Tampa Bay Times that former Florida Senator Bob Graham had been advised by the administration that sometime within the next month or two, that those 28 pages may become declassified. Can you confirm that?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't confirm the timeline. Obviously, Senator Graham dedicated a significant portion of his career to being the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the United States Senate, so he's somebody who has his own experience and even expertise on some of these issues. And we have made an effort to stay in touch with those that we know have a genuine and serious interest in these issues. So that's why he got the phone call. But I can't account for the -- or at least I can't confirm that timeframe at this point.\nObviously this is a process that's run by the Director of National Intelligence. And I'd refer you to them for an assessment of the timeframe for a decision.\nQ: Have the President and Mr. Clapper had a conversation about this?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific conversations between the two of them on this, but at the same time I couldn't rule it out. Obviously, the President consults regularly, almost daily, with his Director of National Intelligence, and for obvious reasons, those are conversations we don't talk about publicly.\nI can tell you that the Director of National Intelligence has indicated that they're hopeful that they will be able to complete the process of the review of these 28 pages before the end of President Obama's tenure in office. That's what they're aiming for. But for an update on that timeline, I'd encourage you to check with them.\nQ: I had a conversation with Jack Quinn yesterday, one of the attorneys representing thousands of the 9/11 families, and victims of 9/11. And in my conversation, he suggested that there has been sort of a back and forth between this administration and congressional lawmakers over the potential measures that might sanction governments that might have a hand in terrorism. Can you sort of help me walk through that process, what the administration viewpoint is on congressional measures that might sanction foreign governments that might have a hand in terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there obviously are a number of places where the administration has worked with Congress to put in place sanctions, and in some cases taken actions on our own to put in place sanctions against countries that sponsor terrorism. Iran is the best example. Iran is a country that is subject to sanctions by the United States that we've coordinated with the international community because we know they sponsor terrorism.\nQ: What about civil damages, though?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that would be a different question. Obviously, civil damages would be something that would go through a legal process.\nQ: Is that something the President would support?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure that the President at this point would weigh in on a hypothetical question like that that would ultimately be decided by the courts.\nPam.\nQ: Josh, Senator Leahy said that he was pessimistic now about the Garland nomination getting out of committee and that there was no procedural way that they could get it out of committee and to the floor. How do you feel about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, as I mentioned earlier, I'm an optimistic guy, and I continue to be very optimistic about the prospects for Chief Judge Garland. The reason for that is we made important progress in advancing his nomination thus far.\nYou'll recall that shortly after the announcement of Justice Scalia's untimely death, Leader McConnell made clear that the Senate would in no way consider anybody that the President put forward. But again, you have, even today, Chief Judge Garland meeting with another four or five members of the United States Senate. Just yesterday, he met with three Republican members of the United States. These are three Republican senators who -- including the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and including one senator, Pat Toomey, who had previously said that he wouldn't meet with Chief Judge Garland. But because of the pressure that he has faced to do his job, he did change his position and ultimately meet with Chief Judge Garland. They had, according to Senator Toomey's readout, a \"substantive conversation.\" I think it lasted almost an hour.\nAnd I think the question now, though, particularly for the people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is, well, now that your senator has had the opportunity to hear from Chief Judge Garland, shouldn't you get the benefit of hearing from him too? Senator Toomey said that he was prepared to ask some tough questions, and that after having that conversation with Chief Judge Garland, Senator Toomey claims to harbor some concerns.\nWell, if those concerns are genuine, why wouldn't we hear about them in public? Why would Senator Toomey just try to keep that conversation private? Why wouldn't we have a forum, like the Senate Judiciary Committee, convene a hearing? And let's have Chief Judge Garland answer those questions on the record, on camera and under oath. He's happy to answer Senator Toomey's tough questions in that setting. And then let's do what Republicans recommend -- let's let the people have a voice. Let's them decide about whether or not this nomination should move forward.\nI suspect, Pam, that if Senator Toomey actually believed that Chief Judge Garland was -- or actually harbored legitimate concerns that Chief Judge Garland wasn't qualified for the Supreme Court, I suspect that Senator Toomey, at that point, then would support a hearing, because he would certainly be eager to demonstrate to the people of Pennsylvania why he opposed Chief Judge Garland's nomination.\nThat's why I suspect that, in fact, Senator Toomey understands that Chief Judge Garland would perform quite well in the context of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. He would do well in answering questions on the record, on camera, under oath about some of the most difficult legal questions facing this country. He would do so well, in fact, that we would see increased public pressure for the United States Senate to confirm him.\nThat is why Senator Toomey and the other Republicans in the United States Senate don't want to go through a hearing. That's why they don't want to move forward with a hearing. Because they don't want to give Chief Judge Garland the opportunity to demonstrate his fitness for the job. And that just is not -- that's not fair. It's also inconsistent with what the American people expect of the United States Senate. It's also inconsistent with the requirements of the United States Constitution.\nQ: Well, I guess the key to the next step going beyond these courtesy visits, is -- Chuck Grassley, the head of the Judiciary Committee, who says he's faced a lot worse pressure than this and he's not going to cave into it.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, with all due respect to Chairman Grassley, he's had a couple different positions about whether or not he was going to meet with Chief Judge Garland as well. And, look, I think the question for him is the same. I think that he and Senator Toomey and some of the other Republicans were hopeful that by taking the private meeting with Chief Judge Garland, that that would relieve some of the pressure that they face.\nI happen to think that the opposite is true. Now that they've had the private meeting and now that they've had the private conversation, I think it only begs the question why they won't want to have that conversation in public. And I'm not really sure what the answer to that would be unless their only concern is they don't want to have that conversation in public because they know how well Chief Judge Garland would do in answering their questions.\nThat's the reason they don't want to have it in public. That's the reason that they don't want to move forward with a hearing, because that's only going to increase the pressure on them to vote.\nSo, look, I know that there are people who are eager to say, look, you guys aren't really changing the tone, you're not changing the dynamic of the debate on Capitol Hill as it relates to Chief Judge Garland's nomination. And I think what I would say is the direction of that debate right now is such that Republicans are feeling pressure to do things they said they weren't going to do. Now, that started out as holding private meetings with Chief Judge Garland that they originally indicated they weren't prepared to have. And after having those private meetings I think the pressure is only going to continue to increase.\nQ: If Grassley sticks to his guns, is there a fallback strategy? Is there thought of a recess appointment, anything like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, there is a clearly specified process for confirming nominees to the Supreme Court. And nowhere in the Constitution does it say that the Senate should not follow that process in an election year. In fact, the last time that the Senate had to move forward through the process of voting for a nominee for the Supreme Court in a presidential election year, the members of the United States Senate actually did their job. In that situation, you had Democrats who were in charge of the Senate, and in 1988 they were actually being asked by a Republican President of the United States in his last year in office to vote to confirm Justice Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court, and they did. They followed through. They did their job. But right now, you have Republicans in the Senate who are refusing to do their job.\nAnd I know there are some who want to say, well, look, I recognize that this may be an issue of real importance in Washington, D.C., but across the country it's hard to get people particularly exercised about the Supreme Court. First of all, I'm not really sure that I agree with that sentiment that some express because I do think that people understand the consequences of ensuring that the Supreme Court is fully staffed when considering important questions like immigration reform and climate change and personal privacy and other things -- affirmative action. But what I do think people feel strongly about is that public servants, who are collecting annual six-figure paychecks, not doing their job -- that I think people are going to be pretty concerned about. And I think that is a question that people who are on the ballot in the fall are definitely going to have to reckon with.\nQ: Josh, can I follow up?\nMR. EARNEST: Sure, Suzanne. Go ahead.\nQ: You've been making this case from the podium for weeks now. I mean, at what point does the White House change its strategy? I mean, there's clearly still resistance from the Republican leadership that there are not going to be these hearings. So when do you adjust, when do you change your strategy to something that's more successful?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Suzanne, we initially encountered resistance from Republicans refusing to even meet with Chief Judge Garland. And I think by the end of this week we'll be up to eight or nine Republican senators who have agreed to meet with Chief Judge Garland. All of them are doing that over the objection of the Republican leader in the United States Senate who has said that he's not going to do any meetings, and he said that the Senate wouldn't even consider Chief Judge Garland.\nAnd I think after these meetings occur, you see them facing even more intense pressure from their constituents, saying, why are you having a long conversation with Chief Judge Garland in private but not in public? Why do you have to hide in the Senate dining room to have this conversation? Why wouldn't you have this conversation in public? What is it that you're concerned about? What are you embarrassed about? Why not just follow through with the process, the time-honored process of giving the Chief Judge the opportunity to make his case?\nAnd here's the thing. I don't think you'd actually necessarily be doing Chief Judge Garland a favor. First of all, it's the Senate's job to do this. Second of all, we would anticipate that Chief Judge Garland would face really tough questions from Democrats and Republicans. And he would face those questions for hours at a time, and he'd do it with the camera turned on all the time. And he'd do it under oath. That's a tall order. But that's exactly what the President's expectation is that Chief Judge Garland should do.\nSo we're not asking for a free pass. We are asking for members of the United States Senate -- Republicans -- to do their job.\nQ: So would you consider having Garland go before some other forum to get the message across? I mean, if you can't get the public hearings, is there some other way that he would be able to speak to the public?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, we would just prefer that the Senate follow through with their regular process. And there have been a number of senators who have now had the opportunity to -- there are now a number of senators who have had an opportunity to hear from him in private, and we believe that those senators and the rest of the American people should have the opportunity to hear from him in public.\nQ: You won't create some sort of other alternative forum to allow him to do that?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, that's not something that we're contemplating. There is a forum that has been given to every Supreme Court nominee since 1875. Every single Supreme Court nominee since 1875 has either gotten a hearing and/or a vote unless the President pulled back their nomination. And the President made pretty clear he's not going to pull back Chief Judge Garland's nomination. He is clearly worthy of a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, and he is clearly worthy of being treated fairly by the United States Senate. And that's going to require Republicans in the United States Senate doing their job, doing the job that they are paid to do.\nAnd, look, even if there may be individual voters across the country who are not following the day-to-day developments of the Supreme Court fight, I do think that they're following the day-to-day developments about whether or not their representatives in Washington are doing their job.\nQ: And on the meeting today with his National Security Council, is the message coming out of that meeting going to be focused on U.S. allies and the importance of them sharing intelligence -- doing a better job of sharing intelligence when it comes to ISIS?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the importance of sharing intelligence will certainly be a part of the conversation. I described the way that U.S. intelligence analysts were able to exploit information from the Abu Sayyaf raid to benefit our campaign. That's an indication of how important it is to closely integrate our military and intelligence activities. It's also an indication of just how important it is for intelligence analysts to be able to share information with the military, but also with other intelligence agencies, to develop a better picture of what exactly is happening on the ground in Iraq and in Syria, because that's just going to enhance our ability to further disrupt, degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nSo that's the focus of our efforts. And that will include encouraging our allies to do a better job of sharing even more information with the United States and our partners. And we're going to continue to make that case, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's something that does come up in today's meeting.\nBill.\nQ: On the Russian flyover in the Baltic, two days ago we were told that the Russians made 11 different passes at 100 feet, so close that they left wakes in the water, and that this is specifically forbidden by the joint agreement of forces operation. So isn't this something that would then rise to the level of a presidential complaint?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Bill, I think at this point I wouldn't prejudge exactly how -- we'll register our concerns in private with the Russians. Obviously --\nQ: Would it be private? Why wouldn't it be public?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the conversation that we're having now would be public. And I've made quite clear that the actions by these particular Russian military pilots were inconsistent with the professional norms of militaries that are operating in proximity to one another in international airspace and in international waters. We've made no bones about that. And my colleagues at the Defense Department have been clear about that publicly, as well.\nIn terms of what the private conversations look like, I just don't have a description of that for you right now. But we'll keep you posted on that.\nQ: But it seems to be serious enough that it would warrant presidential attention.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Bill, what's also true is that we have seen a pattern on the part of the Russians in undertaking these kinds of actions that they at least, I think, intend to be provocative. And they're a source of some irritation, and that's something that we have expressed, again, both publicly and privately to the Russians.\nBut as it relates to this specific incident, I don't know at this point exactly how to describe to you what our private communications with the Russians would be.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, The New York Times Editorial Board last week published a piece saying the U.S. military's review of the transgender military service has stalled and time has come for the ban to be lifted. Is the President satisfied by the pace at which that review is being conducted?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't gotten an update on that ongoing process, but I'd encourage you to check with the Department of Defense. Obviously, Secretary Carter has made a pretty forceful statement in terms of the kinds of values that he believes should be embodied in military policy. He does believe that people who are capable of serving their country and have a desire to do so should be allowed to do that and they shouldn't be discriminated against just because of who they are.\nBut, look, this is something that the Department of Defense is handling right now. Obviously the President approves of the value statement that we heard from Secretary Carter. But for implementing the policy, we want to make sure that we're doing that consistent with the recommendations of the military leadership. So that's why I'd refer you to Secretary Carter's office.\nQ: Yesterday you told me that a bill against transgender students in Tennessee was mean-spirited and contrary to values of equality and justice. Isn't it contradictory to hold that position and to also -- while the administration has a policy in place that prohibits transgender people from serving in the armed forces?\nMR. EARNEST: Chris, I guess I'd point out that's why we're looking to change it. And that's why Secretary Carter indicated that they're looking to changing it. So for where that process stands, I'd encourage you to check with him.\nQ: But the buck stops with the President. Is he expected to ban this by the end of his term?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know what their timeline is, but you should check with them.\nDavid.\nQ: Josh, yesterday we talked a little bit about sort of the anxiety on the campaign trail over the trade deal and what has been reflected by the candidates' position on TPP says something about sort of the public anxiety on that issue. You seemed to acknowledge the public has an anxiety on that. I'm wondering, on immigration, if what's happening on the Republican side has reflected something that is sort of counter to what people thought after 2012, which is that the country is ready for some grand piece of comprehensive reform. And you've had a legislative effort that's been blocked in Congress and an executive action that has been blocked by federal judges on two levels now. Does the White House believe there's maybe not enough public -- ultimately public support for this kind of maneuver at this point, and that's why you've had such difficulty moving forward at pretty much all levels?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think that. I think that there is demonstrated bipartisan support across the country for common-sense immigration reform that includes an important investment in border security. People often forget that the compromise legislation that was reached and passed through the United States Senate in bipartisan fashion, but was blocked by Republicans in the House, actually included an historic investment in border security.\nWhat I think in general has happened is -- and not for the first time -- that a common-sense, bipartisan piece of legislation was blocked by Republicans in charge of the House who are appealing politically to a small minority of the population. That's what's happened. And that is what leaves Republicans in Washington quite concerned about the state of their party. Because right now they see a presidential candidate -- more than one, I should say -- right now the party is fielding a series of presidential candidates that appears to be taking a page from that playbook.\nQ: But the fact that those candidates have been successful, doesn't that say something about the public's view -- not all the public, but a significant portion of it, as the President keeps trying to move forward even on his own on some of these actions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I won't deny that there are some candidates who have obviously demonstrated some success in appealing to a vocal minority. Whether or not that is a viable winning strategy in a general election remains to be seen. I think there are many Republicans -- based solely on what they've said publicly -- who are worried that it's not.\nQ: Do you feel that the anxiety that's felt by those supporting those candidates that we're talking about on the Republican side is reflective of anxiety on economics and things that -- worried that immigrants and illegal immigrants will take their jobs, or worried about the economy -- that there's deeper anxiety there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has acknowledged this anxiety. The President has described this as the aftershocks of the Great Recession. And I think the President has made it a conscious choice to make a different kind of appeal. We've seen a lot of Republicans, particularly Republicans in Congress, who have made a specific effort to exploit those fears. And, look, that proved to be an effective strategy for them in the 2014 midterm elections. But it's not good for the country, and it does have the effect of blocking common-sense policies that a majority of the country clearly supports.\nThere's a reason that you had Republican-leaning business organizations, law enforcement organizations, faith-based organizations all indicating their strong support for common-sense immigration reform.\nQ: The House is appealing to a small portion of the electorate maybe against their own party's fortunes -- I mean, how would you describe then the sort of antipathy among these federal judges that have ruled against the President's actions? I mean, you can't blame that on House lawmakers.\nMR. EARNEST: Because this is a case that is currently being appealed, I feel a little limited in what I can say about it, other than to voice confidence in the strength of the legal argument the Department of Justice will be presenting to the Supreme Court. We believe we have a strong case that is rooted in the way that previous Presidents, including Republican Presidents, have used their executive action to implement immigration policy. Both President Reagan and President George H.W. Bush, through their executive action, took action to grant some relief to hundreds of thousands of otherwise undocumented immigrants in the United States.\nI recognize that there are specific legal arguments to make. But when you just consider the policies advanced by those two Republican Presidents, I think we've got a strong argument to make when we say that what President Obama did is entirely consistent with the way that they used their executive authority. And they did it for many of the same reasons that President Obama did. They recognized that there are limited enforcement resources. They recognized that it would be good for the broader economy. They recognized that it would be good for reducing the deficit. That's all true of the steps that President Obama has sought to take here.\nSo we are prepared to make a strong case, both on the political merits but also on the legal merits, that what President Obama is seeking to do to reform our broken immigration system and to bring much needed accountability to our immigration system is actually good for the country. And that's an argument I suspect we'll have multiple opportunities to make not just before the Supreme Court, but potentially over the course of the election as we're debating all these policies.\nAlex.\nQ: Tens of thousands of Verizon workers are going on strike today. And Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders have both come down on the side of the protesters. Does the White House have any plans to reach out to either side in this or get involved?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, I'm not aware of any plan on the part of the administration to intervene in this labor dispute between Verizon and their union workers. Obviously the President has been an outspoken advocate of ensuring that people are fairly compensated for a hard day's work. But I'm not aware of any intent that we have at this point to wade into that dispute.\nQ: President Obama has been in contact with several Republican senators regarding Chief Judge Garland. Does he have any plans to reach out to anybody on the other side of the aisle regarding Zika funding?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any specific conversations that the President has. I know that he's already had some conversations with Republicans about this priority. And, look, there should be no doubt about what the administration is asking for. We sent a letter -- this is our legislative language here -- dated February 22, 2016, and it includes the actual text of the legislation that's required for Congress to act.\nSo we're certainly prepared to have conversations as necessary to get Congress to act. I would anticipate that people like Dr. Fauci from the National Institute of Health, and Dr. Schuchat from the Centers for Disease Control would be happy to have conversations with individual members of Congress to help them understand why this funding is critical to our ability to protect the country. So we're prepared to have as many conversations as necessary, but every day that goes by is a day that's wasted to prepare for the potential impact of this virus.\nLook, it's a rather unique situation. We know in advance that this is a threat. We know in advance the risk that this poses to the American population. And we've known this since early this year. The President convened a meeting in January with his national security and his public health team to discuss these risks, and in the space of a couple of weeks put together a robust proposal with specific language that Congress just needs to pass.\nBut for the last two months, we haven't seen Congress do anything other than the equivalent of start handing out umbrellas in advance of the hurricane.\nJohn.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back to Judge Garland. Earlier, in response to Pam's questions about Judge Garland and the nomination, you spoke of important progress in the nomination. I realize you're an optimist, but realistically, as it relates to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Republicans on that committee, they remain united in denying Judge Garland a confirmation hearing. Between now and Election Day, what do you see changing that dynamic -- that specific dynamic, in which Republicans on the Judiciary Committee say, we're not going to give him a confirmation hearing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that there are individual members of the committee who have agreed to meet privately with Chief Judge Garland. And again, at the conclusion of those meetings, I think it is only going to ramp up pressure on them to answer a pretty basic question, which is, now that you've been able to hear from him in private, why wouldn't you hear from him in public? And I don't really understand what the answer to that question would be -- unless the answer to that question is, I'm just going to follow Mitch McConnell's order and not do my job.\nI don't know that their constituents are going to have a lot of sympathy for that answer, but they can try it. But that's why I continue to be confident that we've got a strong case to make and we're going to continue to make it. And the pressure on Republicans is going to continue to increase. And I know that there are some Republicans who are hoping that by agreeing to these meetings that they would be able to relieve that pressure, but I think they're making the wrong calculation. I think that the pressure will only intensify.\nQ: Senator Grassley, his meeting yesterday with Judge Garland -- he issued a statement after that meeting, and the statement essentially was one in which he said the meeting was one in which he explained to Judge Garland why he will not be getting a confirmation hearing. And I realize they're meeting with him, but it seems as -- just to the Judiciary Committee where all the action is taking place, where all the necessary action needs to take place to move that confirmation going forward, if they're meeting with Judge Garland just to explain to him why he's not going to get a confirmation hearing, how can you cite that as, as you call it, important progress?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would say a couple of things about it. I think it's been well documented -- well, let me say first that I'm not going to get into the details of their private conversation. I'm going to respect the desire of those Republican senators to have that private conversation. That certainly is part and parcel of the process and I'm respectful of that part of the process. The case that I'm making is that they should also have those conversations in public. And I'm not at this point going to make those conversations public for them.\nI will, however, point out that the meeting with Judge Garland lasted for well over an hour. This is the conversation between Chairman Grassley and Chief Judge Garland. I suspect that they covered more ground on a range of substantive issues beyond just what Chairman Grassley described. And that I think is an indication that it's hard for Chairman Grassley or anybody else to explain why they would have that substantive conversation with Chief Judge Garland in private but not in public.\nFor the life of me, I -- there's only one explanation, and the only explanation is that if they were to risk having that meeting in public they would risk showing the American public that Chief Judge Garland public that Chief Judge Garland is entirely deserving and entirely capable of fulfilling his duties on the Supreme Court. That's why they're resisting the meeting.\nAnd that's a tough case to make. And the reason that they're offering that resistance is simply that Mitch McConnell told them to. And again, they're welcome to make that argument. But I don't think that the people across the country -- given what they say in polls about the Republican leadership in the United States Senate -- is going to think that that's a particularly persuasive explanation.\nQ: Just one last one on this. Do you think, or does the President think that the dynamic changes for Judge Garland if the Democratic nominee -- whoever that is, whether it's Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders -- wins in November? Does it change in a positive way for Judge Garland, that it's more likely at that point that he will get a confirmation hearing and will get an up or down vote in the United States Senate?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's hard to say, again, because I don't think that the argument that Republicans are making right now is particularly persuasive and I don't think it's going to be any more or less persuasive after Election Day.\nJulie, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Josh, some campaign finance activists have been arrested in civil disobedience actions this week, calling for more work on the part of Congress and the White House to get at some of the dark money that's sloshing around the campaign system. Given the President's promise in the State of the Union address to try to fix our politics, has he made any progress in reviewing this executive order that he's been considering for a while now on federal contractors and disclosing their campaign contributions, or any other measures that he thinks are needed to get at this problem? Because we are, as you know, in the middle of a campaign season, so if he intended to do anything, now would probably be the time.\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, this is something you've heard the President talk about quite a bit since the State of the Union, including in his speech at Springfield and in some of other public events that he's done. I know that there's been a lot of talk and a lot of news coverage about a potential executive order. I don't really have an update on that process, or whether or not even that process is ongoing.\nWhat I can say is the President has observed on a number of occasions that the most impactful way and the only real way that Congress -- or that we'll see the kind of change in our campaign finance system that we'd like to see is probably through a constitutional amendment; that given the rulings that we've seen from the Supreme Court and barring a change in those rulings, it's difficult to imagine the President doing anything with his executive authority that would have a dramatic impact on the situation.\nI think the President has said that while the problem of dark money in our politics is not insignificant, there is more that we could do to combat it than just trying to pass a constitutional amendment. For example, the President has often observed that in the midterm elections in 2014, voter turnout was somewhere around 40 percent. And a much higher turnout would have changed the outcome of the election and would have had the effect of countering so much of the dark money that spilled into our election system in the last election.\nSo what continues to be true in our country is that we have a system that is structured to give the American people the ultimate power of deciding who will lead their government. And there is an aggressive effort by special interests -- some of whom don't disclose their efforts -- to try to influence the decision-making. But ultimately it is the American people that have the power. But the ability of the American people to wield that power is dependent on their willingness to show up at the polls on Election Day. That's the ultimate factor.\nAnd I think you'll hear the President continue to make a strong case about how important it is for people to engage in a civic debate about our country, how important it is for people to be educated on the issues, how important it is for people to register to vote, and how important it is for people to actually ensure that they show up and cast a vote.\nAnd the President has made that case in a number of settings including describing the position of citizen as the most important office in our government. And the President will continue to make a forceful case in that direction.\nQ: But he also has a particularly important role in our political system.\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: Does he believe he's done everything he can do on this issue using his own authority?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has certainly been a vocal advocate of the DISCLOSE Act, which would have some impact of bringing greater transparency to our campaign finance system. The President has certainly advocated -- in some cases, famously, in front of members of the Supreme Court -- for a legal system that is structured to protect the ability of American citizens to make the most important decisions about our government.\nBut there are limitations to how much the use of his executive authority can impact this situation. There is no denying that. But there is -- the President does have the effect when he speaks publicly of motivating people or stirring people to action, of inspiring them to be involved and get engaged. And the truth is the President makes this case not just to Democrats, he does to every American.\nThe President has talked a lot about how he would love to see a more engaged, a more effective Republican Party who is actually committed to governing the country. And that's only going to happen when Republicans start showing up at the polls in greater numbers, too, when people who care about the direction not just of the United States but also the direction of the Republican Party start making their voices heard. So this isn't a particularly partisan case that the President is making. It's a case that's rooted in the belief that when the American people engage in our democracy at higher rates that our democracy functions better. And that's an argument that I anticipate will be made frequently between now and Election Day.\nQ: May I ask a follow-up question on that, Josh?\nMR. EARNEST: Go ahead, John.\nQ: Okay, thank you very much for that. There is a new group out, Take Back Our Republic, I think is the name. And they agree basically with the President on the dark money. And they have said that a good step toward eliminating it and greater participation is revival of the tax credit for campaign donations. Is that something the President would favor? This group believes it would get more people engaged when they're able to deduct for making small donations in the hundreds and lead to a greater turnout. Has he ever discussed revival of that? It faded out in the 1980s.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, John, I have to admit I haven't heard that idea before, so I'm not aware of any serious discussions around here about it. But it's something we can take a look at.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:30 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-04-13", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Today's announcements include:\n• New Department of Education guidance to states, school districts, and other education organizations on the many ways they can use existing Federal funds to advance Pre-K-12 STEM and CS learning.\n• A $200 million investment by Oracle to support CS education for an additional 125,000 students in the United States.\n• More than 500 K-12 schools committing to expand access to CS, with support from Code.org.\n• Commitments to expand STEM learning for more of our youngest learners, from family engagement to innovative use of media.\n• A new online matching platform, supported by US2020, to help more STEM professionals who want to volunteer and mentor.\nToday's STEM announcements also mark progress on the President's My Brother's Keeper Initiative and the efforts of the Council on Women and Girls to build ladders of opportunity for all young people, including populations underrepresented in STEM; incorporate STEM into the Administration's push to expand high-quality early-childhood education; and advance the Climate Education and Literacy Initiative to help connect all American students and citizens with the best-available, science-based information about climate change. Full details on all of today's announcements can be found here.\nThe White House Science Fair is part of a week of Administration activities celebrating science and technology, featuring the President's participation as a guest presenter throughout this week on the Science Channel's nightly science news segment. In addition, the White House Science Fair will be immediately followed by the USA Science & Engineering Festival, the nation's largest celebration of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, with more than 350,000 students and adults expected to engage in more than 3,000 hands-on activities over 3 days. More than 70 Federal agencies will participate in the Festival.\nA Generational Call to Action\nStudents today have the potential to be one of America's greatest generations. Though each generation of Americans brings with them new ideas and energy, today, because of unprecedented access to cutting-edge physical and digital tools, online and in-person communities, and information about the grand challenges we face, American students are even better equipped to harness their passions towards developing solutions that confront our toughest challenges.\nThey can be the Mars generation, the explorers who first step foot on another planet. Their skills, perseverance, and collaboration can help seed new technologies and solutions to tackle the climate crisis. They can collaborate to harness rapid advances in information technology and nanotechnology to understand the human brain, forge new solutions to cancer, and embrace the American spirit of discovery, invention, and entrepreneurship.\nAs the President highlighted in this year's State of the Union Address, everyone in the United States can harness technology to help solve our toughest challenges. The 2016 White House Science Fair shines a spotlight on the contributions that the Nation's students are making now, and the potential they have to help make our country and our world a better place.\nThe more than 130 students at the 2016 White House Science Fair will represent more than 40 different STEM competitions and organizations. Approximately 40 student teams will have the opportunity to exhibit their projects at the White House, and the President will personally view some of these projects. Additional information on the projects, students, and competitions being recognized at the Fair can be found here.\nA Sustained Record of Accomplishment\nThis White House Science Fair is only the most recent example of President Obama's sustained and historic focus on giving every child the opportunity to excel at STEM education. In the past 7 years:\n• The Administration has secured more than $1 billion in private investment for improving STEM education as part of the President's Educate to Innovate campaign.\n• Our Nation is more than halfway towards achieving the goal the President set in 2011 of preparing 100,000 new math and science teachers by 2021.\n• Compared to when President Obama took office, 25,000 more engineers are graduating each year from American universities.\n• STEM education has been incorporated into the priorities of the Department of Education (ED)—as illustrated by the Administration's signature Race to the Top competition—and into the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act that the President signed last year.\n• This White House has announced more than 350 commitments from college and university leadership and others to provide pathways for students underrepresented in STEM to attain degrees.\n• President Obama has started traditions such as the White House Science Fair to honor young people using STEM to improve their communities and the world.\nAnd in his final budget announced in February, the President sustains this impressive track record with an investment of $3 billion for STEM-education programs, as well as a historic $4 billion proposal in support of CS education for all students.\nNew Steps Being Announced by the Administration Today\nFederal agencies are announcing new steps to empower local communities with the tools, people, and support they need to expand their STEM efforts. These include:\n• Federal guidance on advancing STEM education. Today, the Department of Education (ED) Office of STEM is releasing a Dear Colleague Letter providing guidance for states, school districts, and other education organizations on how they can use Federal funds to support innovative STEM-education strategies and ensure equitable STEM-education opportunities and outcomes for all students in the 2016-17 school year. In particular, this guidance outlines how Federal money can be used to support high-quality, hands-on active STEM learning.\n• The  Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), along with the STEM Funders Network and the Afterschool Alliance, are collaborating to support vibrant STEM ecosystems in as many as 14 communities, where local schools, out-of-school programs, business, higher education, museums and local institutions will work together to expand STEM learning opportunities for local students. To support the effort, CNCS will place up to 28 AmeriCorps VISTA members, who will be full-time staff on the ground. In addition, CNCS is expanding STEM AmeriCorps VISTA through a new partnership with the New York Academy of Sciences that will place more than 10 AmeriCorps VISTA members over the next 2 years in afterschool STEM-mentoring programs, which will serve students who reside in 60 of the poorest neighborhoods in New York City, NY, and Newark, NJ.\n• The  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in collaboration with the YMCA of the USA, will help 10 new host cities around the country expand Thingamajig, a program developed by the YMCA of Metropolitan DC. These cities will create programs, seminars, and tools that assist students in connecting STEM education with real-world problem solving skills. This partnership builds on the last 2 years of expansion across YMCA of the USA, which reaches over 100,000 youth—with a focus on low-income and underrepresented youth—in 48 states and Washington, D.C. Additionally, this year, USPTO will expand its collaboration with the JAMTECH program to more sites across the country. JAMTECH is a hands-on educational experience that gives students with little or no exposure to computer programming the opportunity to build and program their own video games over the course of a day—teaching the principles of game design, coding, and programming in a way that allows students to expand their competencies in areas such as math, physics, analysis, logic, and strategy.\n• Over 200 Federally supported citizen-science projects for students and adults are now accessible from a single place—CitizenScience.gov. The General Services Administration (GSA) is collaborating with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (WWICS), a Trust Instrumentality of the U.S. Government, to launch CitizenScience.gov, a new central hub for citizen science and crowdsourcing initiatives in the public sector. CitizenScience.gov will provide information, resources, and tools for government personnel, students, and adults who are actively engaged in or looking to participate in citizen science and crowdsourcing projects. The development of this catalogue follows the September 2015 memorandum to Federal departments and agencies issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).\n• ED, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Too Small to Fail (TSTF) are releasing a series of tip sheets entitled \"Let's Talk, Read and Sing about STEM!\" These tip sheets provide concrete resources and recommendations for families, caregivers, and educators of infants, toddlers, and preschoolers on easy ways to incorporate STEM concepts and vocabulary into everyday routines, and suggestions for activities to engage young children in STEM learning. These new resources build on an existing suite of materials co-created by ED, HHS, and TSTF focused on early brain and language development.\n• The  National Science Foundation (NSF) will celebrate a Day of Active Learning. A robust foundation of evidence shows that while active engagement enhances learning for students of all demographics, it has an especially beneficial effect on women and underrepresented students, likely due to a greater sense of belonging that can be achieved in active classrooms. Today, NSF is announcing that it will hold an Active Learning Day later this year, with the goal of empowering and encouraging educators nationwide to use active learning in their classrooms.\nPrivate-Sector Commitments in Response to the President's Call to Action\nToday, more than 100 different organizations are announcing new commitments, showcasing the strong response to the President's State of the Union call to give every child the opportunity to learn CS, as well as his overall \"Educate to Innovate\" campaign to ensure all students have the tools to be innovators and problem-solvers. These announcements include:\n• New partnerships to train teachers and help more than 500 K-12 schools expand access to CS. Code.org has established partnerships with seven local organizations to deliver professional-learning programs aimed at preparing up to 550 new high-school and middle-school CS teachers over the next 2 years. In addition, Code.org will help support more than 500 K-12 schools expand their CS offerings. This includes:\no Nine school districts surrounding Chicago have grouped together to begin offering AP CS Principles in 21 high schools.\no Dallas Independent School District will be offering beginning CS courses districtwide for the first time in the majority of their high schools and all of their middle schools in the 2016-17 school year.\no Georgia's Department of Education and Governor's Office of Student Achievement committed to expand AP CS Principles to 60 high schools and integrate CS into preexisting courses at 60 middle schools across the state.\no Mississippi's Department of Education will host 6 summer workshops this year to prepare approximately 170 new CS teachers in grades K-5.\no Northeast Florida School Districts, representing Clay, Duval, Nassau, and St. Johns Counties, have combined efforts to spread opportunities for CS instruction to over 200,000 students served collectively by their 330 schools.\no In Washington State, Educational Service Districts 123, 171, and 112 (serving 82 school districts) have partnered with Code.org to bring CS professional-learning opportunities for elementary- and middle-school teachers as well as for middle-and high-school counselors and administrators.\n• A $200 million investment from Oracle over the next 18 months in direct and in-kind funds to support CS education in the United States. The investment will allow an additional 125,000 K-12 students to learn CS through the free Oracle Academy program. Oracle is also expanding access to emerging CS fields for interested teachers and students, through opportunities such as their free Big Data Science Boot Camps. To complement its direct CS offerings, Oracle will invest more than $3 million in nonprofit organizations focused on inspiring young girls and engaging other underrepresented students in pursuing STEM and CS degrees.\n• A new online matching platform, created by US2020, to connect more STEM professionals to volunteer opportunities, setting an initial goal to serve 20,000 students this year. The new platform will enable any nonprofit organization or classroom teacher to connect easily with a STEM professional. In 2016, US2020 will use the platform as a central hub to engage more than 1,000 corporations and civic organizations and serve more than 20,000 students with a focus on girls, traditionally underrepresented minority students, and children from low-income families.\n• Commitments to expand STEM learning for young learners nationwide. In response to the Administration's broader push to expand early-childhood education, private-sector organizations are stepping up and making new commitments to build statewide early STEM programs, equip every Head Start center across the country with STEM tools, and engage families with new media and cultural options. A full list of new commitments will be released as a part of a White House event on early learning and STEM later this month. These include:\no 100Kin10 is awarding $1.7 million to partners in New York State and has leveraged additional support from Motorola Solutions to develop ways to increase the reach and quality of engineering and CS teaching in Pre-K-12 schools.\no Common Sense Education will produce a set of early STEM-education resources and tools, covering themes like Coding for Early Readers. These resources have the potential to reach more than 300,000 teachers in 100,000 schools, and 65 million households across the country.\no The  Heising-Simons Foundation will partner with The Fred Rogers Company to support the production of 25 episodes of \"Odd Squad,\" a math-focused television show airing on PBS Kids, create games and an app, and hold free week-long summer math camps in 14 U.S. cities serving more than 400 children.\no The Hispanic Information and Telecommunications Network (HITN) will donate 10,000 STEM-focused Spanish/English Family Kits to informal learning settings (libraries and museums), community-based organizations, and national organizations—including home visitation programs—that serve low-income families in order to help expand young children's access to STEM at home.\no Learning Point Alaska, Inc. is partnering with multiple Alaska Native organizations to deliver informal, technology-based STEM programming to elementary-school students and build capacity for local teachers in Native Villages throughout Alaska.\no The  Museum of Science, Boston is launching a 3-year initiative to create a research-based Pre-K-Kindergarten engineering curriculum, which will build on the museum's Engineering is Elementary curriculum, for schools to use to teach children ages 3-5.\no The  National Head Start Association and Lakeshore Learning will set a goal to reach the one million children who are enrolled in Head Start programs with their \"Recycle Your Way to STEAM\" program.\no Sesame Workshop, the creators of Sesame Street, will develop \"Make Believe with Math,\" a research-based Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for educators, which, along with other training resources, will be made freely available online.\nFull details on all of today's announcements can be found here.", "timestamp": "2016-04-13", "title": "Fact Sheet: At White House Science Fair, President Obama Calls on this Generation of Students to Tackle the Grand Challenges of Our Time"}

{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120895", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: Well, good morning, everyone. Hi. (Applause.) This is an impressive group. Well, good morning, everyone. It is truly a pleasure and an honor to be here today. And thank you so much for having me.\nI want to start, of course, by thanking President Kim for that very kind introduction, but, more importantly, for his tremendous leadership and service here at the World Bank. I also want to recognize our outstanding Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew. And we're thrilled that he could be with us today. Thank you, Jack. (Applause.)\nAnd of course, I want to thank all of you for joining us as we celebrate this extraordinary investment by the World Bank in young women across the globe. Let's just take a moment: $2.5 billion in support of adolescent girls' education over the next five years. That is truly amazing. (Applause.)\nAnd this isn't just a breathtaking investment of resources, it's also a powerful statement of mission. It's an expression of our belief in the power of education to transform the lives and prospects of millions of girls worldwide, as well as the prospects of their families, their communities, and, of course, their countries. And it's also an affirmation of these girls' extraordinary promise.\nSo today, I want to honor President Kim and everyone at the World Bank for their vision and their leadership in making this investment possible. Absolutely. (Applause.)\nBut of course, I think we can all agree that while today's announcement is tremendously exciting and has the potential to be truly transformational, it's also, in many ways, obvious -- right, ladies? It's obvious. Because, as President Kim noted, the research on the value of girls' education is overwhelming and irrefutable. Countless studies show that when girls are educated, they earn higher salaries -- up to 20 percent more for each additional year of schooling. They raise healthier families, with lower infant mortality rates, higher vaccination rates. And by contributing more to the labor market, they can even boost their entire countries' economies.\nSo the evidence is quite compelling. When we invest in girls' education, when we embrace women in our workforce, that just doesn't benefit them, it benefits all of us. And I know this not just from research on other countries, but from the experience of my own country.\nHere in the United States, in my lifetime -- and I am not that old -- (laughter) -- it used to be perfectly legal for employers to discriminate against women in hiring. Back when I was young, girls were often discouraged from studying subjects like math and science. They were discouraged from pursuing professions like law, business or medicine. But because brave women -- and men -- fought hard to change laws and attitudes, today, nearly 60 percent of American university students are women. (Applause.)\nAnd while we still have a long way to go to ensure that women are paid fairly for their work, and can balance the needs of their families with the demands of their jobs, women now make up nearly half of the American workforce. And since 1970, women's increased labor force participation and hours' work have accounted for $2 trillion in economic growth in this country -- that's trillion with a \"t.\" (Applause.)\nSo the bottom line here is very simple: If we're looking to promote development, then we need to educate and empower women. In fact, no matter what challenge we seek to address -- from eliminating hunger to eradicating disease to confronting climate change -- girls' education will be vital for our success. Because in any country, if half the population cannot read, write or count; if half the population can't lift themselves or their families out of poverty; if half the population is devalued, abused and oppressed -- it won't matter how many water systems we build or how many agricultural or entrepreneurship programs we start. If half the population is unable to contribute fully to their society, then meaningful, sustainable development simply will not be possible. (Applause.)\nSo the data on the power of girls' education is very clear. So in light of this indisputable truth, we have to ask ourselves, well, why in so many places do we still see such glaring disparities between the education of our boys and girls, particularly when it comes to adolescent girls? And why in so many places is closing those gaps still not one of the most urgent priorities?\nI think these questions actually lead to another set of more disturbing questions: Why do girls in countless communities still face the daily threat of sexual assault simply by walking to school? Why do some people still believe that a girl who was raped was asking for it, or somehow damaged goods? Why are girls in some parts of the world still missing school because of their menstrual cycles, or made to feel that a woman's menstruation and sexuality are unacceptable?\nWhy do we still too often value girls simply for their bodies instead of their minds? (Applause.) Why in many places is it still a better investment for families to marry off their teenage daughters rather than sending them to school? And finally, why would grown men storm a school bus, shoot a 15-year-old girl in the head just for speaking about girls' education? Why, two years ago, would terrorists be so threatened by the prospect of girls going to school that they would break into a dormitory in the middle of the night and kidnap nearly 200 young girls?\nI think we can all agree that the answers to these questions aren't just about resources. Because our global failure to educate adolescent girls isn't just about whether we have adequate funding or sufficient infrastructure. It's also about whether we truly believe that girls are worth educating in the first place. And that's where this issue becomes personal for me.\nAs both a woman and as a mother of two beautiful daughters -- because when I travel the world and I meet girls who are so bright, and so hungry to go to school, I see myself in these girls. I see my daughters in these girls. And none of us -- none of us -- not a single person in this room would ever dream of not educating our own daughters. None of us would dream of consigning our girls to a life of poverty, illiteracy or abuse. So why would we accept this fate for any girl on this planet? Why? (Applause.)\nUltimately, I think that how vigorously we address the issue of girls' education worldwide speaks to whether we truly value women at all, and whether we have the moral vision to look into the eyes of any one of those girls who are not in school and see our own child. Because make no mistake about it, these girls are our girls -- every last one of them. These girls are our responsibility.\nAnd that's why, as President Kim said, last year, President Obama and I launched an initiative that we've called Let Girls Learn. Because we want to help adolescent girls worldwide get the quality education they need to fulfill their potential. And -- yes. (Applause.)\nAnd the wonderful thing is that there are so many of you already leading the way on girls' education in your own countries -- building schools, training teachers; taking on issues like forced child marriage, female genital cutting and mutilation, and domestic violence. And you're getting real, measurable results every single day.\nBut we need to expand these efforts in countries across the globe. We need every single one of you to ask yourselves, what can my government or my business or my organization do to help girls go to school? Because the truth is, this investment by the World Bank can only have its intended impact if leaders like you push girls' education to the top of your agenda -- to the very top.\nSo we need you to take advantage of this funding. We need you to work with the Bank to develop programs that will meet the needs of girls in your countries. And if your country has already reached gender parity in education, then we need you to step up and support countries where disparities still exist.\nAnd I am thrilled that countries like Ghana and India and Rwanda are already doing such important work as part of this effort -- from scholarships and mentorship opportunities, to innovative programs to break down the cultural barriers that keep girls out of school.\nSee, when leaders like all of you make investments like these, your efforts will trickle down. Because you serve as powerful examples for officials in cities and provinces and villages in your countries, and when your communities see you prioritizing this issue, it becomes politically, economically and morally easier for them to do the same.\nSo I hope you will be part of this movement. Because so many girls are counting on you -- girls who are willing to wake up before dawn, walk hours each day to school. Girls who will study for hours each night. Girls who will use the education you give them to develop their potential, provide for their families, lift up your countries.\nI could give countless examples to illustrate these points, but today, I will end with just one -- the story of a young woman named Faith, from Kenya. After watching so many of her sisters and friends undergo genital mutilation and be married off as teenagers, Faith ran away from home, determined to avoid that fate for herself. She managed to complete primary and secondary school, the only girl in her village to do so. And with the help of a USAID program called the Global Give Back Circle, Faith is now attending a technical training institute where she's studying community health and community development. On the weekends, Faith volunteers at a local hospital. And once she gets her diploma, she hopes to attend university, because, as she puts it -- and these are her words -- Faith says, \"I hope to proceed with my studies to degree level so as to encourage other girls in my community that it is possible for a lady to be educated.\" (Applause.)\nSo that's just one example, one small example. That's how Faith will be using her education. Like so many, she will be reaching back and inspiring others to follow in her footsteps. That is the kind of return on investment that we get when we educate our girls.\nSo I hope that with the support of this extraordinary commitment from the World Bank, it is now your turn to do everything in your power to educate every child on this planet. I hope you will do everything you can to develop their talent and embrace their contributions to achieve the sustainable growth and development that we all seek. Because if we do, if we work together on this, I am confident that we can give all of our children, boys and girls, a future worthy of their promise and their dreams.\nSo congratulations again. I am so excited about this investment. I look forward to working with you in the years and decades to come. So let's get to work.\nThank you all. Congratulations.

In his remarks, he referred to Emily Bergenroth, Alicia Cutter, Karissa Cheng, Addy Oneal, and Emery Dodson, members, Daisy Girl Scout Troop 411 in Tulsa ,  OK; Maya Varma, student, Presentation High School in San Jose, CA; Jacob Leggette, student, Digital Harbor Foundation's Mini Makers program; Anarudh Ganesan, student, Clarksburg High School in Clarksburg, MD; and Olivia Hallisey, student, Greenwich High School in Greenwich, CT.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117116", "text": "The President. Hello, hello, hello! Hey! Good to see you. All right, everybody, have a seat, have a seat.\nWell, hello, everybody. Welcome to the White House. There are a lot of good things about being President. I get a chance to travel all across the country and meet people and see all the amazing things that are being done; being Commander in Chief of the greatest military the world has ever known and seeing the incredible service of our men and women in uniform. Air Force One is very cool. [Laughter] I don't have to take off my shoes before I get on an airplane. [Laughter]\nBut some of the best moments that I've had as President have involved science and our annual Science Fair. I mean, I have shot a marshmallow out of a cannon directly under Lincoln's portrait. [Laughter] I have learned about prototypes from 6-year-old Girl Scouts who built a page-turning machine out of Legos for people who might be disabled—there they are. [Laughter] Good to see you guys. [Laughter] I should add, by the way, that I took a picture with them with one of their tiaras on, which I think is still floating around the Internet. [Laughter]\nMost importantly, I've just been able to see the unbelievable ingenuity and passion and curiosity and brain power of America's next generation and all the cool things that they do. I've also, by the way, had a chance to see an alarming number of robots. [Laughter] None have caused me any harm up until now. They've startled me a little bit. I understand today that we have a live chicken here, which I'm sure the White House staff is thrilled about. [Laughter] But this is fun. More importantly, it speaks to what makes America the greatest country on Earth.\nI want to publicly thank some of the people who helped make today possible, also because I want you to know who to blame if something explodes. [Laughter] We've got some Members of Congress in the house who have been highly supportive of all our science and basic research efforts. We've got my science adviser, John Holdren, who is here. Give John a big round of applause. We've got my Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith in the house.\nWe have some guests who are really helping to lift up the importance of science, like—this is not a typical combination—supermodel and supercoder Karlie Kloss is here. We've got actress and science enthusiast Yara Shahidi. Where's—there she is. Good to see you. We've got XKCD comic creator Randall Munroe is here. Give him a big round of applause. We're joined by some of the past participants of our Science Fairs, including Elana Simon, who studied her own cancer and started coming up with some cures. I remember meeting you last year. How is Harvard going?\nHarvard University student Elana Simon. It's good.\nThe President. So far, so good? She was a senior last year, just started.\nSo this is an eclectic and diverse bunch. But what they all share is this love of science and love of technology and a belief that our youngest innovators can change the world. And there's nothing that makes me more hopeful about the future than seeing young people like the ones who are here. And they come from all over the country; they come in all shapes and sizes. All of you are showing the rest of us that it's never too early in life to make a difference. You teach us about the power of reason and logic and trying things and figuring out whether they work and, if they don't, learning from that and trying something new. And you remind us that, together, through science, we can tackle some of the biggest challenges that we face.\nWhether you're fighting cancer or combating climate change, feeding the world, writing code that leads to social change, you are sharing in this essential spirit of discovery that America is built on.\nJohn Holdren helpfully reminded me that today happens to be the 273d birthday of Thomas Jefferson. [Laughter] And Thomas Jefferson was obviously a pretty good writer; the Declaration of Independence turned out pretty well. [Laughter] He was a great political thinker and a great President. But he was also a scientist. And that was true of most of our Founders. They were children of the Enlightenment. They had come of age when all the old dogmas were being challenged. And they had this incredible faith, this belief in the human mind and our ability to figure stuff out.\nAnd whether it was Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Jefferson or all the others who were involved in the founding of our country, one of the essential elements that is embedded in our Constitution and the design of this democracy is this belief that the power of the human brain when applied to the world around us can do amazing, remarkable things.\nAnd it also requires, as we're seeing from these outstanding teams, not just constant inquiry, but also strong teamwork and dogged perseverance. And by following the trail of your curiosity wherever it takes you, you are continually adding to this body of knowledge that helps make us a more secure, more prosperous, and more hopeful society. Science has always been the hallmark of American progress. It's the key to our economic success. I can't think of a more exciting time for American science than right now, because we are busy reigniting that spirit of innovation to meet so many challenges.\nJust to give you a couple examples, we're on the cusp of a new era of medicine that accounts for people's individual genes. And I've been doing a lot of work with Francis Collins, the head of NIH, around how we take the human genome that we've mapped, in part thanks to the good work of Francis and others, so that we are able to not just cure diseases generally, but figure out what exactly do you in your particular body need in order to keep it running well.\nWe're harnessing technology to develop cleaner sources of energy and save our planet in the process. We're unraveling the mysteries of the human brain, unlocking secrets of the universe. In fact, just last month, Commander Scott Kelly returned from an almost a year-long stay on the International Space Station. Some of you may have read about that. He conducted countless experiments, and he also served as an experiment himself. His identical twin brother Mark, who is an astronaut as well—Mark stayed home during this entire time that Scott was up in the air, and that meant that NASA could study the two of them side by side to gain insights into how a long-term occupation in space changes your body and your operating systems.\nIt turned out, initially, it makes you 2 inches taller. [Laughter] But I saw Mark just 2 weekends ago; apparently, you shrink back really quickly. [Laughter] It makes your head bigger too, which—[laughter]—but I don't know how big. America has also got a selfie-taking rover that's Instagramming from Mars. The International Space Station just got its first inflatable habitat for astronauts. SpaceX, on the commercial, private venture side of space, just landed a returning rocket on a drone ship in the middle of the ocean. And that's opening up the possibility of reusing our rockets instead of just throwing them away once they have launched.\nSo the progress we're seeing across the board is extraordinary, and it's just the beginning. The rest is going to be up to you, the next generation. Somewhere in your generation, maybe in this room, are pioneers who are going to be the first to set their foot on Mars—the first humans, anyway. I don't know about other life forms. [Laughter]\nAnd I know what you're capable of because I just had a chance to see some of the exhibits, and we had some of the press pool follow. If you were not blown away from some of the young people that we just had a chance to meet, then you had too big of a lunch and you were falling asleep, because if you were paying attention, it was unbelievable.\nWe've got Maya Varma, who is a senior from San Jose, California. Where is Maya? Yay, there's Maya. Maya is using a low-cost microcontroller, software freely available on the Internet, and a smartphone, and she designed a tool that allows people with asthma and other lung diseases to diagnose and monitor their own symptoms. So her goal was to use smartphone technology to make diagnostic tests for all kinds of diseases a lot cheaper. \"My aspiration is not only to create the next big thing in my field one day,\" Maya says, \"but also to make it accessible to more than a privileged few in the world.\" So give Maya a big round of applause.\nI do have to say—this is just an aside—the only problem with the Science Fair is it makes me feel a little inadequate. [Laughter] Because I think back to my high school, and first of all, I didn't have a field. Maya talked about her \"field.\" My field—I don't know exactly what my field of study was at that time, but it wasn't that. [Laughter]\nWe also have 9-year-old Jacob Leggette from Baltimore. Where is Jacob? There you go, in the bowtie. So Jacob loved programming ever since the age of 2, when he nearly wiped clean his grandma's computer—[laughter]—which I'm sure she was thrilled with. But don't worry, Jacob fixed it. Last summer, this young maker wrote to a company that manufactures 3-D printers, asked them if he could have one of the 3-D printers in exchange for feedback on whether their printers are kid friendly. So, clearly, he's a good negotiator and businessperson. [Laughter] And today, Jacob is churning out toys and games for himself and his little sister, and he dreams one day of making artificial organs for people.\nI should add, by the way, Jacob, John, had a very good idea, which is that we should have—in addition to our PCAST, which is my science advisory group, all these scientists and leaders in various fields, we should have a kid's advisory group that starts explaining to us what's interesting to them and what's working and could help us shape advances in STEM education. Anyway, that was Jacob's idea. [Laughter] So way to go, Jacob. We're going to follow up on that. Give Jacob a round of applause.\nWe have 16-year-old Anarudh Ganesan. Where is Anarudh? There he is, right there. So when Anarudh was little, his grandparents walked him 10 miles to a remote clinic in his native India for vaccinations, only to find out that the vaccines had spoiled in the heat. Though he eventually got the shots that he needed, he thought, well, this is a problem, and wanted to prevent other children from facing the same risk. So he developed what he calls the VAXXWAGON, and it's a refrigerator on wheels that transports vaccines to remote destinations. That's the kind of innovation and compassion that we're seeing from so many of these young people. So give Anarudh a big round of applause.\nAnd we have Olivia Hallisey, a high school senior from Greenwich, Connecticut. Where is Olivia? There she is. Hi, Olivia. And, now, think about this. So Olivia swept the Google Science Fair. She read about the Ebola epidemic in the news. She decides, I want to make a faster, less expensive test for the disease, as opposed to a lot of adults who were just thinking, how do I avoid getting Ebola? [Laughter] She decides, well, I'm going to fix this. So she wants a faster, less expensive test. An old test cost $1,000, took up to 12 hours to conduct. Using silk as a base instead, Olivia made the test cost $5, without requiring refrigeration, with results that are available in under 30 minutes. How about, what were you doing in high school? [Laughter] Give Olivia a big round of applause.\nSo this is just a small sample of the incredible talent that is on display at this Science Fair. And we couldn't be prouder. To all the students, to all the young people: We could not be prouder of you. I want to thank the parents and the teachers and mentors who stood behind these young people, encouraged them to pursue their dreams. I asked all the young people who I had a chance to meet, how did you get interested in this? And there were a couple whose parents were in the sciences, but for the majority of them, there was a teacher, a mentor, a program, something that just got them hooked. And it's a reminder that science is not something that is out of reach, it's not just for the few, it's for the many, as long as it's something that we're weaving into our curriculum and it's something that we're valuing as a society.\nAnd so I hope that every company and every college and every community and every parent and every teacher joins us in encouraging this next generation of students to actively engage and pursue science and push the boundaries of what's possible. We've got to give all of our young people the tools that they need to explore and discover and to dig their hands in stuff and experiment and invent and uncover something new and try things and see hypotheses or experiments fail and then learn how to extract some knowledge from things that didn't work as well as things that worked. That's another theme that came out of a lot of the conversations I had with young people.\nAnd that's why we're building on our efforts to bring hands-on computer science learning, for example, to all students. As I've said before, in the new economy, computer science isn't optional, it's a basic skill, along with the three R's. So we're issuing new guidance to school districts for how they can better support computer science education. Oracle will invest in getting 125,000 more students into computer science classes. Give Oracle a big round of applause for that. We appreciate that.\nWe've got more than 500 schools that are committing to expand access to computer science. And this is just a sample of the things that we've been putting together over the last several years to try to expand opportunity for the kind of brilliant work that's being done by these students. And we're seeing entire States take action. For example, last month, Rhode Island got on a path to bring computer science to every school within 2 years.\nSo we're going to build on this progress. We want to make sure every single one of our students—no matter where they're from, what income their parents bring in, regardless of their backgrounds—we want to make sure that they've got access to hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math education, that it's going to set them up for success and keep our Nation competitive in the 21st century. That includes, by the way, working through some of the structural biases that exist in science. Some of them, they're—a lot of them are unconscious. But the fact is, is that we've got to get more of our young women and minorities into science and technology, engineering and math, and computer science. I've been really pleased to see the number of young women who have gotten more and more involved in our Science Fairs over the course of these last several years.\nAnd as I said to a group that I had a chance to meet with outside, we're not going to succeed if we've got half the team on the bench, especially when it's the smarter half of the team. [Laughter] Our diversity is a strength. And we've got to leverage all of our talent in order to make ourselves as creative and solve as many problems as we can be.\nAnd one of the things I find so inspiring about these young thinkers and makers is that they look at all these seemingly intractable problems as something that we can solve. There is a confidence when you are pursuing science. They don't consider age a barrier. They don't think, well, that's just the way things are. They're not afraid to try things and ask tough questions. And above all, what we've seen today is that they feel an obligation to use their gifts to do something not just for themselves, but for other people as well.\nOlivia said after she was working on this Ebola diagnostic tool: \"My generation has been raised with an awareness that we're part of a global community. It's everybody's responsibility to take a proactive approach and think of solutions.\" She is right. I want you to call up Congress and tell them your thinking on that. [Laughter] That was just a joke. [Laughter] Maybe not. [Laughter] But it's all up to us to work together with the—our youngest talent leading the way.\nA century ago, Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves. This year, a team of scientists finally proved him right. This was very cool, by the way. I don't know if—those of you guys who had a chance to read about this—the way they measured it was the building got a little longer. [Laughter] The building that—from which they were measuring this gravitational wave grew, like, a little bit. [Laughter] And then, it kind of shrank back, which is really weird and really interesting. [Laughter]\nAnd that's the thing about science: You don't always cross the finish line yourself. You may have a hypothesis, a theory, and then people build off of it, and it's like you're running a race and you're passing a baton. Everything that we're working with today is based on some young person like you 10 years ago, 50 years ago, 100 or 300 years ago, who were asking themselves the same question. And while even Einstein didn't see all the fruits of his labor, because he went as far as his curiosity and hard work would take him, generations of scientists continue to build on his progress.\nSo that's what we're going to need from all of you. We are counting on all of you to help build a brighter future and for you to use your talents to help your communities and your country and the world. We will be with you every step of the way. And I will be keenly following your progress so that when you invent some cancer cure or find some new source of cheap, clean energy, I will take some of the credit. [Laughter] I'll say, if it hadn't been for the White House Science Fair, who knows what might have happened? Even though it won't really be my credit to take. So I'm just teasing, guys.\nThank you very much, everybody. Proud of you. Good job.", "timestamp": "2016-04-13", "title": "Remarks at the White House Science Fair"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 6 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to Sulayman Dawud al-Bakkar, an ISIL operative known as \"Abu Dawud\"; and President Bashar al-Asad of Syria.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117089", "text": "Good evening, everybody. As President and Commander in Chief, my top priority, above all else, is the security of the United States and the safety of the American people. And that means preventing terrorist attacks, and at the moment, it is focused on making sure that we are dismantling and destroying the ISIL network. I just met with my National Security Council as part of our regular effort to review and constantly intensify our campaign against ISIL. And I want to thank Director Brennan and everybody here at the Central Intelligence Agency for hosting us and for their critical contributions to this fight.\nIn late February, at our meeting at the State Department, I directed my team to continue accelerating this campaign on all fronts. And we have. This remains a difficult fight and a complex one, involving many countries and different communities in Syria and in Iraq. It is a military campaign, but it—and a counterterrorism effort, but it also depends on a whole range of political issues that face these two countries.\nAs we've seen so tragically—from Brussels to Istanbul to Iraq, where ISIL slaughtered children watching soccer—these depraved terrorists still have the ability to inflict horrific violence on the innocent, to the revulsion of the entire world. With attacks likes these, ISIL hopes to weaken our collective resolve. And once again, they have failed. Their barbarism only stiffens our unity and determination to wipe this vile terrorist organization off the face of the Earth.\nToday, on the ground in Syria and in Iraq, ISIL is on the defensive. Our 66-member coalition, including Arab partners, is on the offensive. We have momentum, and we intend to keep that momentum.\nOur air campaign—more than 1,100—11,500 strikes so far—continues to pound ISIL targets. It's harder than ever for them to move and for their masses to—or for them to mass forces. When they try, we take them out. ISIL still has managed to advance in some areas of Syria and Iraq, but it has not had a single successful major offensive operation on the ground there since last summer. So it's been nearly a year since they were able to mount a major successful offensive operation.\nWe continue to take out their leaders, their commanders, and those plotting terrorist attacks. For ISIL's leadership, it has been a bad few months. Coalition forces captured Abu Dawud, a leader of its chemical weapons program, giving us critical information that's allowed us to unleash more strikes against those sites. We have removed Abu Sarah, ISIL financier in Iraq; Haji Iman, their finance chief; Ezat al-Jabouri, an ISIL figure in northern Iraq; not to mention a number of top foreign terrorist fighters. They are off the field. And in the days and weeks ahead, we intend to take out more. Every day, ISIL leaders wake up and understand that it could be their last.\nWith coalition support, local forces continue to push ISIL back in Iraq. In Anbar Province, Iraqi forces have consolidated their gains around Ramadi and pushed up the Euphrates River Valley, liberating several villages from ISIL and retaking parts of the town of Hit. In a recent offensive in the Tigris River Valley, Iraqi forces have pushed toward Mosul. And as Secretary Kerry made clear in his visit to Baghdad last week, we will continue to assist Iraq—and so must the entire world—as it works to stabilize liberated areas and promote governance and development that is inclusive of all Iraqi communities so that ISIL cannot return.\nMeanwhile, in Syria, a coalition of local forces—some backed by U.S. Special Operations Forces—continue to make progress, pushing ISIL out of the strategic town of al-Shaddadi. ISIL was dug in there, and that battle was expected to last several weeks. Instead, ISIL was defeated in several days. With this, we've severed a critical supply line between ISIL strongholds of Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq, tightening the squeeze on ISIL in both areas. In this offensive alone, these local forces in Syria have pushed ISIL out of about 2,800 square miles. In the north, fighting continues as local forces fight to eject ISIL from its last pocket along the border with Turkey.\nIn other words, the ISIL core in Syria and Iraq continues to shrink. Their ranks of fighters are estimated to be at the lowest levels in about 2 years, and more and more of them are realizing that their cause is lost. Our cyber operations are disrupting their command-and-control and communications. We continue to target ISIL's financial infrastructure, including its oil wells, refineries, and supply lines. We've reduced their oil production and their oil revenue. And every dollar we deny them means one less dollar to pay their fighters and to fund their terror.\nAs I've said repeatedly, the only way to truly destroy ISIL is to end the Syrian civil war that ISIL has exploited. So we continue to work for a diplomatic end to this awful conflict. The cessation of hostilities in the Syrian civil war has largely held for about 6 weeks. It has reduced the violence, although not eliminated it, but that reduction is meaningful, and it's allowed some humanitarian aid to reach the Syrian people. So the cessation has saved lives. But as we're seeing around Aleppo and other areas, the cessation is tenuous and under strain. We've seen repeated violations by the Asad regime, continued attacks by Al Qaida's al-Nusra affiliate, and many Syrians continue to be deprived of desperately needed food, water, and medicine.\nTalks are now resuming in Geneva. And the United States will continue to do everything that we can to help the cessation succeed and to advance a political solution to the Syrian civil war. And that includes a vision endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, including Russia, a process that brings all Syrians together under a transitional governing body, a new Constitution, and free elections. The United States recognizes, as do people all across Syria, that such a process must include a transition away from Asad. And the future of Syria will be on the agenda when I meet with our Gulf Cooperation Council partners next week in Saudi Arabia.\nBeyond Syria and Iraq, we continue to go after ISIL wherever it tries to rear its ugly head. We're helping partners strengthen their security forces, from Africa to Afghanistan. As we, our allies and partners have made it harder for foreign terrorists to reach Syria and Iraq, we've seen an uptick in the number of ISIL fighters heading to Libya. So we're going to continue to use the full range of our tools to roll ISIL back from Libya while assisting the new and nascent Libyan Government as it works to secure their country.\nI do want to point out that even as we work to destroy ISIL, we continue to go after the remnants of Al Qaida that still pose a significant threat to U.S. interests, our allies and the homeland. In Syria, we targeted a senior leader of al-Nusra, Abu Firas al-Suri. In another strike in Syria, we took out five other Al Qaida operatives. In Yemen, our recent strike against a training camp used by Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula took out dozens of terrorist fighters. In Somalia, we took out a senior leader of al-Shabaab, Hassan Ali Dhoore, who was responsible for the attacks that killed innocent civilians, including Americans. So once again, we're sending a message: If you target Americans, you have no safe haven. We will find you.\nAnd finally, we will continue to work closely with our allies and partners, including in Europe, to stem the flow of foreign terrorist fighters and prevent attacks. I want to point out that our intelligence professionals and those of other nations have stopped numerous terrorist operatives in Syria and Iraq from entering Europe, thereby preventing attacks and gaining valuable intelligence. The world does not always hear about the success of our intelligence services, but it's a testament to the skills and tireless efforts of our intelligence professionals, and I want to make sure that the world does not forget it. Our team of experts, surge teams, recently returned from Brussels and Athens.\nAnd we're going to be sending teams to other countries so that we keep improving border security and screening of travelers and share more information. Because even the smallest gap when critical information is not shared or when a potential terrorist slips through the cracks can be deadly. And building on my invitation at our Nuclear Security Summit, we're going to continue to look for ways for intelligence services around the world to share more information against terrorist threats.\nSo it's appropriate that we're here today. It gives me a chance to thank all the dedicated men and women across the CIA and our intelligence community, as well as every level of Federal, State, and local government agencies who are involved in this effort. They are working around the clock to keep us safe. They don't get a lot of attention, but their work is tough, and it is critical, and I rely on it, and everybody up here relies on it in order to make informed decisions and to protect the American people.\nAs the stars on the Memorial Wall here attest, many have given their lives so that we can live free. We're safer because of their patriotic service. And tomorrow my National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, will address all the elements of our comprehensive strategy to destroy ISIL. That includes working with partners around the world to counter ISIL's hateful ideology, as well as protecting our homeland and working with communities here at home so that we stay resilient.\nIn closing, I want to note that we're about to mark the 3 years since the bombing of the Boston Marathon. Once again, we'll remember the lives we lost and the survivors who continue to recover: to walk and, in many cases, to run again. And I just want to remind the American people once again of what Boston taught us: how to be strong, how to be resilient.\nIn the face of terrorists who try to spread panic, we have to refuse to give in to fear. We have to stay true to our values of liberty and diversity and openness. In the face of madmen who only know how to kill, we're going to keep on living our lives and trying to lift people up. We go to our stadiums. We cheer for our teams. We thrive in our cities. We run our races, as they will next week in Boston.\nIn other words, we carry on. Terrorists like ISIL and Al Qaida, they can't destroy a great nation like the United States of America. I spent time before I came here at a science fair at the White House. You want to get a sense of why I'm always confident about America, meet some of those young people and what they're creating, what they're inventing, the diseases they're trying to cure, the energy they're trying to generate, the hope that they want to bring and the light they want to shine to the entire world. That's who we are. You can't beat that. Across more than 200 years, we've prevailed over much greater threats than the one we pose now. So we are focused, and we are going to win, in large part because of outstanding work of individuals who are here today. But we should be confident about how effective not only our military and our intelligence and our diplomatic teams are, but the basic character of the American people. As long as we hold to that, we're going to be just fine.\nThank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-04-13", "title": "Remarks on United States Strategy To Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization at the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia"}

In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead. [applause]\nOf the last nine caucuses and primaries, we have won eight of them, many of them by landslide victories. [applause]\nOver the last year, we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions, averaging — guess what — $27 apiece, more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in American history at this point in a campaign.\nThe reason that our campaign has done so well is because we're doing something very radical: We're telling the American people the truth. And the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision...[applause]... and unless we have real campaign reform so that billionaires and super PACs cannot buy elections. [applause]\nThis campaign is also determined to end a rigged economy where the rich get richer and everybody else get poorer, and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.\nThank you.\nBLITZER: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, it's great to be here in New York, and I am delighted to...[applause]... have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future. I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight years...[applause]...and to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead.\nAnd during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together. We faced 9/11. We worked hard to rebuild New York. I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others who'd been affected in their health by what they had experienced. We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.\nAnd we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together. [applause]\nAnd that is — that is exactly what I want to do as your president. We will celebrate our diversity. We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America. That's what I'm offering in this campaign, to build on the work, to build on the value that we share here in New York, to take those to Washington, and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual Americans, bur our country from reaching our full potential. That is what my campaign is about. [applause]\nBLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.\nWe are going to deal with many of the issues both of you just raised. I want to begin with a question that goes right to the heart of which one of you should be the Democratic presidential nominee.\nSenator Sanders, in the last week, you've raised questions about Secretary Clinton's qualifications to be president. You said that something is clearly lacking in terms of her judgment and you accused her of having a credibility gap.\nSo let me ask you, do you believe that Secretary Clinton has the judgment to be president?\nSANDERS: Well, I've known Secretary Clinton, how long, 25 years?\nWe worked together in the Senate. And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton, uh, campaign. \"Washington Post\" headline says \"Clinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified\" and that's what the surrogates were saying.\nDoes Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president?\nOf course she does. [applause]\nBut I do question... [applause]...but I do question her judgment. I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq...[applause]...the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street.\nI don't believe that that is...[applause]...the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need.\nBLITZER: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified. I've been called a lot of things in my life. That was a first. [laughter]\nAnd then he did say that... [applause]...he had to question my judgment. Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and...[applause]...and...[applause]...and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States. [applause]\nSo, look, we have disagreements on policy. There's no doubt about it. But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders' long interview with the \"New York Daily News,\" talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks.\nWhen asked, he could not explain how...[laughter]...that would be done and...[applause]...when asked...[applause]...when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if he'd had some paper in front of him, maybe he could.\nI think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.\nBLITZER: Senator... [applause]\nSANDERS: And let's talk about judgment.\nAnd let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country... [applause]\nI led the opposition to that war. Secretary Clinton voted for that. Well, let's talk about judgment. Let's talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed.\nWhere does the money come from?\nDo we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she's going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?\nI don't think so. [applause]\nCLINTON: Well, let me...\nSANDERS: We have...\nCLINTON: ...let me just say...\nSANDERS: ...[inaudible]...\nCLINTON: ...let me...let me say...\nBLITZER: Madam Secretary, let him finish.\nCLINTON: OK.\nSANDERS: Thirdly, we have got to understand that in America, we should be thinking big, not small. [applause]\nBLITZER: Thank you.\nSANDERS: We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people. So I...[applause]...my [inaudible].\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\nSecretary?\nCLINTON: Well, make — make no mistake about it, this is not just an attack on me, it's an attack on President Obama. President Obama...[booing]\nYou know, let me tell you why. You may not like the answer, but I'll tell you why. President Obama had a super PAC when he ran. President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors. And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations...[applause]...on Wall Street in many a year.\nSo this is — this is a phony — this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks.\nBLITZER: Thank, Secretary. We're going to continue on this, but I want Dana Bash to continue with the questioning.\nBASH: Secretary Clint, the government announced yesterday that five of the biggest banks on Wall Street have failed to develop plans to dismantle themselves in the event of another financial crisis. This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans. So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks? Something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?\nCLINTON: Absolutely. You know, this is what I've saying for the past year. No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail.\nI have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd-Frank. I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken. I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.\nThere are two sections there. If they fail either one, that they're a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you're referring to, is inadequate.\nLet's look at what is at stake here. We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again. I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York. I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law. We've got to execute under it. So, you're right. I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry. The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time...\nBASH: ... Thank you, Secretary. Senator Sanders, you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up. You said, quote, \"That's their decision.\"\nWhy would you trust the banks to restructure themselves?\nSANDERS: First, Dana...\nBASH: when you said the whole business model was fraudulent?\nSANDERS: That's right. So, let's start off with the basic premise. A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars. What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.\nGoldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same. Now, I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they're based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.\nBASH: But, Senator...\nSANDERS: The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.\nBASH: But Senator, you didn't answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?\nSANDERS: Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail. You've got to be a certain size. And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off. I don't know that it's appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions. What we need is to make sure that they are safe. [applause]\nCLINTON: Dana, you know — I love being in Brooklyn. [cheering and applause]\nDana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions. Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions. That has to be the judgement of the regulators.\nBut, there's another element to this. I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement. [applause]\nThey should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions.\nBASH: Thank you, Madam Secretary.\nCLINTON: And hold them accountable as well. [applause]\nBASH: Senator Sanders, you have consistently criticized Secretary Clinton for accepting money from Wall Street. Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received?\nSANDERS: Sure. Sure. The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession — the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that you've got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up.\nThat was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that. Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech. [applause]\nSo the problem response — the proper response in my view is we should break them up. And that's what my legislation does.\nCLINTON: Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example. [applause]\nIt is important — it's always important. It may be inconvenient, but it's always important to get the facts straight. I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.\nI called them out on their mortgage behavior. I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code. When I went to the secretary of state office, the president — President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill.\nThat is the law. Now, this is our ninth debate. In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law. You don't just say, we're upset about this. I'm upset about it. You don't just say, go break them up. You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.\nBASH: Thank you, Madam Secretary.\nCLINTON: So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said that's not enough. We've got to include the shadow banking sector.\nBASH: Thank you. Senator Sanders. [applause]\nSANDERS: Secretary Clinton called them out. Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this. And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements? So they must have been very, very upset by what you did.\nLook, here is the difference and here is the clear difference. These banks, in my view, have too much power. They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.\nIf elected president, I will break them up. We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion. [applause]\nBASH: Secretary Clinton, if I may, Senator Sanders keeping bringing up the speeches that you gave to Goldman Sachs. So I'd like to ask you, so you've said that you don't want to release the transcripts, until everybody does it, but if there's nothing in those speeches that you think would change voters' minds, why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed? [applause]\nCLINTON: You know, first of all — first of all, there isn't an issue. When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks. I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused.\nI'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.\nNow, if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you've got to look at the whole picture. It was a giant insurance company, AIG. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers. It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.\nI'm not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives...\nBASH: Madam Secretary...\nCLINTON: ... but the fact is he did.\nAnd that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade... [applause]\n[crosstalk]\nBASH: Senator Sanders, one second, please. Secretary Clinton, the question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs. [applause]\nWhy not release them?\nCLINTON: I have said, look, there are certain — there are certain expectations when you run for president. This is a new one. And I've said, if everybody agrees to do it — because there are speeches for money on the other side. I know that.\nBut I will tell you this, there is — there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go — you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns. And I've released 30 years of tax returns. And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same. [applause]\nBASH: Secretary Clinton, we're going to get to the tax returns later, but just to put a button on this, you're running now for the Democratic nomination.\nCLINTON: Right.\nBASH: And it is your Democratic opponent and many Democratic voters who want to see those transcripts. It's not about the Republicans...[crosstalk] [applause]\nCLINTON: You know, let's set the same standard for everybody. When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but let's set and expect the same standard on tax returns. Everybody does it, and then we move forward.\nBLITZER: Thank you.\nSANDERS: Well, let me respond. Secretary Clinton, you just heard her, everybody else does it, she'll do it. I will do it. [applause]\nI am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors, not for $225,000, not for $2,000, not for two cents. There were no speeches. [applause]\nAnd second of all, of course we will release our taxes. Jane does our taxes. We've been a little bit busy lately. You'll excuse us. But we will...\nBLITZER: Senator...\nSANDERS: We will get them out.\nBLITZER: Senator...\nCLINTON: Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around.\nBLITZER: Senator, when are you — when are you — you've been asked for weeks and weeks to release your tax returns.\nSANDERS: Well, I think we got one that's coming out tomorrow.\nBLITZER: Which one?\nSANDERS: Last year's.\nBLITZER: 2014?\nSANDERS: Yes.\nBLITZER: What about 2013, all the other ones?\nSANDERS: You'll get them, yes. Yeah, look, I don't want to get anybody very excited. They are very boring tax returns. No big money from speeches, no major investments. Unfortunately — unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate. And that's what that will show. [applause]\nBLITZER: So, Senator, just to be clear, tomorrow you will release the 2014 tax returns from you and your family?\nSANDERS: Yes.\nBLITZER: And what about the earlier ones? What's the problem...\nSANDERS: Yes.\nBLITZER: What's taking so long? Because you just have to go to the filing cabinet, make a copy, and release them. [applause]\nSANDERS: Wolf, the answer is, you know, what we have always done in my family is, Jane does them. And she's been out on the campaign trail. We will get them out. We'll get them out very shortly. It's not a big deal.\nBLITZER: Thank you. Senator, Senator, you've slammed companies like General Electric and Verizon for moving jobs outside of the United States. Yesterday, the CEO of Verizon called your views contemptable and said in your home state of Vermont Verizon has invested more than $16 million and pays millions of dollars a year to local businesses. He says you are, quote, \"uninformed on this issue\" and disconnected from reality. Given your obvious contempt for large American corporations, how would you as president of the United States be able to effectively promote American businesses around the world?\nSANDERS: Well, for a start, I would tell the gentleman who's the CEO at Verizon to start negotiating with the Communication Workers of America. [applause]\nAnd this is — this is a perfect example, Wolf, of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country. This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary. That's his — that's his compensation. This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers, outsource call center jobs to the Philippines, and — and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs. He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America. [applause]\nBLITZER: All right. Senator, but the question was, the question was, given your contempt for large American corporations, as president, how would you be able to promote American business around the world?\nSANDERS: First of all, the word contempt is not right. There are some great businesses who treat their workers and the environment with respect. [applause]\nVerizon happens not to be one of them. [applause]\nAnd what we need to do is to tell this guy Immelt, who's the head of General Electric, he doesn't like me, well, that's fine. He has outsourced hundreds of thousands of decent-paying jobs throughout the world...[applause]...cut his workforce here substantially and in a given year, by the way, it turns out that both Verizon and General Electric, in a given year, pay nothing in federal income tax despite making billions in profits. [booing]\nBLITZER: But Senator, experts say that no matter the means to bring back these jobs to the United States, prices of goods for consumers in the United States would go up, which would disproportionately impact the poor and middle class.\nSo how do you bring back these jobs to the United States without affecting the cost of goods to America's middle class and poor?\nSANDERS: Well, for a start, we're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. [applause]\nAnd number two, while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in McDonald's, at the end of the day, what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good-paying jobs. [applause]\nWe cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20, 30 years, based on trade agreements of which Secretary Clinton has voted for almost every one of those. That has got to change.\nBLITZER: Thank you.\nSecretary...[laughter]...Secretary Clinton? [applause]\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach. And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing. I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing.\nI have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business. And that's exactly what I will do.\nWhen I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs.\nSo I think you've got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting — more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America. And that's exactly what my plan would bring about.\nI think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened...\nBLITZER: Senator...\nCLINTON: ...in the 1990s, we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.\nBLITZER: Thank you.\nCLINTON: Let's do that again in America.\nBLITZER: Senator, how do you...\nSANDERS: I'm going to respond...\nBLITZER: I'll have you respond in a moment. [applause]\nStand by.\nSANDERS: Well, look...\nBLITZER: Secretary Clinton... [crosstalk]\nYou will respond in a moment, but I have to follow-up with Secretary Clinton.\nYou stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New York's minimum wage to $15 an hour. But you do not support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.\nAs president...[applause]...if a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it?\nCLINTON: Well, of course I would. And I have supported...[applause]...I have supported the fight for 15. I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15. I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo, with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage. I always have. I supported that when I was in the Senate.\nSANDERS: Well, look...\nCLINTON: But what I have also said is that we've got to be smart about it, just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York. If you look at it, we moved more quickly to $15 in New York City, more deliberately toward $12, $12.50 upstate then to $15. That is exactly my position. It's a model for the nation and that's what I will do as president.\nBLITZER: Thank you.\nCLINTON: Go as quickly as...[crosstalk]...to get to $15. [applause]\nSANDERS: I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. [applause]\nCLINTON: You know, wait a minute...\nSANDERS: [inaudible].\nCLINTON: ...wait a minute.\nSANDERS: [inaudible].\nCLINTON: ...wait, wait...\nSANDERS: That's just not accurate. Well...\nCLINTON: Come on, I have stood on the debate stage...\nSANDERS: ...well and I...\nCLINTON: ...with Senator Sanders eight...[crosstalk]...times.\nSANDERS: Excuse me.\nCLINTON: I have said the...\nSANDERS: Well...\nCLINTON: Exact same thing.\nBLITZER: Secretary, Senator, please.\nCLINTON: If we can...[crosstalk]...raise it to $15 in New York...[crosstalk]...or Los Angeles or Seattle...\nBLITZER: Secretary, the viewers...\nCLINTON: ...let's do it.\nBLITZER: If you're both screaming at each other, the viewers won't be able to hear either of you.\nSANDERS: OK.\nBLITZER: So please...\nSANDERS: I will...\nBLITZER: ...don't talk over each other.\nSANDERS: I believe I was...[crosstalk]\nBLITZER: Go ahead.\nSANDERS: ...responding.\nAll right? When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12. There's a difference. And, by the way, what has happened is history has outpaced Secretary Clinton, because all over this country, people are standing up and they're saying $12 is not good enough, we need $15 an hour.\nCLINTON: OK. [applause]\nBLITZER: Go ahead, Secretary. Secretary?\nSANDERS: And suddenly...\nBLITZER: Secretary, go ahead.\nSANDERS: To suddenly...\nCLINTON: Thank you. Thank you very much.\nSANDERS: To suddenly announce now that you're for $15, I don't think is quite accurate.\nBLITZER: All right. Secretary?\nCLINTON: All right. I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15. I supported those on the front lines of the fight for — it happens to be true. I also — I supported the $15 effort in L.A. I supported in Seattle. I supported it for the fast food workers in New York.\nThe minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25, right? We want to raise it higher than it ever has been, but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher, and I support that. I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it.\nGoing from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference. Thirty-five million people will get a raise. One in four working mothers will get a raise. I want to get something done. And I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15. But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15. [applause]\nBLITZER: Senator, go ahead.\nSANDERS: Well, I think the secretary has confused a lot of people. I don't know how you're there for the fight for $15 when you say you want a $12-an-hour national minimum wage. [applause]\nNow, in fact — in fact, there is an effort, Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage. That's good. I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better. [applause]\nAnd ultimately what we have got to determine is after massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent, when millions of our people are working longer hours for low wages...\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\nSANDERS: I think we have got to be clear, not equivocate, $15 in minimum wage in 50 states in this country as soon as possible.\nBLITZER: Thank you. [applause]\nWe're going to turn to another critically important issue right now, guns in America. Secretary Clinton, you've said that Vermont, Senator Sanders' home state, has, quote, \"the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York.\" But only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont. Are you seriously blaming Vermont, and implicitly Senator Sanders, for New York's gun violence?\nCLINTON: No, of course not. Of course not. This is — this is a serious difference between us. [laughter]\nAnd what I want to start by saying — it's not a laughing matter — 90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year. I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones.\nSo, yes, we have a problem in America. We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby. We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms. [applause]\nAnd what we have here is a big difference. Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.\nThen he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield. He said they didn't deserve their day in court.\nI could not disagree more.\nAnd, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one. [applause]\nThat has this kind of special protection. We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, and I agree. We've got to hold Wall Street accountable...\nBLITZER: ...Thank you...\nCLINTON: ...Well, what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in America? [cheering and applause]\nBLITZER: Senator?\nSANDERS: Well, the only problem is, Wolf, she didn't answer your question.\nYou asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible. You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence. You made the point what she said was totally absurd.\nBLITZER: I asked her, are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New York's gun violence. She said no. But, go ahead.\nSANDERS: Then why did she put out that statement?\nCLINTON: I put it out...\nSANDERS: ...Excuse me, I think I'm responding now.\nBLITZER: Please, go ahead sir.\nSANDERS: A statement that was refuted by the governor of the state of Vermont, who was a supporter of hers, who said, yeah, in campaigns people tend to exaggerate.\nHere is the fact on guns. Let's talk about guns. That horrible, horrible Sandy Hook — what's the word we want to use, murder, assault, slaughter, unspeakable act.\nBack in 1988, I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont. I probably lost that election, which I lost by three points, because I was the only candidate running who said, you know what? We should ban assault weapons, not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America.\nI've got a D-minus voting record from the NRA. [applause]\nAnd, in fact, because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country. [applause]\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you. [cheering]\nSecretary Clinton, I want you to respond to that, but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of — by guns in New York?\nCLINTON: Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state. They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.\nBut let me say this — in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost. He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.\nAnd, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here's what he said. He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent. So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA. Voting — he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.\nThankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them. [applause]\nBLITZER: Senator, I want you to respond, but I also want you to respond to this. You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages. The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting, says you owe her and families an apology. Do you?\nSANDERS: What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.\nNow, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.\nBut, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them — somebody walks in.\nThey want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.\nBLITZER: So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?\nSANDERS: No, I don't think I owe them an apology. They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today. They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.\nCLINTON: Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.\nThis is a — this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.\nAnd the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store — that was not the point of this. And if he can point to any, any incident where that happened, I would love to hear about it.\nWhat was really going on, I'll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City. New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.\nBLITZER: Thank you.\nCLINTON: The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said, stop it, stop it now, and Senator Sanders joined those who did.\nBLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.\nSenator, go ahead.\nSANDERS: Let me just reiterate — just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, let's ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America.\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\nLet's turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.\nLOUIS: Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons. It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.\nLooking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?\nCLINTON: Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it. And you mentioned some of them. The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion. [applause]\nAnd it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people. So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes.\nOn the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct. I think that sentences got much too long. The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.\nSo we have a problem. And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.\nSo I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.\nSo that's how I see it. And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.\nLOUIS: Thank you, Secretary.\nCLINTON: To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning.\nLOUIS: Now earlier this year, a South Carolina voter told your daughter Chelsea, quote, \"I think a lot of African-Americans want to hear, you know what, we made a mistake.\" Chelsea said she has heard you apologize, but went on to say that if the voter hadn't heard it then, quote, \"it's clearly insufficient.\"\nDo you regret your advocacy for the crime bill?\nCLINTON: Well, look, I supported the crime bill. My husband has apologized. He was the president who actually signed it, Senator Sanders...\nLOUIS: But what about you, Senator?\nCLINTON: ... voted for it. I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives.\nI've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.\nThat's why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue, Errol, because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make. And I also want people...[applause]...especially I want — I want white people — I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism. It's also in employment, it's in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well. [applause]\nLOUIS: Senator Sanders, earlier this week at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, you called out President Clinton for defending Secretary Clinton's use of the term super-predator back in the '90s when she supported the crime bill. Why did you call him out?\nSANDERS: Because it was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term. [applause]\nLook, much of what Secretary Clinton said was right. We had a crime bill. I voted for it. It had the Violence Against Women Act in it. When as mayor of Burlington, we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence. This took us a good step forward. We're talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook. This banned assault weapons, not insignificant.\nBut where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system. We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up. And that means, for a start — and we don't talk about this. The media doesn't talk about it — you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed. You know what I think? Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration. [applause]\nAnd I'll tell you what else. And I'll tell you what else I think. And that is, we have got — and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it. We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs. Too many lives...\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\nSANDERS: Too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana, millions over a 30-year period. And that is why I believe we should take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act. [applause]\nLOUIS: Thank you. Thank you. Let's — let's get Secretary Clinton's response.\nCLINTON: Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said. I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address. And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York. We have got to help more kids get off to a good start. That's why I want a good teacher in a good school for every child, regardless of the ZIP Code that child lives in...\nLOUIS: Thank you. Thank you, Secretary Clinton. [applause]\nCLINTON: ... and to be really focused on how we build ladders of opportunity and tear down these barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead.\nLOUIS: Your time's up, Secretary Clinton.\nSenator Sanders, I have a question for you related to this. So you've said that by the end of your first term as president, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration. To fulfill that promise, you'd have to release roughly half a million prisoners. How are you going to do that, since the vast majority of American prisoners are not under federal jurisdiction?\nSANDERS: We're going to work with state governments all over this country. And you know what? In a very divided Congress, and a very divided politics in America, actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that it's insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people.\nWith federal and presidential leadership, we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision, that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities. On this one, Errol, actually I think you're going to see progressive and conservative support. We can do it, if we're prepared to be bold.\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Secretary. We have to take a quick commercial break. We have a lot more questions for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders right after this.\n[commercial break]\nBLITZER: Welcome back.\nLet's turn to another critically important issue.\nSenator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment.\nSecretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. You say you're sick and tired of him lying about your record.\nWhat are his lies?\nCLINTON: Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world. And that's why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done.\nBut there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried — I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil. And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.\nAnd everyone who's looked at this independently, \"The Washington Post\" and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge.\nSo, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies. Best we can tell from the reports that are done.\nBut, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that. And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.\nBLITZER: Thank you. We're going to get to that to, but I want you to respond, Senator.\nSANDERS: It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers. I'm sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country. But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton's campaign. [applause]\nNow, that's not saying — and, then some people say, well, given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises it's a small amount. That's true. But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue.\nNow, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency. [cheering and applause]\nAnd, it is not good enough. You know, if we, God forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it. That was what 9/11 was about.\nWe have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances. There's going to be international conflict. [applause] I am proud, Wolf, that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation...\nBLITZER: .... Thank you...\nSANDERS: ... Including a tax on carbon. Something I don't believe Secretary Clinton supports. [cheering and applause]\nBLITZER: Secretary Clinton, go ahead and respond.\nCLINTON: Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis. Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions. [applause]\nI continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change. [applause]\nAnd, I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement, said it was not enough, it didn't go far enough. You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment...\nBLITZER: ... Thank you...[cheering and applause]\nCLINTON: ... And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism...\nBLITZER: ... Go ahead, Senator...\nSANDERS: ... Let's talk about that. When you were Secretary of State, you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world. [cheering]\nThe issue here — of course the agreement is a step forward, but you know agreements and I know agreements, there's a lot of paper there. We've got to get beyond paper right now.\nWe have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system, not tomorrow, but yesterday. [applause] And, what that means, Wolf, it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry. Now, I am on board legislation that says, you know what, we ain't going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land. That's not Secretary Clinton's position.\nBLITZER: Thank you.\nSANDERS: Let us support a tax on carbon...\nBLITZER: ... Secretary Clinton...\nSANDERS: ... Not Secretary Clinton's position.\nBLITZER: ... Go ahead and respond. [applause]\nCLINTON: Well, I'm a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant. He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take. [applause]\nAnd, you know, I am getting a little bit — I'm getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported. [cheering and applause]\nNow, it's easy — it's easy to diagnose the problem. It's harder to do something about the problem. And... [applause]\nBLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. We'll continue on this. Errol — Errol Louis, go ahead with your question.\nSANDERS: Wolf. Wolf.\nBLITZER: We're going to continue on this. Errol, go ahead.\nLOUIS: OK. Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, you also pioneered a program to promote fracking around the world, as you described. Fracking, of course, a way of extracting natural gas. Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time you're done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country. Why have you changed your view on fracking?\nCLINTON: No, well, I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas.\nAnd so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense. So we did say natural gas is a bridge. We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.\nThat's why I've set big goals. I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years. [applause]\nSo I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.\nLOUIS: Thank you, Secretary. All right, Senator?\nSANDERS: All right, here is — here is a real difference. This is a difference between understanding that we have a crisis of historical consequence here, and incrementalism and those little steps are not enough. [applause]\nNot right now. Not on climate change. Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world. Second of all, right now, we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. [applause]\nAnd that means — and I would ask you to respond. Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do? [applause]\nCLINTON: You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.\nI don't take a back seat to your legislation that you've introduced that you haven't been able to get passed. I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis. That's exactly what I have proposed.\nLOUIS: OK, thank you, Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing.\nLOUIS: Senator Sanders, you've said that climate change is the greatest change to our nation's security.\nSANDERS: Secretary Clinton did not answer one simple question.\nLOUIS: Excuse me, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator...\nSANDERS: Are you for a tax on carbon or not?\nLOUIS: I have a question for you. You've said that climate change is the greatest threat to our nation's security. You've called for a nationwide ban on fracking. You've also called for phasing out all nuclear power in the U.S. But wouldn't those proposals drive the country back to coal and oil, and actually undermine your fight against global warming?\nSANDERS: No, they wouldn't. Look, here's where we are. Let me reiterate. We have a global crisis. Pope Francis reminded us that we are on a suicide course. Our legislation understands, Errol, that there will be economic dislocation. It is absolutely true. There will be some people who lose their job. And we build into our legislation an enormous amount of money to protect those workers. It is not their fault that fossil fuels are destroying our climate.\nBut we have got to stand up and say right now, as we would if we were attacked by some military force, we have got to move urgently and boldly.\nWhat does that mean?\nLOUIS: Senator — senator, jobs...jobs are one thing, but with less than 6 percent of all U.S. energy coming from solar, wind and geothermal, and 20 percent of U.S. power coming from nuclear, if you phase out all of that, how do you make up that deficit?\nSANDERS: Well, you don't it all out tomorrow. And you certainly don't phase nuclear out tomorrow. But this is what you do do. [applause]\nWhat you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program — and I had introduced — introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops. We can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country. [cheering]\nSaving — rebuilding our rail system. [applause]\nOur mass transit system. [applause]\nIf we approach this, Errol, as if we were literally at a war — you know, in 1941, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we moved within three years, within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism. That is exactly the kind of approach we need right now.\nBLITZER: Thank you. [applause]\nSANDERS: Lead the world.\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator. [applause]\nLet's turn to another critically important issue...[applause]...the issue of national security and foreign policy.\nSecretary Clinton, President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed. You were his secretary of State.\nAren't you also responsible for that?\nCLINTON: Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi's demise. And here's what we did.\nWe helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.\nI was very proud of that.\nWe got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had, getting it out of Libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups.\nWe also worked to help them set up their government. We sent a lot of American experts there. We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military.\nThey, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya.\nAnd so we were caught in a very difficult position. They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn't want to have others helping to provide that security.\nAnd the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country.\nAnd we can't walk away from that. We need to be working with European and Arab partners...\nBLITZER: Thank you.\nCLINTON: ...with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them.\nThe Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government. And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them\nBLITZER: Senator, go ahead.\nSANDERS: According to \"The New York Times.\"...[applause]...for President Obama, this was a pretty tough call, like a 51-49 call, do you overthrow Qadafi, who, of course, was a horrific dictator?\n\"The New York Times\" told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change. And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq. [applause]\nLook...[applause]...Qadafi, Saddam Hussein are brutal, brutal murdering thugs. No debate about that.\nBut what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didn't think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators.\nRegime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold. And I think if you studied the whole history of...\nBLITZER: Yes.\nSANDERS: ...American involvement in regime change, you see that quite often.\nBLITZER: Secretary, we're going to let you respond. [applause]\nCLINTON: Yes, well, I...[applause]...I...[applause]...I — I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support.\nSenator sanders voted for that, and that's exactly what we did.\nSANDERS: No.\n[crosstalk]\nCLINTON: We went to the United Nations — yes, he did. We went to the United Nations Security Council. We got support from the Security Council. And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.\nThis was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them. And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria.\nNobody stood up to Assad and removed him, and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya. [applause]\n[crosstalk]\nBLITZER: Senator, go ahead.\nSANDERS: Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesn't make it truer. What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent, you know what that is, where basically, do we support Libya moving to democracy?\nWell, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy. But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after. Totally different issue.\nCLINTON: Well, that isn't...\nSANDERS: Second of all — second of all, if I might, in terms of Syria, in terms of Syria...\nBLITZER: Senator, let her respond to that, then we'll get to that.\nGo ahead, Secretary.\nCLINTON: There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you're not shy when you oppose something, Senator. So, yes, it was unanimous. That's exactly right, including you.\nAnd what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners. The decision was the president's. Did I do the due diligence? Did I talk to everybody I could talk to? Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president? Yes, I did. That's what a secretary of state does.\nBut at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power. And the president made that decision. And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.\nBLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.\nGo ahead, Senator.\nSANDERS: If you listen, you know — two points. Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again. But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be.\nSecond of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.\nThirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.\nCLINTON: Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point. Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad.\nThe president said no. Now, that's how it works. People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision. So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.\nAnd, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.\nBLITZER: Staying on national security, Dana Bash has a question.\nBASH: Senator Sanders, in 1997, you said this about NATO, you said, quote: \"It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO.\"\nDo you still feel that way?\nSANDERS: Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO. Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense. Yes, I do. [applause]\nBASH: And just following up, Senator Sanders, Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share. So how is what you say about NATO and your proposal different than his?\nSANDERS: Well, you got to ask — you got to ask Trump. All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, they're doing pretty well.\nSo I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies. You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden. Nothing wrong with that. [applause]\nBASH: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: I support our continuing involvement in NATO. And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost. There is a requirement that they should be doing so, and I believe that needs to be enforced.\nBut there's a larger question here. NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history. It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face. So...\nBASH: But, Madam Secretary...\nCLINTON: ... yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave, because I don't think that's in America's interests.\nBASH: That's going to be part of my — my question to you is, to that point, there are 28 countries in the alliance, and the United States gives more money to NATO's budget than 21 of those countries combined. If they don't agree to pay more, as you suggested, then what would you do as commander-in-chief?\nCLINTON: I will stay in NATO. I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support. Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan. Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan. They came to our rallying defense after 9/11. That meant a lot.\nAnd, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let's not forget what's really happening. With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests. Think of how much it would cost if Russia's aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward. [applause]\nBLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.\nSenator, let's talk about the U.S. relationship with Israel. Senator Sanders, you maintained that Israel's response in Gaza in 2014 was, quote, \"disproportionate and led to the unnecessary loss of innocent life.\" [applause]\nWhat do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit?\nSANDERS: Well, as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel, who has family in Israel, of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves, but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack. That is not a debate. [applause]\nBut — but what you just read, yeah, I do believe that. Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks, has every right in the world to destroy terrorism. But we had in the Gaza area — not a very large area — some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Free Palestine!\nSANDERS: Now, if you're asking not just me, but countries all over the world was that a disproportionate attack, the answer is that I believe it was, and let me say something else. [cheering and applause]\nAnd, let me say something else. As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run — and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity. [cheering and applause]\nSo what is not to say — to say that right now in Gaza, right now in Gaza unemployment is s somewhere around 40%. You got a log of that area continues, it hasn't been built, decimated, houses decimated health care decimated, schools decimated. I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.\nThat does not make me anti-Israel. That paves the way, I think...\nBLITZER: ... Thank you, Senator...\nSANDERS: ...to an approach that works in the Middle East. [cheering and applause]\nBLITZER: Thank you. Secretary Clinton, do you agree with Senator Sanders that Israel overreacts to Palestinians attacks, and that in order for there to be peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel must, quote, end its disproportionate responses?\nCLINTON: I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012. I did it in concert with... [applause]\nPresident Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet. I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks. They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages. [applause]\nThey do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel. And, so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets, taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me, I was in Cambodia, that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldn't find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it, I flew all night, I got there, I negotiated that.\nSo, I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you. You have a right to defend yourself. [applause]\nThat does not mean — that does not mean that you don't take appropriate precautions. And, I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war. It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution, which would give the Palestinians the rights and...\nBLITZER: ... Thank you...\nCLINTON: ... just let me finish. The rights and the autonomy that they deserve. And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years. [cheering and applause]\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator, go ahead — go ahead, Senator.\nSANDERS: I don't think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country. That is not the issue.\nAnd, you evaded the answer. You evaded the question. The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism. That's not the debate. Was their response disproportionate?\nI believe that it was, you have not answered that. [cheering]\nCLINTON: I will certainly be willing to answer it. I think I did answer it by saying that of course there have to be precautions taken but even the most independent analyst will say the way that Hamas places its weapons, the way that it often has its fighters in civilian garb, it is terrible.\nI'm not saying it's anything other than terrible. It would be great — remember, Israel left Gaza. They took out all the Israelis. They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people.\nAnd what happened? Hamas took over Gaza.\nSo instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere.\nBLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.\nSenator.\nSANDERS: I read Secretary Clinton's statement speech before AIPAC. I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people. Almost none in that speech. [applause]\nSo here is the issue: of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.\nThat is what I believe the world wants to us do and that's the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise.\nCLINTON: Well, if I — I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it. And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husband's efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel.\nThere were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me. Three long meetings. And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.\nI was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government. And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israel's security. [applause]\nBLITZER: A final word, Senator, go ahead.\nSANDERS: There comes a time — there comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time. [applause]\nCLINTON: Well...\nBLITZER: Secretary.\nCLINTON: ... you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders. Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right, but it is a difficult position.\nIf you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace, trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist, that is a very difficult challenge.\nBLITZER: Senator, go ahead.\nSANDERS: You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians. And I think, again, it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents, including President Clinton and others, Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing.\nAll that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided. There are two sides to the issue.\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Secretary.\nWe have to take another quick, quick break. But much more on the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Brooklyn, New York. That is coming up right after this.\n[commercial break]\nBLITZER: Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate. We're here in Brooklyn. Secretary, Senator, both of you talk about major reforms to college tuition, health care, and Social Security, all of which will take significant changes from Congress, currently controlled by Republicans.\nSenator Sanders, you're promising health care and free college for all, and those plans would be met with both political and practical challenges. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says your initiatives would cost up to $28 trillion and, even after massive tax increases, that would add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt. How is this fiscally responsible?\nSANDERS: Well, first of all, I disagree with that study. There are many economists who come up with very, very different numbers.\nFor example, we are the only country, major country on Earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do, 50 percent more than the French. My proposal, a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will save...[applause]...will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs. Public colleges and universities tuition free? Damn right. That is exactly what we should be doing. [applause]\nAnd I'd pay for that — I'd pay for that by telling Wall Street that, yeah, we are going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will bring in more than enough money to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities and lower the outrageous level of student debt.\nWolf, we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent. The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country. [applause]\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Secretary, go ahead and respond.\nCLINTON: Well, again — again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we've got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I've worked on for 25 years. Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare. And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent.\nAnd with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable. We are pricing out middle-class, working, and poor families. There's no doubt about that.\nBut I do think when you make proposals and you're running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans...[applause]...are actually going to work. And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out — remember, he had a plan for about, I don't know, 18, 20 years. He changed in the middle of this campaign. He put out another plan. People have been analyzing the new plan. And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals. In fact, the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor. A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300.\nThe same for free college. The free college offer — you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print. You read the fine print, and here's what it says.\nBLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.\nCLINTON: The fine print says this, that it will — the federal government will cover two-thirds of the cost and require the states, even those led by Republican governors...\nBLITZER: Senator, go ahead. Thank you.\nCLINTON: ... to carry out what the remaining one-third of the cost.\nSANDERS: I know what Secretary Clinton is saying.\nBLITZER: Secretary please.\nSANDERS: We are not a country that has the courage to stand up to big money and do what has to be done for the working families of the country. [applause]\nSecretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on Earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people, spending significantly less per capita than we can.\nI live 50 miles away from Canada, you know? It's not some kind of communist authoritarian country. They're doing OK. They got a health care system that guarantees health care to all people. We can do the same.\nIn terms of public colleges and universities, please don't tell me that we cannot do what many other countries around the world are doing. Kids should not be punished and leave school deeply in debt, for what crime? For trying to get an education.\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\nSANDERS: So, yes, we are going to pay for it...\nCLINTON: Well...\nBLITZER: Secretary Clinton — Secretary Clinton, go ahead.\nCLINTON: We have — we have a difference of opinion. We both want to get to universal health care coverage. I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces, the health insurance companies and the drug companies. [applause]\nAnd perhaps that's why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama's signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress. So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody...\nBLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.\nCLINTON: ... let's get to 100 percent coverage, let's get the cost down, and let's guarantee health care.\nBLITZER: Secretary, let's talk about Social Security, another critically important issue. Senator Sanders has challenged you to give a clear answer when it comes to extending the life of Social Security and expanding benefits. Are you prepared to lift the cap on taxable income, which currently stands at $118,500? Yes or no, would you lift the cap?\nCLINTON: I have said repeatedly, Wolf, I am going to make the wealthy pay into Social Security to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. That is one way. If that is the way that we pursue, I will follow that.\nBut there are other ways. We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people. We should be looking at taxing all of their investment.\nBut here's the real issue, because I — I've heard this, I've seen the reports of it. I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security. I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.\nBut we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now. And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind.\nAnd it's time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security...\nBLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.\nCLINTON: ...system and that will be my highest priority.\nBLITZER: Senator?\nGo ahead, Senator. [applause]\nSANDERS: An interesting comment, but you didn't answer the question.\nCLINTON: I did. If that's the way we're...\nSANDERS: No, you didn't. My legi...\nCLINTON: ...yes, I did.\nSANDERS: Can I answer...\nCLINTON: I did answer the...\nSANDERS: ...may I please...\nCLINTON: Well, don't — don't put words...\nSANDERS: ...can I have... [crosstalk]\nCLINTON: ...into my mouth and say something...\nSANDERS: ...do I not?\nCLINTON: ...that's not accurate.\nBLITZER: Go ahead, Senator.\nSANDERS: All right. Essentially what you described is my legislation, which includes [inaudible]... [applause]\nNow, we've got — here is the issue. Your answer has been the same year after year. In fact, the idea that I'm bringing forth, I have to admit it, you know, it wasn't my idea. It was Barack Obama's idea in 2008, the exact same idea. [applause]\nHe called for lifting the cap, which is now higher — it's at 118 — and starting at 250 and going on up. If you do that, you're going to extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. You will significantly expand benefits by 1,300 bucks a year for seniors and disabled vets under $16,000 a year.\nWhat's wrong with that?\nAre you prepared to support it?\nCLINTON: I have supported it. You know, we are in vigorous agreement here, Senator.\nSANDERS: You have sup...\nCLINTON: I think it's important...[applause]...to point out that...[applause]...you know, we're — we're having a discussion about the best way to raise money from wealthy people to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. Think about what the other side wants to do. They're calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme. They still want to privatize it.\nIn fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street, something you and I would never let happen.\nSANDERS: All right, so...\nCLINTON: So, yes, we both want to make sure... [applause]\nSANDERS: Look, Wolf...\nCLINTON: ...Social Security [inaudible]...\nSANDERS: ...I am very glad that...\n[crosstalk]\nCLINTON: ...and well-funded...\nSANDERS: I am very glad to...\n[crosstalk]\nBLITZER: Thank you, Secretary.\n[crosstalk]\nBLITZER: Senator, go ahead.\nSANDERS: ...campaign of challenging, if I hear you correctly, Madam Secretary, you are now coming out finally in favor of lifting the cap on taxable income...[applause]...and extending and expanding Social Security. If that is the case, welcome on board. I'm glad you're here. [applause]\nCLINTON: No.\nBLITZER: Thank you.\nErrol — Errol Louis, go ahead. [applause]\nCLINTON: We are going...[applause]...we are... [applause]...we are going...\nLOUIS: Secretary...\nCLINTON: I — as he said, I've said the same thing for years. I didn't say anything different tonight. We are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. There is still something called Congress. Now, I happen to support Democrats and I want to get Democrats to take back the majority in the United States Senate...\nBLITZER: Errol...\nCLINTON: ...so a lot of — a lot of what we're talking about can actually be implemented...\nBLITZER: Errol, hold on a second.\nCLINTON: ...when I am president.\nLOUIS: Secretary...\nBLITZER: Go ahead.\nHold on, Errol...\nSANDERS: ...I'm still...\nBLITZER: ...Errol. Hold on.\nSANDERS: I've got to admit...\nBLITZER: Go ahead, Senator.\nSANDERS: ...maybe I'm a little bit confused.\nAre you or are you not supporting legislation to lift the cap on taxable income and expand Social Security for 58 years and increase benefits...\nCLINTON: I am...\nSANDERS: ...yes or no?\nCLINTON: I have said yes, we are going to pick the best way or combination...\nSANDERS: Oh, you — ah. [applause] [booing]\nOK.\nCLINTON: ...or combination of ways...[booing]...you know...[booing]...it — it's all — it's always a little bit, uh, challenging because, you know, if Senator Sanders doesn't agree with how you are approaching something, then you are a member of the establishment.\nWell, let me say then...\nSANDERS: Well, look... [applause]\nCLINTON: ...let me say this... [applause]...we are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. We've got some good ideas to do it. Let's get a Congress elected...\nBLITZER: Thank you.\nCLINTON: ...that will actually agree...\nBLITZER: Well, thank you...\nCLINTON: ...with us in doing it.\nBLITZER: Errol, go ahead.\nLOUIS: OK, Secretary Clinton, I've got a question for you from a reader...\n[crosstalk]\nSANDERS: Let me interject here.\nLOUIS: ...of the \"New York Daily News.\"\nSANDERS: Yes, Secretary Clinton...[crosstalk]...you are a member of the establishment.\nLOUIS: ...this was a reader...\nSANDERS: [inaudible].\nLOUIS: ...of \"The Daily News\" who sent us a...[cheering]...a question for you.\nJust a second, Senator.\nHannah Green wants to know your position, Secretary Clinton, regarding President Obama's nomination of Merrick Gaarland to the Supreme m Court. President Obama said earlier this week that he would not withdraw the nomination, even after the presidential election. If elected, would you ask the president to withdraw the nomination?\nCLINTON: I am not going to contradict the president's strategy on this. And I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals. I fully support the president. [applause]\nAnd I believe that the president — the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history. And the Senate needs to immediately begin to respond. So I'm going to support the president. When I am president, I will take stock of where we are and move from there.\nLOUIS: Senator Sanders.\nSANDERS: Well, there is no question. I mean, it really is an outrage. And it just continues, the seven-and-a-half years of unbelievable obstructionism we have seen from these right-wing Republicans.\nI mean, a third-grader in America understands the president of the United States has the right to nominate individuals to the U.S. Supreme Court. Apparently everybody understands that except the Republicans in Congress.\nLOUIS: So, Senator Sanders, would you ask him to withdraw the nomination?\nSANDERS: Yes, but here is the point, and obviously i will strongly support that nomination as a member of the Senate. But, if elected president, I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination because I think — I think this.\nI think that we need a Supreme Court justice who will make it crystal clear, and this nominee has not yet done that, crystal clear that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United and make sure that American democracy is not undermined. [applause]\nCLINTON: You know, there is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe V. Wade is settled law and Citizens United needs to be overturned.\nAnd I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake. We've had eight debates before, this is our ninth. We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question. [applause]\nAnd in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women's rights. We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished. And we are never asked about this.\nAnd to be complete in my concern, Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction. I don't think it's a distraction. It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks.\nBASH: Senator Sanders, your response.\nSANDERS: You're looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record, who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman's right to choose, who will take on those governors right now who are discriminating outrageously against the LGBT community, who comes from a state which led the effort for gay marriage in this country, proudly so. [applause]\nBASH: Thank you, Senator.\nSANDERS: Who not only thinks we are not going to — not defund Planned Parenthood, we've got to expand funding for Planned Parenthood. [applause]\nBASH: Senator Sanders, you've spoken a lot tonight about your votes in Congress. You have been in Congress for over a quarter of the century, and there as an independent, not a Democrat.\nNow you're seeking the Democratic nomination, but Secretary Clinton has suggested that she's not even sure you are a Democrat. Are you?\nSANDERS: Well, why would I be running for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States? [applause]\nBut here is a good point. You know, in virtually all of the general election match-up polls between Trump and Secretary Clinton and Trump and Bernie Sanders, in almost all of those polls, I do better than Secretary Clinton both in the CNN poll I was 20 points ahead of Trump.\nI think Secretary Clinton was 12 points. And you know why? Because in fact a whole lot of people — this may be a shock to the secretary, but there a whole lot of independents in this country. [applause]\nBASH: Senator Sanders...\nSANDERS: And we are not going to win the White House based on just long-term Democratic votes. We have got to reach out to independents and I think I am well qualified to do that.\nBASH: Senator Sanders. [applause]\nSANDERS: I am in this race as a Democrat. I have raised millions of dollars for my colleagues in the United States Senate to help them get elected. I will do everything I can to open the Democratic party to the young people who are flocking into our political campaign. [cheering]\nBASH: On that very subject, on that very subject, Secretary Clinton mentions electing a Democratic congress several times. She says that she raised $15 million for the Democratic party in the first three months of this year. You don't appear to have raised any money for the party. Yesterday you did announce that you will help three members of Congress who have endorsed you. Why aren't you doing more to help the party you say you want to lead?\nSANDERS: The truth is, and you can speak to my colleagues, we have raised millions of dollars to the DSCC. I have written letter that have raised, if I may use the word, huge amount of money so that's just not accurate.\nBut, I will also say, and this is important and maybe the Secretary disagrees with me, but I am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it, and I do believe, I do believe that we have got to open the door of the Democratic party to those people. [applause]\nAnd, I think the future of the Democratic party is not simply by raising money from wealthy campaign contributors. I think that the way we are doing it in this campaign...\nBASH: ... Thank you Senator.\nSANDERS: $27 a contribution...\nBASH: ... Senator, your time is up...\nSANDERS: not being dependent on Wall Street, or big money, that is the future of the Democratic Party that I want to see. [cheering and applause]\nBASH: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Let us talk about where we are in this race. I've gotten more votes than anybody running. 9.6 million at the last count. [cheering and applause]\nThat is 2.3 million more than Senator Sanders. [applause]\nAnd it is 1.4 million more than Donald Trump. [cheering and applause]\nI think you have to look at the facts. And, the facts are that I'm putting together a very broad-based, inclusive coalition from the South to the North, from the East to the West, with African-American, Latinos, women, union households, working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running. It is a campaign that will not only capture the Democratic nomination, but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republican end up nominating. [cheering and applause]\nBASH: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Senator Sanders. [cheering and applause]\nCLINTON: And, I want to say — I also want to say that I do — I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process. I applaud all of those who are applauding you, Senator Sanders. We're happy that they are supporting you, that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues.\nBut, let me also say it's going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed...\nBASH: ... Secretary Clinton, thank you.\nCLINTON: And, I know something about that...\nBASH: ... Secretary Clinton...\nCLINTON: Thank you so much. Because, when I went to the very end of the 2008 campaign with then Senator Obama...\nBASH: ...Secretary Clinton, you're out of time...\nCLINTON: ... We did unify the party, and we did elect a Democratic president...\nBASH: ...Senator Sanders, on that note....\nSANDERS: ... Let me, if I may just briefly say something...\nBASH: ... Senator Sanders, I want to ask you a question about this, and you can incorporate that into your response. Three months now between now and the Democratic convention. Your campaign manager says that you will absolutely take the fight to the floor if neither you nor Secretary Clinton clinches the nomination with pledged delegates alone. [applause]\nDo you vow to take this fight to Philadelphia no matter what?\nSANDERS: I think we're going to win this nomination to tell you the truth. [cheering]\nLook, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true. Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South. No question about it. We got murdered there. That is the most conservative part of this great country. That's the fact.\nBut you know what? We're out of the Deep South now. And we're moving up. We got here. We're going to California. We got a number of large states there. And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that we're going to win this nomination, and I believe we're going to obliterate Donald Trump or whoever the Republican candidate is. [applause]\nCLINTON: Now, let me say this...\nBLITZER: Secretary Clinton, go ahead.\nCLINTON: I think it's — I think it's important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates. And my lead in pledged delegates is actually wider than Barack Obama's lead was over me.\nAnd in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri. [applause]\nAnd so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter. I'm not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place.\nSo I'm going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday. I'm going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California. And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention...\nBLITZER: Senator, go ahead.\nCLINTON: ... that we'll go onto the general election with.\nSANDERS: The reason — the reason why in virtually every contest we are winning by very strong margins younger people — and I'm not just talking about very young. You know, the older you get, the younger young gets — 45 or younger — is I think people are sensing that establishment politics and dependence on Wall Street and big money interest is really never going to address the crises that we face. [applause]\nAnd people understand, you can't take money from powerful special interests into your PAC and then really expect the American people to believe you're going to stand up to these powerful special interests. So I am very proud of the fact that we have brought millions of new people into the political process...\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\nSANDERS: ... many of whom previously had given up.\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator, very much. The candidates, they will make their final pitches to New York voters right after this. [applause]\n[commercial break]\nBLITZER: Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate. It's time for the candidates' closing statements. Each candidate will have two minutes. Senator Sanders, you're first.\nSANDERS: I grew up in Brooklyn, New York...[applause]...the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud American, because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college.\nI believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life. And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country. I just don't accept that.\nWhat I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes.\nAnd we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent. [applause]\nThat is what the political revolution is about. That is what this campaign is about. And with your help, we're going to win here in New York. Thank you. Thank you. [applause]\nBLITZER: Secretary Clinton? Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Thank you. I am very grateful for the fact that the people of New York gave me the great honor of serving as your senator. You took a chance on me in 2000, and then you re-elected me with one of the biggest margins we've had in our state in 2006. During those years, we worked closely together. I tried to have your back, and time and time again, you had mine.\nWe took on the challenges of 9/11 together. We got the money to rebuild New York. We came to the aid of our brave first responders, construction workers, and others who endangered their own health by helping to save lives and search for survivors. [applause]\nWe worked to create jobs — despite the disastrous policies of George W. Bush — across New York. And we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests.\nI'm asking for your support again in the primary on Tuesday to continue that work together, to take what we did in New York and to take those New York values to the White House, and put them to work on behalf of all of our people, to knock down the barriers that stand in the way.\nYou know, of course we have economic barriers. I've been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life. But we also have racial barriers, gender barriers, homophobic barriers, disability barriers. [applause]\nWe have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.\nSo I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday. I'll work my heart out for you again. And together, we won't just make promises we can't keep. We'll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people in New York and in America. [applause]\nThat's what we'll do together. Thank you, New York. [applause]\nBLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. Thank you very much, Senator.\nI want to thank the candidates for a really terrific debate. Thanks also to Dana Bash and Errol Louis, as well as NY1, the Democratic National Committee, and everyone here at the Duggal Greenhouse at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.", "timestamp": "2016-04-14", "title": "Democratic Candidates Debate in Brooklyn, New York"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117075", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:05 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Before we get started, I've got a couple of pieces of news I wanted to go through just to bring to your attention.\nThe first is -- and this may be something that you've already seen -- earlier today, there was an announcement from Ambassador Froman over at the Office of the United States Trade Representative. He was joined by a handful of members of Congress from across the country. And they announced that the United States has won an agreement on a WTO complaint that we filed against China for a wide-ranging subsidy program that they had created to unfairly pump up their exports into the world market, including into the United States.\nThis unfair subsidy program was designed to prop up industries in China that are in direct competition with American workers and American businesses. It's a pretty wide range of industries that were affected -- everything from textiles to clothing to advanced materials, metals, as well as some other industrial categories like medical products and specialty chemicals. So the victory that the United States secured will help level the playing field for everyone -- for medical device makers in California to textile workers in North Carolina to those in the shrimp industry along the Gulf Coast.\nThis is just another example of the administration holding our trading partners' feet to the fire. In fact, since 2009, the Obama administration has brought 20 enforcement cases at the World Trade Organization. That's more than any other member country. And that includes 11 against China. That is significantly more than the prior administration. And of the cases that have been decided by the WTO, we've won them all. We're undefeated. And it is an example of how committed this administration is to ensuring that we're fighting in the international community for American businesses and American workers.\nAnd so I wanted to bring that announcement to your attention. There's one other short presentation that I wanted to do before I got to your questions, and it includes a couple of visual aids. For those of you who are planning at home -- Monday is Tax Day. It's the deadline for filing your taxes. And it is a convenient time to review this administration's record when it comes to tax policy.\nMany of you will recall that back in 2007, when then-Senator Obama was running for President, he talked extensively about how our country's tax policy was skewed toward the top 1 percent. He was concerned that it was skewed in a direction that was not favorable to the middle class. And those of you who have been covering us for the last seven years are familiar with the President's strategy that our economy is strongest when we're growing it from the middle out. And that is the case that the President made to making some reforms to our tax system.\nSo let's go to the first slide. When the President took office, obviously our country was facing the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. And as a part of the Recovery Act, the average middle-class family, the typical middle-class family enjoyed tax cuts totaling $3,600 over the first four years. That included the expansion of some tax credits, things like the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and the American Opportunity Tax Credit that makes college education a little bit more affordable.\nLast year, in the budget agreement, we succeeded in making many of those tax credits permanent, and that's why we can say that about 24 million middle-class families and those families that are working to get into the middle class enjoy an average of a thousand dollars tax break as a result of this administration's policies.\nSo we do that because we believe that's fair. These are a set of incentives that we believe are good for the economy and good for middle-class families, and they are entirely consistent with our strategy to grow the economy from the middle class out.\nThe second slide is one that may serve as a source of disappointment to many of our critics. This slide illustrates the median tax rate that is paid -- or the tax rate that is paid by the median taxpaying family in the United States. So, essentially, this is the average tax rate that's paid by middle-class families in the United States. You'll see that this tax rate is lower under President Obama's leadership than any President dating back to President Eisenhower. Again, this is consistent with the strategy that the President laid out as a candidate for President. We're focused on keeping taxes for the middle class low and looking for opportunities to lower them when they present themselves. That's exactly what we've done. And part of the budget agreement from 2012 actually did succeed in locking in on a permanent basis for the middle class. And the President is proud of that record, and that's had an impact on the tax rate that is paid by the median family here in the United States.\nMany of you will note, if you're looking closely at the numbers -- and we can pass these out, for those of you who are, unfortunately, on the wrong side of the podium here -- that the average tax rate, or the tax rate that is paid by the median family in the United States today is paying about half the tax rate that the median family paid under President Reagan. So that I think is an indication of the President's priorities of focusing on the middle class really showing through here.\nThe last slide is another part of the President's promise. This is an illustration of how tax rates have gone up for those at the top of income scale. The President often has talked about how important it is for those at the top to pay their fair share. And part of the budget agreement that I referenced that was enacted over the course of the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013 -- many of you will recall that holiday season -- we permanently increased taxes on those at the top. And this is an illustration of the impact that that has had over the course of President Obama tenure in office.\nSo this is indicative of the strategy that the President has laid out for not just for our tax policy, for our economy. I think the results speak for themselves, both in terms of the impact that they have on taxes but also for the impact that they have had on our economy.\nTo date, as we have talked about many times here, the U.S. economy has created jobs for 73 consecutive months. That's about 14.4 million private sector jobs. This, of course, IS the longest consecutive streak on record. And just today we got an interesting piece of news as well. We typically refrain from talking about any specific weekly report related to job claims. These are individuals who have filed for unemployment. This week that number is lower than it has been at any time since 1973. These are weekly numbers, so there's some volatility to it. But I think it is a good illustration of the continuing and enduring strength of the U.S. economy and the U.S. job market. And all of that was -- has taken place at the same time that the President has reformed our tax system in a way that has benefitted middle-class families and asked those at the top to pay more of their fair share.\nSo with Tax Day right around the corner, it seemed like a convenient time to bring all that information to your attention. We can get you these slides electronically for your use as you're working on stories over the weekend preparing for Tax Day.\nSo with all of that, we can now go to your questions. Kevin, do you want to start?\nQ: Thank you, Josh. So some of the swing-state Republican senators that Judge Garland met with today and yesterday say they are unmoved after their meeting. So you appear to have met with your target audience or most of your target audience, And those folks haven't changed their position at all. I wanted to ask, so where does that leave this nomination? Are you at a dead end now after these meetings?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, some of them did change their position in agreeing to meet with Judge Garland in the first place. So that is an indication that the kind of pressure that Republicans are facing for not doing their job is forcing them in the direction of doing more of their job, at least. But ultimately, I do think we are in a place where Republicans have to decide how they're going to answer the question about why their constituents can't hear from Judge Garland.\nMany of these Republicans have suggested that they believe that their constituents should have a voice in the process. Frankly, we agree. So let's -- don't just meet with Chief Judge Garland in private. You've had the opportunity to visit with him in private. You've had an opportunity to ask him tough questions. Why not do it in public? Chief Judge Garland certainly isn't scared of that prospect. I don't understand why Republican senators would be either.\nAnd the thing that we have seen from Republicans that I do think is a reflection of the increasing pressure that they're facing isn't just true of Republicans who are in so-called swing states; it's also true of Republicans who are in conservative red states.\nJust yesterday, we saw Idaho Senator Jim Risch come out and say that \"The Supreme Court is very, very political, just like Congress.\" Well, the truth is, our Founding Fathers intended a justice system that insulated the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary from day-to-day politics. That's part of why they envisioned lifetime appointments for judges, so that they wouldn't have to run for reelection and that they wouldn't face political pressure so intensely. That would allow them to focus on their job of interpreting the law.\nNow, the truth is that even though they're shorthanded, the United States Supreme Court has tried to move forward and do their job, even in the aftermath of the untimely death of Justice Scalia. But I guess that's where the Supreme Court is not just like the Congress -- because we have seen the Supreme Court try to move forward and do their job; the Congress hasn't. And, frankly, I think that is where those two institutions diverge pretty dramatically.\nAnd President Reagan made a pretty forceful case about how important it was for the Supreme Court to operate with the full complement of justices. Given the significant issues before the Court over the course of the next year, we believe that that's something that the justices of the Supreme Court should have this time, too.\nQ: With these senators saying that we need to wait until the voters have had their say, it would appear we're not going to have a confirmation vote. Would you acknowledge that at this s\nMR. EARNEST: I would not acknowledge that at this stage. Look, Senator McConnell issued a statement shortly after Justice Scalia's death saying that the President should not put forward a nominee because the United States Senate wouldn't consider that person at all. And President Obama, however, has insisted upon fulfilling his constitutional duty.\nSo even though many Republicans didn't want to have conversations with him, the President moved forward and insisted on seeking the advice and consent of members of Congress as he tried to decide who he should put forward for his Supreme Court nominee to fill this vacancy.\nThe President ended up choosing someone that even Republicans described as a consensus nominee. And the President is serious about holding the Senate accountable. And we've seen a number of Democrats come forward -- they've held meetings with Chief Judge Garland. They've come to the same kind of assessment that he is somebody who is prepared to serve his country with honor and distinction on the Supreme Court. He is, after all, somebody who has more federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in history. And we believe that that's part of why he should be confirmed.\nAnd we're going to continue to make that strong case. And Republicans are in a tough spot. Many Republicans started out saying that they wouldn't meet with him in private; they've since had to reverse position and meet with him. And when asked, the best that they can come up with is that the reason that they're not doing their job is because Senator McConnell told them not to.\nAnd I just don't think that's a justification that's going to fly with many voters across the country. And I think that's even true in ruby-red states like Idaho. The people of Idaho I think, when they elected their senator, they expected him to do their job. When they see that their senator is collecting a six-figure annual paycheck, they expect their senator to do their job. And right now, Senator Risch and his colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference aren't.\nQ: Okay. Turning quickly to Russia, the Defense Ministry rejected complaints from the U.S. about planes flying so close to a Navy destroyer in the Baltic. Is this a case where the U.S. and Russia will just agree to disagree? Or can the U.S. actually effect change in Russia's behavior?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me answer that question two ways. The first is that, obviously, the incident is inconsistent with the professional norms of militaries that are operating in proximity to each other in international waters and air space. In fact, there is a bilateral agreement between the United States and Russia that dates back to the Cold War that governs incidents exactly like this. This is what's often referred to as the INCSEA Treaty. It's the bilateral agreement on the prevention of incidents on and over the high seas.\nThis was agreed to back in 1972. There are annual meetings to review the terms of the agreement and each country's compliance with the agreement. But there is one specific passage that refers to incidents just like this. I'll just read part of it: \"Commanders of aircraft of the parties shall use the greatest caution and prudence in approaching aircraft and ships of the other party operating on and over the high seas, in particular ships engaged in launching or landing aircraft, and, in the interest of mutual safety, shall not permit simulated attacks by the simulated use of weapons against aircraft and ships, or performance of various aerobatics over ships, or dropping various objects near them in such a manner as to be hazardous to ships or to constitute a hazard to navigation.\"\nSo this specific incident is pretty specifically contemplated by this agreement. The United States has raised our concerns with the Russians. Fortunately, there's a well-established process for doing so. It's not at all uncommon for Russian military aircraft to engage in acts like this. So we typically would raise concerns about this through the military defense attachй at the U.S. embassy in Moscow.\nI can tell you that that communication has occurred. And we'll seek to resolve our differences through a well-established military channel.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, the China trade announcement that you mentioned at the top of the briefing, do you expect that to change or aid your efforts to get support for TPP in Congress? And do you expect it more broadly to affect the conversation about trade on Capitol Hill and on the campaign trail?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to those who are still making up their mind about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I think for both supporters and those who may be skeptical of the agreement, this should serve as a useful illustration of the priority that the administration places on enforcing trade agreements and enforcing trade rules in a way that benefits U.S. businesses, U.S. workers, and the U.S. economy.\nOur record on this, as I alluded to, is quite strong, both in terms of the U.S. being aggressive about pursuing cases. We have raised these cases frequently, more than any other country. And so far, we're undefeated when it comes to cases that have actually been decided by the WTO. There are several that are still pending. So that's an indication that this administration's track record on looking out for U.S. businesses and U.S. workers is pretty good. It's quite good, in fact. And I think that should give confidence to those who are considering how the TPP was negotiated, and can have confidence that it was negotiated by individuals who know how to protect U.S. interests in the international economy.\nQ: Aside from your, no doubt, position that the U.S. was just right on this, can you offer any insight as to why China changed its mind and decided not to fight this?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I would do is I'd refer you to USTR to talk a little bit more about this particular agreement. As you point out, this is actually China agreeing to settle this case that we had brought to the WTO. But I don't have any details about what may have motivated China. Presumably, it had something to do with the strength of our case.\nQ: And on one other topic, the Ukrainian parliament has approved a new prime minister. What are the prospects now, do you think, for fighting corruption there with this leader?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that they're working to form the full government. And obviously the United States is committed to supporting our partners in Ukraine as they endure a difficult situation. Right now, they're facing some significant economic and fiscal challenges, some of which are being exacerbated by the security challenges that they're facing from Russia, who has repeatedly violated their territorial integrity. So they're going through a difficult time, and they have relied on the United States and other international institutions to support them.\nAnd what we have said is that there are critically important reforms that include reforms related to fighting corruption that are going to be critical to Ukraine's longer-term success. And we're going to continue to encourage Ukraine to implement those reforms and to stay -- to remain conscientious in doing so and following through on them, because it will be critical to their longer-term ability to stabilize and strengthen their economy and prepare them to better weather the kind of interference that they're receiving from the Russians.\nQ: And what's your take on the new prime minister?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't want to render judgment on this individual until the entire cabinet has been appointed here.\nBut obviously we're going to stay in touch with the Ukrainian government, and we're still committed to supporting them through these challenging times.\nMary.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Two years ago today, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 Nigerian school girls; only 57 of them managed to escape. Are we any closer to finding those remaining girls? And how hopeful are you that they can be recovered at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Mary, it is a sad anniversary. And this is an incident -- a tragedy -- that captured that attention of the world. Unfortunately, it's not the only kidnapping incident that we've seen Boko Haram perpetrate in Nigeria. The United States continues to strongly support Nigerian efforts to bring about the safe recovery of all of those who have been kidnapped. We have provided a range of assistance to Nigerian authorities as they've sought to rescue those who have been kidnapped. That assistance includes significant intelligence resources and capabilities that we can offer them. The United States also has provided training and strategic advice to the Nigerian authorities who are conducting the search.\nWe've also played an important role in offering support to victims. One of the challenges that Nigeria has faced is once individuals are actually rescued after having been kidnapped from Boko Haram, how do you treat their psychological needs -- obviously, they've been through an unthinkable situation -- and how do you help them reenter everyday society and begin to get back on their feet again? That would be a daunting challenge even in the United States, let alone a country like Nigeria that is under significant threat from extremists inside their borders.\nSo there are a variety of ways that we have offered assistance, both to the Nigerian government and to the Nigerian people. And we will stand with them as they counter this extremist threat.\nQ: And are you seeing any signs that all of this assistance is making any real dent in the fight against this group? I mean, they're one of the deadliest terror groups in the world. Are you confident that all of this assistance is really helping to tackle this?\nMR. EARNEST: We do feel as if the Nigerian authorities have made progress, both in terms of countering Boko Haram -- there are kidnap victims that have been rescued -- but the threat still remains. And it is quite serious. And it's why the United States continues to be committed to supporting them as they counter that threat.\nQ: And one question on Zika funding. Hal Rogers and other appropriators still feel they want more specifics on the administration's Zika funding request. You've made clear that you feel that Congress has a responsibility to act here, but does the administration also have a responsibility to answer some of their remaining questions, to meet them halfway?\nMR. EARNEST: Absolutely. Look -- exactly -- the administration has put forward legislative language. So it's not as if it's just some vague proposal. There's actually legislative text here that Congress can act on. If they have their own suggestions for things that they would like to do differently, in some cases, they may be contradicting the advice of the foremost public health professionals in the United States, but we're willing to entertain that conversation. We're willing to engage with Congress to see some sort of commitment to actually acting.\nBut look, this was presented to them almost exactly two months ago, and we still haven't seen any legislative activity that includes the kind of funding that our public health experts say that we need. You heard directly from leaders at both the CDC and the NIH stand at this podium earlier this week saying that they don't have what they need right now in order to properly prepare and fully prepare for what could be a pretty serious situation later this summer.\nAnd I think, look, at some point this summer, it's going to happen. This is going to be -- this story, the Zika virus and its spread through mosquitoes and the risk that it poses to pregnant women, is going to be dominating the news. This is going to be leading all your news broadcasts. This is going to be on the front page of newspapers across the country. And I don't know what Republicans are going to say that they did to prepare for it.\nWe did have an opportunity to prepare for it. We did have an opportunity to take steps in advance to protect the American people. Typically, we don't have that kind of opportunity. Typically, it's difficult to prepare for a coming tornado, or a terrorist attack, or a global pandemic of some kind. In this situation -- which is different than those, just to be clear -- but it's still a serious situation, and one for which it is possible for us to make preparation in advance to try to blunt the impact.\nBut Republicans have frittered away that opportunity for reasons I don't think they can fully explain.\nQ: But despite the legislative language, even with that legislative language that you've been holding up, they say they still have concerns. Representatives Cole and Granger have sent letters to HHS and State Department that they say they still have not received responses to. You will go ahead and answer their remaining questions, is what you're saying?\nMR. EARNEST: The administration is certainly committed to engaging in a conversation with members of Congress -- a good-faith conversation -- to make sure that our public health professionals get the funding that they say that they need to protect the American people.\nSo I can't speak to any individual letters that they may have sent, but look, there are pages and pages of legislative language that's been presented in detail to members of Congress months ago to get them to act on Zika funding. And we would welcome their constructive engagement to try to move this forward. The clock is ticking.\nMichelle.\nQ: On the same subject -- I mean, we heard the strong statements coming from the White House repeatedly, we heard some of the pushback from Appropriations and their response to it, with these questions. So I mean, at the risk of this continuing to be an impasse, what is the White House's plan for trying to lower that space that lies between? Are you reaching out to members of Congress that are on the committee? What's your plan for trying to move this forward then?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, Michelle, I think the ball is in Congress's court. The administration has put together a carefully thought-out proposal. We've consulted the foremost public health experts not just in the country, but in the world, to consider the kinds of steps that we need. We've repeatedly consulted with state and local officials about what kind of assistance the federal government can and should provide to local communities who will be on the front lines of fighting this fight.\nOne critical part of our strategy must be trying to control the mosquito population. It is local communities -- typically local governments -- who are responsible for spraying for mosquitos. And if we want to enhance their ability to cover a broader geographic area, or to intensify their efforts around certain communities, and to be able to do so on short notice, then we need to provide them additional resources. And that's exactly what we're suggesting that we should do.\nI don't understand how Republicans could quibble with that. There's nothing ideological about that. And this is the other irony of this situation -- we know that the situation is likely to be worse in states like Georgia and Florida and Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana and Texas because they have a climate that's more conducive to the spread of mosquitos. Many of those states are represented in Congress by more Republicans than Democrats. So there's no reason this should be partisan. There's not even a reason that we should have a regional difference here. This is just a matter of doing your job. And this is another very good example of Republicans refusing to do so without a legitimate explanation. And it's one that people are not paying as much attention to right now, but I guarantee you that's going to change.\nQ: That's exactly what I'm saying, though. I mean, you stood up here and said it's been months. You seem to have zero confidence that anything will move on it. So at this point, is the White House planning to do some reach-out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there have been conversations, including at the presidential level, on this topic. And I am actually hopeful that Congress will take seriously the need to act here. Again, there's no good explanation for them not to. There's not a political difference about a Zika diagnosis. We have a pretty significant political difference over the Supreme Court, for example.\nNow, it's unfortunate that Republicans have reduced themselves to letting politics interfere so badly in the Supreme Court process. Republicans have acknowledged that the reason that they're not acting is because the Republican leader of the Senate told them not to, and because they don't want to, as Senator Cornyn described, confirm another \"Obama judge.\" That's not what the Supreme Court has in mind. I mean, that's not what the Constitution has in mind for the Supreme Court. And we can have that argument we have, and I don't think Republicans are winning it.\nBut when it comes to Zika, there should be no reason for a political partisan difference here. This is just a matter of governing. And I do think Republicans are struggling to demonstrate to the American public that they can handle the responsibility of governing the country.\nQ: And on the Nigerian girls, is the President aware of that video that came out this week showing them being interviewed by what appears to be a member of Boko Haram?\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously there's been extensive news coverage of the video. I don't know that the President has been briefed on it specifically, but I would imagine that he is aware of it.\nQ: And in some of the reporting that's been done, it seems evident that there are conversations going on, negotiations between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram over the girls. To what extent is the U.S. involved in that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is obviously -- the effort to recover those who have been kidnapped in Nigeria is an effort that's being led by the Nigerian government. The role of the United States has been to support that effort, and there are a variety of ways that we can support it, including by sharing intelligence, offering military advice, and even offering some assistance to those who are recovering from the trauma of being kidnapped. So there's an important role for the United States to play, but this is an effort that is led by Nigerian authorities, as it should be.\nQ: But what was the U.S.'s involvement from the beginning? What can you say about those negotiations? Can you confirm that they are going on? And at what state would you say they are right now?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a sense of where those negotiations stand right now. I'd encourage you to consult with the Nigerian government about that.\nQ: And speaking of partisan differences they were just talking about on Garland, because these meetings have been going on, and because it seems like no minds have been changed from where they originally were, can you really call that progress?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think minds have been changed as it relates to the notion of having private meetings. Senator Toomey is a classic example. He's somebody who, at first, ruled out a private meeting with Chief Judge Garland and --\nQ: But why does that matter? Because if the ultimate end is that no minds are changed on the original stance --\nMR. EARNEST: I guess what I'm trying to illustrate is, his original stance was that he's not going to do a meeting with Chief Judge Garland, and then he agreed to have a private meeting with Chief Judge Garland. So if his mind changed on having a private meeting then the potential exists that his mind might change on other aspects of this argument that he and his Republican colleagues are struggling to make.\nAgain, they're in a tough position. Senator Toomey, in particular. I just don't think there are that many Pennsylvanians who are sympathetic to the argument that Senator Toomey shouldn't do his job just because the Republican leader in the Senate said he shouldn't. I think the people of Pennsylvania expect that as long as their senator is cashing his paychecks that he should be doing his job and fulfilling his constitutional responsibilities.\nAnd I think the other question that the people of Pennsylvania have for Senator Toomey is one that relates directly to why he felt the need to meet with Chief Judge Garland in private. He walked out of that private meeting saying that he's got concerns. Well, why wouldn't he give -- if he's got concerns, then it surely seems to me that the way he can get out of this political box that he's in is to say, well, let's have public hearings. I'm going to raise my concerns in public with Chief Judge Garland, and if he's so confident that people will agree with his concerns then why wouldn't he want all that to be made public?\nI would actually posit that's precisely the reason that Republicans oppose having meetings, because Republicans don't want to give Chief Judge Garland an opportunity to make his case in public about why he deserves a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. The reason for that is I think that they know that he'll make a good presentation and that he will be effective in making the case to the American public that he deserves this opportunity, or at least that he can fulfill the vacancy on the Supreme Court with honor and distinction. And that's what Republicans are up to. And it's unfortunate that they've allowed politics to intrude as much as they have.\nQ: A couple of weeks ago, we heard from Denis McDonough saying that he is confident that he actually will be confirmed. But with the time that has passed and what has been said on the subject, do you still feel that way?\nMR. EARNEST: I feel that way. I absolutely feel that way. And again --\nQ: -- that this is going to go through the process and that he will make it to the Supreme Court?\nMR. EARNEST: That's exactly why we're going through this exercise. This is what the Founding Fathers envisioned. This is the way the process has worked for every Supreme Court nominee, dating back to 1875. Every time a President has put forward a nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court since 1875 that individual has received a hearing and/or a vote. That's what we would expect to occur this time.\nAnd, look, Republicans are making a political argument for why that shouldn't happen. But the problem is the politics are not on their side. The politics for them are tough, even among Republicans. There's ample polling data out there to indicate that Republican voters across the country don't agree with the position that the Republican senators are taking.\nAnd I think a lot of those voters view this in the same way that President Obama does, which is -- you heard him make this case to Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday over the weekend, where the President said that if Republicans follow through on this threat to refuse to do their job, to refuse to consider Chief Judge Garland's nomination even though they describe him as a consensus nominee, what's to stop Democrats who are in charge of the Senate when a Republican is in office from saying, well, we're just going to wait four years to fill the vacancy. There's no material difference in that argument. That would represent a breakdown of the process.\nQ: Would they do that? I mean, you're saying that it seems like -- that they would do that.\nMR. EARNEST: They would be justified in doing it based on what Republicans have done so far. Hopefully, it won't come to that. Hopefully, Republicans will do what every Senate has done since 1875, which is give a hearing and/or a vote to every Supreme Court nominee that's been put forward to fill a vacancy.\nQ: So if you believe that this is going to happen and no minds have changed even after the private meeting with Garland, what do you think is going to happen between now and the time that he is confirmed? Is it going to be public pressure? I mean, what's going to end up changing those minds, if you think that this will go through?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm loath to predict exactly what's going to change Republican minds. I think it's hard to -- because, frankly, it's hard to know what they're thinking. They're not making an argument that is getting them a lot of traction politically. They're not really enhancing anybody's confidence in their ability to handle the basic function of governing the greatest country in the world. And they're setting up a scenario that could hamstring Republican Presidents in the future.\nSo it's hard to know exactly what they're thinking. Right now, I think what we will do is we're going to continue to make our case, and we're going to continue to act as the Constitution has outlined. And we're going to continue to make the case that Chief Judge Garland should get what every Supreme Court nominee since 1875 has gotten, which is both a hearing and a vote.\nI'll say that the next step in this process would be following through on a questionnaire. And I know this is something that came up at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing today. And I know this is something that Senator Grassley's office has previously confirmed that they would expect to happen. So I would anticipate that that will likely be sort of the next milestone in this process.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, can you offer any details of the contents of the defense attachй's message to Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the details of that message. I don't know exactly how that information is transmitted. What I do know, though, is that that is a routine channel of communication; that the defense attachй in Moscow is responsible for communicating with his counterparts there on a regular basis on a wide range of issues.\nAnd it is not uncommon at all to use this channel to raise our concerns about this kind of conduct from the Russian military. We've seen this kind of -- these kinds of acts from Russian military pilots, for example, in the past. This is the channel that we have used to convey our concerns. So it is not at all extraordinary that we would be conveying our concerns about this incident through that particular channel.\nQ: But the incidents themselves on Monday and Tuesday were not routine. I notice in the video or photos like that of Russian aircraft buzzing a United States warship -- by using the defense attachй channel, is it an effort to lower the heat of the incident, not going through a defense minister or foreign minister or head of state?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I do think that there's little value in further escalating the situation. What I understand to be true is that the incident that we saw is not routine, but certainly not unprecedented. There have been a number of other reports that we've even discussed in here where Russian military pilots have operated in a manner that's inconsistent with the generally accepted norms of international airspace and international waters.\nSo this is the most effective channel and the most commonly used channel for raising those concerns.\nQ: Does the United States believe that Russia violated the Incidents at Sea agreement?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is clear, based on the information that I read to you, is that the conduct of the Russian military pilots in this particular incident is inconsistent with that agreement. And that's why we would raise those concerns through our defense attachй.\nQ: So no plans for the President to call President Putin?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly wouldn't rule out presidential conversations, but at this point, if a phone call were to take place, it would not be a direct response to this particular incident. The President consults with President Putin on a range of issues, including the ongoing situation in Ukraine. But we'll obviously keep you posted if there are any presidential phone calls that are scheduled.\nQ: Do you have any reaction from President Obama on the incident itself?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to him about it directly.\nQ: On your list?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I'll add it to my list. (Laughter.)\nQ: Follow on Mark with that?\nMR. EARNEST: Sure, Bill, go ahead.\nQ: What would be the U.S. reaction if the Russians were to undertake a similar exercise in international waters but, say, near Alaska?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess it's hard to contemplate exactly that hypothetical scenario.\nQ: They're right there.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, they're right there, but --\nQ: You can see them from backyards. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I think I've heard that before. Look, at this point, I wouldn't get into the hypotheticals here. I think that what occurred is inconsistent with our international agreements with Russia. It is, unfortunately, not unprecedented, and -- however, we do have an established channel for raising our concerns about this incident, and those concerns have been raised. And I'm sure the message has been faithfully received by our Russian counterparts.\nRon.\nQ: How unprecedented is it not? In other parts of the world, in the Baltic, or --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense for more incidents like this. But it's not uncommon for me to discuss even these kinds of incidents here at the podium.\nSo it certainly is inconsistent with our expectations about the way pilots should conduct themselves in international airspace and over international waters. But it's not unprecedented.\nQ: And when objections have been raised, what's the response been?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it varies by the situation. And obviously, we've got an opportunity to raise it through this channel. And there are annual meetings to discuss the INCSEA, this international agreement, and that would also be a venue for us to raise these kinds of concerns as well.\nQ: One thing struck me about watching the video -- the U.S. sailors don't appear to take a defensive position of any sort. They don't seem to be moving towards weapons -- did you notice that, and did that strike you as a -- this is obviously -- this is a serious incident, but it didn't appear that they were trying to defend themselves in any way.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't speak to the standard procedure for responding to these kinds of incidents. The Department of Defense may be able to give you a better sense of the reaction and -- by the sailors that were onboard the ship. And they can also give you a sense of what would be the routine, standard reaction in a situation like that.\nQ: It just didn't seem consistent with the level of alarm or alert or concern that's being raised. I mean, not to --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know. We certainly are concerned about the incident, but I don't think that I've suggested any sort of alarm. I think civilians watching the video may have been alarmed, but I think we've acknowledged that this is the kind of behavior that we see from the Russians periodically. And we have our well-established channels to raise our concerns about it and try to get it resolved.\nQ: On your list, as it were, the 28-page 9/11 report -- you've said in the past couple days that you never asked the President about whether he has read or requested to read those pages. Have you since gotten around to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to him about it.\nQ: Do you intend to, or is there some reason you haven't?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll see if I can get some more information about it. It just hasn't been on the list of things that I've talked to him about.\nQ: So at this point, we don't know that he's read these -- or requested this or not? We don't know?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we do know that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is conducting a process to consider those 28 pages for declassification. That is part of their standard procedure. They've also indicated their desire to try to resolve that process before the end of the year. But that's something that they're still working on and they can give you an update. And I guess in some ways that's why -- well, they can give you more details on that process.\nQ: And on the Boko Haram tape and the situation two years later now, is there any information that the United States government, military, has developed about the situation? You said that it's a Nigerian issue, as obviously -- is there any information that the United States has about the condition of any of these girls? Is there any indication of what their conditions are? Have they been freed? Anything more other than essentially it's something that the Nigerians are dealing with?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously there are significant intelligence capabilities that the United States has and has devoted to the effort to counter Boko Haram and to try to rescue Nigerians who have been kidnapped by them. Unfortunately, Boko Haram's tactic of kidnapping innocent civilians extends far beyond just the hundreds of girls who were kidnapped from Chibok. And that's a tragedy.\nAnd we have devoted our intelligence resources to assisting the Nigerian authorities who are trying to rescue those people. And those intelligence capabilities have been helpful. They have been useful in the rescue and recovery of innocent Nigerian civilians that have been kidnapped. But beyond that, I don't have a whole lot more to say about our intelligence activities right now.\nQ: You've helped plead their case? There are others -- maybe not the details, but you're saying there are other situations where American intelligence has led to the release or freedom of --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. I mean, unfortunately, there have been thousands of people in Nigeria that have been kidnapped. And it's a tragic situation. And this is a inhumane, immoral tactic that we've seen Boko Haram use. Government authorities have succeeded in some cases in driving out Boko Haram, in some cases rescuing civilians or making it possible for civilians to escape from captivity. All this is good news, and the United States has played a helpful, constructive role in all of that. But ultimately, this is a Nigerian-led effort. They are the ones who deserve credit for those successes. But they are also the individuals who are chiefly responsible for continuing the fight.\nQ: Just one thing on the Russian plane -- did this latest incident, was this an escalation? Was this the most serious? Or have there been incidents like this that have been more serious that we haven't seen on videotape or that we've not been aware of? Can you just kind of put this into some context?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it is fair to say that this particular incident has gotten more attention than it otherwise would primarily because of how that video of the incident has become public. Again, my understanding is that while incidents like this are not routine and don't commonly occur, they do periodically happen when it comes to the Russians. And fortunately, we have a channel for expressing our concerns about these kinds of incidents. We have an agreement that covers these kinds of engagements. And the next time that there's a meeting to discuss that treaty, I'm confident that incidents like this will be discussed as well.\nQ: And the Russians said essentially -- I don't have the quote in front of me -- that they don't understand the American response. They don't -- this incident happened near a Russian base, and what's the big problem? What's your response to the Russian response?\nMR. EARNEST: These were international waters. Our forces were operating in international waters. Those Russian military aircraft were operating in international airspace. And the way that they operated those aircraft is inconsistent with the international agreement we have with the Russians about how to operate aircraft in international airspace.\nSo, in some cases, this is a pretty cut-and-dried situation. We've raised our concerns, and I'm confident that the Russians are well aware of them.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Just to follow up for just a second on the fly-by, because of the distance from the aircraft to the vessel, would you acknowledge that it would be possible to essentially dive-bomb that vessel with an aircraft? So once shot down -- they're flying at a high rate of speed. Would the Americans be justified in taking down that aircraft?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'm not able to discuss or describe to you the rules of engagement in a situation like that. But the Department of the Navy I'm sure would be happy to give you a better sense of what our expectations are for the actions that our sailors need to take in international waters in order to protect themselves.\nQ: Specifically to the video, which you've seen and I imagine the President has as well, would it be his position that if they chose to engage that aircraft they would have been justified?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think in this case, the President wouldn't -- even in the hypothetical -- wouldn't second-guess their actions. There is a procedure in place. It's not one that I can describe, but there are obviously rules that we would expect our sailors to follow. Unfortunately, in this case it appears that it's the Russian military pilots that are operating inconsistent with the agreed-upon rules between Russia and the United States. And that's why we raised concerns with Russian authorities.\nQ: Russian President Putin had his annual call-in show, some three-plus hours of Q&A with the Russian people. During the conversation, he mentioned the President's remarks to Chris Wallace of Fox News in an acknowledgement that his biggest mistake or regret during his presidency was not having a plan post Qaddafi in Libya -- about which Vladimir Putin said that they were very nearly going to have a similar situation in Syria if they were to have deposed the Assad regime. But fortunately, he felt like, Russia and the U.S. have been able to work together, collaboratively, to deescalate events on the ground there. Do you support what the Russian President is saying about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, one part that's unclear -- I didn't see as much of it as you've described -- I'm not aware that the United States came particularly close to a scenario in which the United States was prepared to remove President Assad from power using military force. That's certainly not something the President has ever advocated. And so when he says we came close, I think that part is just factually wrong.\nMore broadly, I think the President, in the midst of dealing with a very difficult situation in Syria, has been very conscious of considering carefully the long-term consequences of every decision that is made with regard to Syria. In some ways, that is what led the President to ordering military action against Syria. The President was mindful of the fact -- against ISIL in Syria. The President was mindful of the risk of allowing an extremist organization to establish a safe haven somewhere. The President was mindful of the long-term consequences of allowing an extremist organization to carry out an act of genocide. For both of those reasons, the President ordered military action against ISIL targets both in Syria and Iraq. So he was mindful of those long-term consequences when ordering military action.\nAt the same time, the President has also been mindful of the long-term consequences of a large-scale ground combat deployment of U.S. military resources in Syria. He recognizes that that would not be in the interest of the United States either. And so what the President has sought to do is to ensure that we are taking the necessary steps to protect the American people from ISIL, without trying to impose a military solution on the chaos in Syria that would draw the United States back into a Middle Eastern ground war. That's the kind of quagmire that the President has sought to avoid. And so far, we have been successful in doing that.\nQ: Then it would be a respectful disagreement with former Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno, who yesterday said he thought it might take about 50,000 ground troops to really eradicate ISIS, maybe led by the U.S. but not involving solely American forces. Is that something that the administration would disagree with?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I didn't see his comments. I think what we have long acknowledged is that a ground force of some kind would be required to completely root out ISIL. And that is why the United States has invested significantly in building the capacity of Iraqi forces to take the fight to ISIL in Iraq. And we've worked hard to build a Syrian-Arab coalition inside of Syria that has made progress in taking back territory from ISIL fighters. And we're going to continue to support that fighting force and continue to encourage them to take the fight to ISIL. They've made some important progress, but there's a lot of work left to be done.\nQ: Last one -- on Zika. You mentioned earlier that the -- I imagine you know this -- the administration has received letters from Congress asking for more information about the threat posed by Zika -- to OMB, to the State Department, also to HHS. Are you aware of these letters? And has the administration responded back to Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the individual letters. But on February 22nd, we sent them legislative language that Congress has not acted on.\nQ: I have the letters here. I could forward them to you. And they're specifically to the Director of HHS, specifically to Secretary Kerry, specifically to the Director of OMB.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, maybe we can engage in a little information exchange. I'm happy to give you a copy of our legislation. If you want to pass that on to members of Congress and get them to act on it, then maybe we'll see if --\nQ: They came on March 7th. March 7th they're asking for specific information about how the money would be spent. Now, the Speaker's office has helpfully mailed them to us during the briefing.\nQ: He said he wrote the letter, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, that's great. (Laughter.) Somebody on my staff maybe should send them -- maybe they missed the memo. Maybe they were sick on February 22nd --\nQ: -- asking for specific information about how the money would be spent.\nMR. EARNEST: I guess I find it hard to believe. We will provide this letter to all of you, just so that you all can consider it. Maybe you could answer the questions for them. I don't know if it means that they haven't looked at the specific proposal. But this is not like a factsheet. This isn't just like a specific chart with some numbers. This actually includes a detailed analysis of exactly how the money would be spent. And again, this includes legislative language that, for two months now, Congress has refused to act on. And you heard from our public health professionals who stood up here and said that this is what they need to fight Zika. This is what they need to fight Zika.\nSo we're happy to answer their questions. But I think the American people would certainly appreciate Republicans in Congress demonstrating that they're prepared to govern the country and demonstrating that they're prepared to do what is necessary to protect the American people from Zika. And they can hide behind a bunch of bureaucratic letters, or they can actually do the job that's necessary to protect the American people. I hope they'll choose the responsible path.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, back to the Supreme Court and Garland. You said a little while ago that Democrats would be justified in refusing to act on a future Republican President's nominee for four years. Aren't you escalating things here? Is that an actual threat to escalate if Republicans win?\nMR. EARNEST: I have no standing to make that threat. I do not intend at any point to work in the United States Senate. So there will be future Democrats who will have to make that decision.\nQ: You said they'd be justified in doing so.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what Republicans have done is they've made an argument saying, we're not going to do our job, we're not going to do what the Constitution says; we're going to wait until the next President gets in office to make a decision, and we're basing that argument on the fact that the President who's currently in office is not in our party.\nThat is exactly the same case that Democrats would be making, and that's why I think they'd be justified in making it. I wouldn't recommend that they do. I'm confident in telling you that if Senator Obama were still in office, that he wouldn't support that approach. But Democrats would be making the same argument that Republicans are making right now, and that's why I think it would be hard for Republicans to rebut it, because Democrats would be making the same argument. It's not one that I support. It's certainly not one that President Obama supports. But it's one that is consistent with what Republicans have said.\nI think what is true, Mark, is that Republicans are the ones that have escalated. Republicans are the ones who are prepared to deny a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote for the first time since 1875. That's an escalation. It's Republicans who have indicated that they don't actually have any substantive concerns with somebody that they've previously described as a consensus nominee. They're just concerned that it happens to be a Democratic President who's appointed him.\nSo that's the nature of our case.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks. I wanted to ask about the President's upcoming trip to London. It's coming just a couple of months before this important vote on the Brexit. Do you expect the President to meet with London's Mayor, Boris Johnson, who is in --\nQ: Former.\nQ: Well, former mayor -- thank you -- who is a vocal opponent for remaining in the EU for the UK?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware of any former mayors who are on the President's itinerary for this trip. But if he does, we'll let you know.\nQ: And given the fact that the vote is just a couple of months away, can you say if Prime Minister Cameron specifically asked the President to come, or why the President is deciding to sort of step into such a contentious issue so close to a vote?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President is going to go because the United States and the United Kingdom have a special relationship, and the President has traveled frequently to the U.K. to cement that relationship and to further deepen our cooperation on a wide range of issues.\nAnd so I would anticipate that while in London, the President will have an opportunity to talk to Prime Minister Cameron about issues like our counter-ISIL campaign, our ongoing efforts to protect both British and American citizens from terrorism. I'm confident there will be a discussion of the global economy and a range of other issues.\nSo at the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if this ongoing political debate in the UK comes up. But the President, when he travels to the UK, will have a pretty long agenda.\nQ: I wanted to circle back to the $10 bill issue from yesterday. I know you said that this is something that's housed in Treasury, but I'm wondering if the President is specifically engaged on this, especially since there's been sort of this uproar about Hamilton and the backlash against the idea of taking him -- or changing the way he's depicted on the $10 bill. Is the President specifically engaged, and does he want to have a say on how this plays out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think the President understands that this is a responsibility of the Secretary of the Treasury to make decisions about the currency like this. I don't have any confidential conversations between the President and his Treasury Secretary to tell you about, but the President certainly does have confidence in Secretary Lew to make a decision that reflects the President's views.\nQ: And then one more on encryption. The White House announced the members of the Commission on Enhancing National Security yesterday. Part of their role is to --\nQ: Cybersecurity.\nQ: Thank you -- Cybersecurity -- yesterday. And part of their role is to make sure that cybersecurity is enhanced both in the public and private sector. So I'm wondering if their role -- include divulging how the FBI got into the San Bernardino iPhone, showing Apple what that flaw was so that Apple could close that gap for the future.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the mission of the CNAP -- this is the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity. This is a commission that will be focused on cybersecurity issues, and they are responsible for drafting a series of recommendations about steps that the United States should take over the course of the next 10 years to bolster our cybersecurity. They're prepared to present that report before the end of this year. The President certainly is looking forward to reviewing that report and is hopeful that we'll be able to hand off this strategy to the next administration for them to implement in a way that would enhance our national security and our cybersecurity.\nIssues related to encryption will not be considered by the commission.\nQ: But specifically on that broader question, on whether the government or the FBI has decided whether or not to tell Apple how it ended up getting into the phone so that -- apparently there is a flaw in the system -- so that if Apple wants to close that flaw, is that something the government is prepared to do?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, there is a well-established process for considering questions like this. This was laid out in 2014, that there would essentially be an interagency process led by the White House for considering these questions.\nBut I would point out that that process for considering those questions only applies when the U.S. government is in possession of a particular vulnerability. And the Department of Justice and the FBI have not indicated that they're in possession of that vulnerability. They've indicated that they are in possession of a tool that allowed them to exploit a particular vulnerability and get access to the material that they were looking for on the San Bernardino terrorist's iPhone.\nBut, again, this process applies to situations in which the government is in possession of a vulnerability. And neither the Department of Justice, nor the FBI has said affirmatively that they are in possession of the vulnerability. For more questions about that, you should go check with them.\nQ: Okay. And then just one more. Has the President specifically been briefed on the Senate bill to deal with encryption? And does the White House have a position on that bill, any concerns about it?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not the President has been briefed on it. We've indicated previously that the administration is willing to work with Congress on these issues and was prepared, and actually did work with the members of the United States Senate who were drafting this particular legislation.\nAs you've heard me say on a number of occasions, the prospects for a constructive bill actually passing the Congress are rather dim. And that is not a judgment of the good-faith efforts of members of -- individual members of Congress who understand that this should be a priority. It, rather, is a reflection of the extreme dysfunction that the Republican leadership has brought to both houses of Congress.\nLesley.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Carnival Cruise Lines down in Miami is being sued by some folks for allegedly denying Cuban-born Americans the ability to go to Cuba when it resumes cruises there, voyages there, May 1st. Cuban law prohibits Cuban nationals from returning by sea. They can fly there, but not by sea. Is that something that the White House was aware of when it began negotiations with the government about making some changes?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not this came up in our conversations with the Cuban government. Obviously we have tried to work effectively with the Cuban government to begin to normalize relations between our two countries, including removing some of the obstacles that have limited travel by citizens of our two countries. But I can't speak to this particular issue. Let me see if I can get some more information about this particular issue and see if we can help you understand our position a little bit better.\nQ: Treasury, a year ago, in an unrelated, but they're saying it's a similar situation, told Kuwaiti Airlines that it was going to have to end some discriminatory practices involved with the country it was heading to, not the actual carrier itself. Is that idea of discriminatory practices something that the concerns the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not sure whether or not that would apply in this particular case. But let me see if I can get some more information about this particular case and see if we can better answer that specific question.\nJohn, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two quick housekeeping matters. I had an interview yesterday with Mr. Newton Minow of Chicago, who formerly was in the same law firm with the President and the First Lady. It was his understanding that the President will remain in the Washington, D.C. area after he leaves office, presumably while his daughters finish school, but he hoped in a few years he'd move back to Chicago. Has the President made any short-term or long-term residency plans for after he leaves office next year?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has indicated in the last couple of months that he and the First Lady do intend to remain in Washington while their youngest daughter completes high school. But beyond that, I don't know that any specific decisions have been made.\nQ: Chicago on the list?\nMR. EARNEST: I certainly wouldn't rule it out. I think the President's affection for his hometown is well-known.\nQ: The other thing is last week, you cited to me some quotes from world leaders about their concerns about some of the comments by Donald Trump in the campaign. You quoted the President and former President of Mexico, and other world leaders. Tell me something. The talk about a wall that Mr. Trump continues -- could you say that this has led to a deterioration of U.S. relations with Mexico, Central and Latin America?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it does not -- again, based solely on those public comments, it does not appear that the Mexican government thinks very highly of that policy. But in terms of our ability to continue to coordinate effectively to advance the economic and security interests of the United States, it has not been affected. We still have important relationships there.\nI'll tell you one thing that has been affected is that the Senate has been rather slow in confirming the President's eminently well-qualified ambassador to Mexico. And we've certainly been disappointed to see that process be bogged down by Republicans in the Senate. But as it relates to those specific comments, I guess it's fair to say that they haven't helped.\nSo, John Bennett, I promised to call on you and I failed to do that earlier. So I'll let you do that.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Speaker Ryan's office says that the Zika proposal you guys sent over was merely an outline, that it lacked the usual budget justification documents. And yesterday, Chairman Rogers said he's ordered his staff to begin writing the Zika funding bill. So even if you question their motives, they're asking for information. Chairman Rogers is writing a bill. Has the President reached out to Chairman Rogers? Has anyone reached out to Chairman Rogers from here, given your urgency and what you said about the threat?\nMR. EARNEST: The answer to that question is, yes. I don't have any specific conversations to tell you about. But we'll pass out this document and I think that the detail that's included in here will make clear exactly the serious nature of the proposal.\nI will tell you that I am recently informed that the letters that the Speaker's office has apparently distributed to all of you was responded to by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Shaun Donovan, on April 6th. This was a detailed, four-page response. And since you guys have seen the letters written by members of Congress, I don't really know how constructive it will be, but we'll send you the letter that was written by the administration in response.\nQ: Why don't we have it now -- in an email or --\nMR. EARNEST: That's what I'm suggesting that we'll do, is we'll provide you the letter. I don't think any of that, however, is going to change the basic fact of the case. The President made clear the first week in February that additional funding was going to be necessary. In a couple of weeks, his administration, his Office of Management and Budget, put together a detailed proposal that was sent to Capitol Hill, that was sent to the Speaker of the House and others, laying out precisely what was needed.\nSince that time, we have not seen any funding appropriated by Congress, and we've had public health experts in the United States say that they don't have everything that they need to protect the American people from a significant public health situation. And rather than writing letters, we would appreciate Republicans actually doing their job and passing legislation that has nothing to do with politics, but has everything to do with looking out for those in the United States that could be vulnerable to the Zika virus.\nJohn, anything else?\nQ: One about the President's trip. Democratic Senator Murphy has raised concerns about Saudi Arabia's military operations in Yemen. He believes too many civilians are dying as a result. They're not doing enough to limit civilian casualties. That's something that President talks a lot about with regard to U.S. military operations. Is that something he plans to bring up during his visit?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that the United States has on a number of occasions expressed our own concerns about innocent civilians who have been killed in the ongoing conflict in Yemen.\nOne ray of good news is that the Saudi-led coalition has indicated that they're prepared to observe a ceasefire that would take place in the coming days. We'll obviously have to see whether or not that ceasefire takes hold. Obviously the chief goal of implementing a ceasefire like that would be to expedite the provision of humanitarian assistance that's badly needed in a place like Yemen. So we obviously would be monitoring that situation as well, monitoring how quickly those relief supplies could reach those civilian populations that are in pretty desperate need of that.\nBut what I will say is that the Saudis are justifiably concerned by the instability in Yemen. This is a country with whom they share a long border. And I know that the Saudis and some of their allies in the region have been -- let me say it this way -- some of Saudi Arabia's allies in the region have been responsive to Saudi Arabia's concerns and supported them in the effort to try to address those security concerns.\nIt is the view of the United States that the most effective way to address those security concerns is to resolve the political conflict that's at the center of all of this. There's a U.N.-led process that's trying to bring about a political resolution. The United States is strongly supportive of that process. And I do understand that there are additional meetings that will move that process along and that are scheduled for as early as next week, I believe. But we can get you a more detailed update on that.\nThanks a lot, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow. And we'll get you that letter shortly.\nEND 2:17 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117081", "text": "Via Conference Call\n2:22 P.M. EDT\nMR. STROH: Good afternoon, everybody. And thanks for joining us for our call to preview the President's travel next week to Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Speaking with us today on the record are Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications; Rob Malley, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor to the President for Counter-ISIL, and White House Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa; and Charles Kupchan, the Special Assistant and Senior Director for European Affairs.\nI'll turn it over to Ben momentarily, and then we'll hear from Ben, Rob and Charles. But before I do that, I would just remind folks that this call is on the record, but it will be embargoed until the conclusion of the call.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Ben.\nMR. RHODES: Thanks, Mark. So I'll just start by giving an overview of the current schedule for the President. I'd just note that this trip, as a general matter, allows us to address some of the most important national security challenges that we're currently facing.\nThe President will be meeting with some of our key allies and partners in the world in both the Gulf and in Europe. And so it's a very important chance for him to coordinate our approaches on issues ranging from the counter-ISIL campaign to efforts to promote regional stability in the Middle East, to our support for Ukraine and its sovereignty and territorial integrity, to efforts to promote global economic growth. So this will have a broad agenda and a very consequential series of engagements in the Gulf and Europe.\nThe President will begin by going to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, April 20th. This will be a summit between the United States and the Gulf nations, following up on the summit that we had last year, the first of its kind at the head-of-state level at Camp David. The President will begin on Wednesday afternoon by having a bilateral meeting with King Salman of Saudi Arabia. Then the following day, on Thursday, April 21st, he will have the summit with the GCC leaders, and that summit will be broken into three different sessions -- one on regional stability, one on defeating ISIL and al Qaeda and our counterterrorism cooperation, and then one on Iran and regional security and our efforts to prevent destabilizing actions across the region.\nThat would conclude the GCC summit. And after statements to the press and the press availability, the President will fly that night to the United Kingdom.\nOn Friday, April 22nd, the President will have a lunch with Queen Elizabeth. This visit coincides with her 90th birthday. The President has very much enjoyed his engagements with the Queen over the years. As a general matter, he felt that in his final year in office it would be very important for him to visit our close ally, the United Kingdom, given our special relationship and all the work that we do together around the world. So part of that, of course, involves our longstanding relationship with the Queen. And so he'll have the chance to have lunch with her at Windsor Castle.\nFollowing the lunch with the Queen, the President will have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Cameron. Obviously, we work very closely with the United Kingdom on a host of issues around the world to include the counter-ISIL campaign, counterterrorism efforts, our efforts together in Afghanistan, our efforts, again, to respond to Russian aggression in Ukraine, and our collaboration in terms of promoting global economic growth. So a broad agenda to discuss with Prime Minister Cameron. That meeting will be followed, of course, by a joint press conference.\nThen on Saturday morning, the President will have a town hall meeting with young people, as he's done in many different countries around the world, at Lindley Hall in London, where he'll have the chance to talk about the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom, the agenda that we share together, and the world, and his vision for the future of the cooperation between our two countries.\nAgain, the rest of his schedule is not fully completed in London, so it's likely that we'll have additional elements. But right now, I'd just stress the town hall on that Saturday. And again, we'd expect he'll have additional things that he'll be doing in the afternoon, and we'll keep you posted as that develops.\nOn Sunday, he will be in Hannover, Germany, for the Hannover Messe. Again, as with the trip to the United Kingdom, the President felt it was very important that he has the opportunity to go to Germany in his final year in office. Chancellor Angela Merkel has been a close partner for his entire time in office, and we are working together with Germany on a host of issues, including our commercial ties and the economic collaboration that is represented by the Hannover Messe.\nThe President will have, on that Sunday, a bilateral meeting with Chancellor Merkel, and the two leaders will have a press conference then. The President and Chancellor Merkel will open the Hannover trade show that evening. They'll each be making remarks as a part of that program. And then that night, we expect that the President and Chancellor Merkel will both have an opportunity to have dinner together with a group of American and German business leaders.\nOn Monday, April 25th, the President and Chancellor Merkel will have an opportunity in the morning to tour the trade show on the Hannover Messe fairgrounds to see some of the work that's being done and displayed in Hannover.\nThen, after that tour, the President will deliver a speech. This speech allows him to step back at a time when the United States and Europe, together, are dealing with a range of challenges, from counter-ISIL and the threat of terrorism, to the current refugee crisis and our efforts to address both the humanitarian aspects and the migratory aspects of that crisis, to our shared commitment to Ukraine and its sovereignty and territorial integrity, to our shared efforts to combat the headwinds in the global economy and promote sustainable growth.\nSo the President, again, in Germany will have a chance to address the challenges facing our democracies in the United States and Europe, have a chance to look at the range of different issues confronting our countries, but also review what we've done over the course of the last seven and a half years of his presidency and look ahead to what we need to be doing going forward.\nSo those are the main elements that we currently have scheduled. Like I said, I suspect that there will be additional elements that we'll be adding to this in the coming days, and we'll keep you posted on those.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Rob to give an overview of the GCC Summit.\nMR. MALLEY: As Ben said, this builds from the last GCC-U.S. Summit, which took place about a year ago. It's an idea that the President had to discuss with his GCC counterparts about whether we could have regular meetings. It wouldn't be a one-off event, and it wouldn't be a meeting for the sake of a meeting, but to launch a process in order to deepen the partnership between the United States and GCC countries. And as you see, it's the second iteration. This is going to be a hopefully regular process that will take place every year between the U.S. and the GCC at the leaders level.\nAt the time, what had been discussed a year ago was how could we deepen our partnership on security issues to make sure that the GCC countries are in a better position to fight against the threat of terrorism, to counter Iran's destabilizing activities and, more broadly, to be in a position to shore up their security; and second, how we could work together more effectively to deal with the regional conflicts that were tearing the region apart.\nOne year out, I think if you look back at all the work that's been done on both fronts, I think there's been real progress, and that's what the leaders are going to want to discuss -- review what's been done and what more can be achieved in the coming year.\nOn the security front and security cooperation in terms of what's occurred, over the last 12 months I think there have been countless meetings at all levels, from working groups with Secretary Kerry and Secretary Carter. Secretary Carter will be meeting with his counterparts just on the eve, the day before this summit. And the President himself has been deeply engaged.\nAnd I think as we'll review those and as you'll hear more coming out of the summit, there's been agreements reached to increase our cooperation on counterterrorism, streamlining the transfer of critical defense capabilities to our GCC partners, bolstering the GCC's ballistic defense missile defense system, and defending against the cyber threats. And on all of those I think you'll see progress has been made. There's been much deeper cooperation between us and the GCC. And as I said, Secretary Carter will review all of this with his counterparts on April 20th, and I think you'll hear more about it on that occasion.\nThe second big issue that has been discussed -- that we discussed a year ago and where we see progress over the last year, thanks in no small measure to the work that we've done together with our GCC partners, has been in stabilizing regional conflicts. Those are still raging. There's still much more work to be done. But in Yemen, we've seen there's a ceasefire and the peace process has begun; it's at its incipient stage. But the situation today is far better than it was a year ago.\nLikewise, in Syria, a fragile Cessation of Hostilities, but it has held so far for the past seven weeks -- again, thanks to the work that the United States has done in partnership with the GCC partners and others. And we're seeing the relaunch of political talks. Again, much more needs to be done and we're far from having achieved the goals that we set, but the trend line is positive.\nIn Iraq, Iraqi security forces, supported by the coalition -- which include a number of GCC countries -- have pushed ISIL back from more than 40 percent of the territory it once controlled.\nAnd finally, Libya, where we've worked to try to ensure that we and the GCC countries are on the same page, we now see the Government of National Accord has entered Tripoli and begun operating. So more work to be done, but that's what the President is going to want to discuss with his GCC colleagues on April 21st.\nOther issues that will be discussed -- Ben mentioned them -- but I'd say we also want to talk about what we can do on the economic front to help each other confront some of the economic challenges that we face. And then on the issue of governance, inclusivity, human rights, those are issues that the President brings up every time he meets with his GCC counterparts, and that will be part of what he'll want to discuss as well -- what can be done to ensure that our governments are more responsive to the needs and aspirations of their people.\nSo it's a very rich agenda, but I think as we've seen over the past year, it's already paid off dividends in what we did in Iraq and Camp David. And we'll build on that and lay the groundwork for what will be done over the coming months.\nAnd I'll now pass it over to Charlie.\nMR. KUPCHAN: Thank you, Rob. The stops in the United Kingdom and Germany offer the President the opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues with two of his closest partners and allies. The bilateral meetings will cover a broad range of issues, as Ben mentioned. I'll just tick off a few of the issues that will certainly be part of the conversations.\nOne is to push forward counterterrorism cooperation, especially coming on the heels of the attacks that took place in Brussels. And we will be discussing both how to increase cooperation across the Atlantic and what Europeans themselves can do to better integrate their various agencies within countries and across borders so that they do a better job of sharing information and taking the steps necessary to counter ISIL operatives that may threaten further attacks in Europe.\nComing off of the stop in the Middle East that Rob just described, they will be discussing the counter-ISIL campaign, what the next steps are on that front, and where we are in the Cessation of Hostilities with Syria, next steps on the political process. They will be also discussing Ukraine, discussing what the next steps are in getting both Russia and Ukraine to move forward on the implementation of the Minsk agreement.\nMigration will also be a key issue. As you all know, the EU-Turkey deal recently took effect. We see this as a critical step in trying to create a more orderly system of managing the flow of migrants and refugees in Europe. And the President will be discussing with Prime Minister Cameron and Chancellor Merkel how that deal is going and what the United States could do to ensure its effectiveness.\nFinally, there will also be a discussion of the NATO summit, which is upcoming in July in Warsaw. The President will be discussing the agenda in preparation for that summit and the importance of NATO addressing its challenges, both on the eastern and on the southern flanks.\nIn Germany, there will also be a focus on economic issues, as there will be in the UK, but because the stop in Germany is -- coincides with the opening of the Hannover Messe, the President and the Chancellor will be talking about the importance of T-TIP to try to build momentum for the conclusion of the agreement, and to build support for the T-TIP agreement. They will also be discussing the importance of stimulating growth, and what can be done to increase job prospects and bring down unemployment on both sides of the Atlantic.\nAnd in the case of the Hannover Messe itself, it is the largest industrial technology trade fair in the world. We're expecting 6,500 exhibitors, over 200,000 visitors from 70 countries. Three hundred U.S. companies are expected to be present, and 70 economic development organizations from the United States. So we see this as a very important opportunity for the President and Chancellor Merkel to work together on commerce, on trade, on innovation, on exploring the intersection of the digital and the industrial economies, and on -- in general, on elevating how important transatlantic commerce is to countries on both sides of the Atlantic, and what can be done to further both investment and trade.\nQ: Hi, thanks. I'm wondering if you can address how the President will talk about Brexit and his position on it in his London stop, particularly when he speaks to the town hall with youth on Saturday. How boldly will he go on that topic? And what are some of the risks that you see in him going to London at this particular juncture?\nMR. RHODES: Well, look, first of all, I think we always believe it's worthwhile to go to the United Kingdom, to go to London; he's been several times as President. We have no closer partner in the world on our top priorities -- again, whether that's counter-ISIL, counterterrorism, promoting security and economic growth broadly.\nSo we will have a very full agenda in simply dealing with the bilateral and multilateral issues that we have before us. Of course, we know that the UK has an upcoming referendum in late June with respect to its EU membership. Ultimately, our position is certainly that this is a matter for the people of the United Kingdom to decide. It's their decision.\nAs the President has said, we support a strong United Kingdom in the European Union. For us, the UK is a key partner, and the EU is a key partner. And we believe that all of us benefit when the EU can speak with a strong and single voice, and can work with us to advance our shared interests, whether on security or prosperity.\nWe believe that the United States benefits from a strong UK economy. And we believe that the UK has benefitted from the single market. That is good for the British economy and that, in turn, is good for the United States economy, because we benefit from that relationship with both the UK, but also the European Union broadly.\nAnd of course, for many decades, the United States has benefitted greatly from the role that the United Kingdom plays in the world, a truly unique role as a leader on behalf of not just security and prosperity, but democratic values. And part of the way in which the UK has exercised that leadership is through the European Union, just as they've also exercised that leadership in many other ways around the world.\nSo ultimately, the President is going to address our bilateral and multilateral agenda with the UK. I think his approach will be that if he's asked his view as a friend, he will offer it, but he'll make very clear that this is a matter that the British people themselves will decide when they head to the polls in June.\nMR. KUPCHAN: I will just add a few thoughts to amplify Ben's remarks, and point out that the United Kingdom has exercised an outside influence in the world for the last several centuries. And it's one of the countries that has most shaped the modern era. And we hope that that outside influence continues, and we think that in today's world, that kind of influence is best exercised through clubs, through multilateralism, through teamwork.\nAnd in that respect, it's our estimate that the United Kingdom will continue to play that role most effectively if it remains part of the European Union. We also believe that, on the economic front, when it comes to commerce, when it comes to trade, when it comes to jobs, that the UK economy will be better off within the Union than if it leaves. And as a key economic partner, that's an issue of interest to the United States.\nThe UK has also played a very important role in shaping the evolution of the European Union, in creating an EU that is open, that is interested in enlargement. And we want the UK to continue to play that role.\nAnd finally, I would point out that because of a host of issues -- from migration to sluggish economic growth to the terrorist threat -- the European Union today faces challenges from populism and other threats to its well-being. And the EU is one of the great accomplishments of the post-World War II era. It has succeeded in helping remove war from Europe, and we are concerned about the health and vitality of that experiment.\nAnd in that respect, we would not want to see a Brexit that could potentially damage the European Union and increase the challenges that it faces.\nQ: Hi, thanks. A few months ago, Saudi Arabia offered to send ground troops to fight ISIS if the coalition felt that was necessary. Do you feel the status of that offer -- do you think it's a serious and viable offer. Is it being considered currently? Will it be discussed at the summit? And along the same lines, what do you think the chances are that some of these countries will be contributing more against ISIS? Thanks.\nMR. RHODES: I'll start, and Rob may want to join in here. The first point I'd make is that our strategy with respect to countering ISIL in Syria has focused on supporting, equipping, and, in some instances, training fighters on the ground who are able to take back territory from ISIL. And those would be local forces, not external ground forces.\nWe believe that those are the forces that are best positioned to take and hold territory. And we've seen good progress, steady progress in terms of ISIL losing ground in Syria as it has in Iraq, as we've been able to support Syrian, Kurdish and Arab forces, for instance, in eastern and parts of northern Syria with our airpower, with equipment, with some training.\nAnd the GCC countries have been a part of the coalition that has been providing support to opposition forces, taking strikes against ISIL. So we'll continue to review what additional contributions can be made, but thus far, we've not had the introduction of, for instance, Saudi ground forces.\nI do think we want to make sure that we are using this opportunity to coordinate our efforts to enhance support to opposition forces, and to do what we can to bolster everything from military cooperation to information-sharing in the counter-ISIL campaign. But I'll see if Rob wants to add anything here.\nMR. MALLEY: Yes, on that note -- as Ben said, really, we think these fights are best fought by local partners. And there is sometimes room for external forces, but it has to be done in a smart way. I'm sure we'll be talking not just to the Saudis but to others about what more can be done to fight ISIL, both in Iraq and in Syria.\nBut I think one thing that is -- you asked a question about whether we could expect more. There are many reasons why we feel it's very important to deescalate regional conflicts, first and foremost because of the devastating humanitarian impact that the conflicts in Syria and Yemen in particular have had. But it's also important because we want people -- the fight in Yemen has distracted from the crucial fight against ISIL and against al Qaeda. And as that fight deescalates, the fight against the Houthis and -- deescalates in Yemen, we believe and we think we'll see evidence of it -- that the countries that have been involved in that fight, as they reach a political solution, will be able to focus more of their activities against ISIL and against al Qaeda. That's what we're discussing with them. And I think that's a very important reason why we believe that these regional conflicts that often have a sectarian tinge to them need to be deescalated.\nAnd I think that's why we're gratified by the progress we've made. And we do hope that we and the GCC will be able to do more in the fight against the terrorist threat and work in even greater partnership on that.\nQ: Hi, thanks for doing the call. I wanted to ask about the case of -- there are two Libyan Americans who are imprisoned in the UAE, and I was wondering if there are any plans for President Obama to raise that issue when he is in Riyadh for the GCC meeting. And also, really quickly, if I could just ask, should we also expect the President to do some explaining about the comments he made in The Atlantic interview about \"free riders\"?\nMR. RHODES: Sure. On your first question, we regularly raise cases involving American citizens who are detained overseas. I wouldn't get into the details of those conversations beyond saying that we certainly raise those with the UAE as we would with other countries where there are American citizens who are detained where we may have concerns about their legal status and treatment. And so we'll raise it as appropriate.\nWith respect to your second question, look, I think the President has had a view expressed throughout his administration that the United States has an enormous role to play in upholding our own security agreements. In the Middle East, that would include defending our own national interests, and that -- foremost among those interests is countering terrorism, preventing terrorist safe havens and the potential for attacks against the U.S. or our allies.\nAlso, part of our commitments, as we reiterated at Camp David, include supporting the security and sovereignty of our allies and partners in the region. And that would certainly include the GCC countries who have been longstanding partners of the United States. And we've literally gone to war in their defense -- for instance, in the case of the Gulf War.\nAt the same time, the only way to truly deal with global challenges is if everybody does their part. The nature of the threat from ISIL is not restricted to the targeting of one nation. We see ISIL posing a threat to the entire world, certainly posing a threat to both the GCC countries and to our European allies who we'll be meeting with on this trip.\nAnd so the only way to effectively have a strategy that can degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL is for all of us to do our part. And so we will certainly want to be discussing how we can work together in the military campaign against ISIL, how we can work together to share intelligence and information, how we can dry up the financing networks that ISIL depends upon.\nAnd we have seen important contributions from GCC countries to that effort, both in terms of direct military action, support to opposition forces, and intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation.\nSo the basic point that we want everybody to play their part is a regular feature of our dialogue with these countries, publicly and privately. We do believe that we've had good cooperation and enhanced cooperation since the summit last year, but there's always room to see what more can be done. As Rob said, for instance, one element of this is that as the conflict in Yemen, hopefully, moves to a more political track with the current Cessation of Hostilities, we believe that that could open up some additional space for efforts against ISIL and al Qaeda. So we'll be discussing that as well.\nMR. KUPCHAN: I would just add, from a NATO perspective, that at the Wales summit, Allies made a commitment to move toward spending 2 percent of GDP on defense, and the United Kingdom, after a tough internal debate, stuck to that commitment, which the President is grateful for, and gives the President and Prime Minister Cameron the ability to work hard in the lead-in to the Warsaw summit to get additional NATO Allies to follow suit.\nAnd we expect to make progress on that front precisely because Europe is now faced with a new need for spending on the security front in light of the situation on the eastern frontier, the migrant flow, as well as the threat from ISIL and the terrorism issue.\nMR. RHODES: Just to put a finer point on that, Darlene, I mean, in the case of defense spending, the UK was the opposite of the free rider in terms of not only meeting its own 2 percent commitment, but leading through the Wales process and assuring that that remained a commitment of the Alliance. And we'd like to see all of our NATO Allies heed that example in raising their defense spending to a 2-percent level.\nQ: Hey, guys. So two quick questions; one on Saudi Arabia. If you could talk a little bit about where you think the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia stands? There's a lot of folks who describe it as maybe not as low as it's ever been, but certainly rough, given the Saudi kind of belief that maybe the United States doesn't have its back as it once did.\nAnd then on Brexit and Europe, whether -- to try to push you a little bit more on Darlene's question I think, or maybe Roberta's question, on the extent to which he, in either the town hall or the speech in Germany, is going to specifically make a point to bring up and call for the UK to stay in the European Union.\nMR. RHODES: So on your second question, I think the approach he's going to take is that he will offer his view as he is asked his view. He will make very clear that this is a decision for the people of the United Kingdom to make, it's not a decision for us to make.\nBut we have no closer friend in the world, and if we are asked our view as a friend, we will offer it. And he'll have, I'm sure, an opportunity to be asked his view, given the press conference, given the town hall. And that's the approach he'll take -- one of, again being very mindful and deferential to the fact that this is a decision for the British people, but also being very straightforward and candid as a friend as to why the United States believes that it is good for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union.\nThe speech in Germany I think will have a much broader range to it in that he'll be addressing all of the challenges facing the transatlantic community at this time.\nOn the first question, I'll hand it over to Rob. One thing I'd just say is that, look, there have always been complexities in the U.S.-Saudi relationship. There's been a core to that relationship in which we cooperate on shared interests like counterterrorism, like the stability of the global economy and the security and sovereignty of Saudi Arabia. So that's remained constant throughout this administration as in the previous administration, even as -- given how different our two countries are, there are inevitably going to be differences that emerge.\nMR. MALLEY: I think I may be -- the relationship, the depth and intensity and the density of the relationship in terms of the results of our partnership, I outlined it earlier, but also I'd say this is going to be the fourth visit that President Obama is making to Saudi Arabia -- I think it's more than any President ever. And that's just one measure -- it's not the only one -- but one measure of the closeness of the relationship.\nAs Ben said, it's always been a complicated one, but at the same time, the region itself has gone through the most tumultuous period probably in decades. And that has meant that our views and those of some of our partners in the region, and Saudi Arabia in particular, have not always been perfectly aligned as we've confronted the challenges that this upheaval has created.\nBut I think we've made -- I know President Obama has and King Salman has made an effort to do our best to discuss those issues and to make sure that, regardless of those differences, our interests and our policies are fully aligned on the issues that Ben mentioned -- our common fight against terrorism and on trying to stabilize and shore up the world economy.\nI think you'll see that. The differences are not going to disappear, but our work together is not going to disappear either. In fact, I think this summit will show how much has been accomplished over the last year and how much more can be done in the coming months.\nQ: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for doing this. Two questions. The first is on Saudi Arabia. They're expected to roll out in the coming days or weeks the National Transformation Plan, which obviously could have a huge economic impact and change in our economy. So I'm wondering the extent to which that will come up in the President's conversations, and whether that might satisfy or address some of the issues that the President has expressed with the Saudis.\nAnd then I know you guys brought up refugees, and I'm wondering, in Germany, the extent to which -- or what the President's message will be on refugees, and whether we're going to hear echoes of the sort of politics of that situation both in Germany, obviously, as it's affected Chancellor Merkel, and here in the U.S., as it's kind of had an impact on the 2016 election.\nMR. RHODES: Look, I think on refugees, we recognize that there are just enormous challenges being confronted by Germany and our European allies, that given their proximity to Syria and to the Middle East and North Africa, they have substantially more refugee flows from those conflict areas than we do.\nWe believe that Chancellor Merkel has shown enormous courage and vision in trying to find ways to accommodate refugees, even as Europe has been also seeking ways to negotiate with Turkey to manage those refugee flows. And I think he'll make the point that inclusivity is an important value for both the United States and Europe. And I think he'll want to applaud Chancellor Merkel's leadership and what's she's done, and under difficult circumstances, while also being mindful that there are obviously concerns about how much can be absorbed in terms of refugee flows, given the scale of the challenge in Europe.\nI would say that, on the counterterrorism side, I think he'll also be making the point that the key element in counterterrorism is not turning off migration; it is good intelligence-sharing and information-sharing. It's being able to identify who is a threat. And that may not at all be from within a refugee population. That may be from long-established populations in Europe, as we've seen in some of the recent plots.\nMR. KUPCHAN: I would just add that I think we do believe that Chancellor Merkel demonstrated bold leadership in responding to the refugee crisis, and the President wants to provide political support to her for doing so, and then work with her to make sure that the new system that is in place to deal with Turkey is effective. And there they will be discussing the operation -- the NATO operation in the Aegean, working with Turkey to help go after the smuggling networks that have been responsible for backstopping or making possible the flow.\nI think they'll also be looking at our work with Greece, because Greece is also shouldering an inordinate share of the burden, and we need to help Greece with processing and with hosting the refugees that are there, and also focusing on coming up with a sustainable plan forward for the Greek economy. And then I also think there will be a longer conversation about the handling of the refugee problem on a broader global basis.\nMR. MALLEY: Thanks for that question. It's really a good reminder that our relationship with the GCC is not just a security relationship, it's a much more multifaceted one. And in particular -- and I mentioned it earlier -- the President and the GCC leaders are going to want to talk about the economy and economic challenges that they face given the drop in oil prices and what the reaction to that could be.\nAnd so I think you're going to see that coming up not just in the summit itself between the President and the GCC leaders, but in the bilateral between the President and King Salman. And I'm sure that the President is going to want to hear from King Salman and others in the Kingdom what their ideas are in terms of dealing -- and what their economic plan is. This was already broached when King Salman visited here in September, but a lot has happened since then, and I suspect that this is going to be an important part both of their discussion and of the summit itself.\nQ: Thank you very much. My question is either for Rob or Ben. One of the other comments that the President made (inaudible) the GCC countries is that they have to learn to share the region with Iran, when many believe that Iran is the aggressor through its proxy support in Lebanon, Iran, and Iraq, and Yemen and Syria. What assurance would the President give them that he's not favoring Iran, as he's seen?\nAnd my second question is: Do we expect any announcement of some kind of weapon deal sales during this summit? Thanks.\nMR. RHODES: Sure, thanks, Nadia. First of all, last year's summit took place in the middle of the finalization of the Iran deal. I think we would argue that the removal of the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran is good for the United States and the GCC. And in one year we see that over the course of the last year, Iran has converted its heavy-water reactor, shipped out its stockpile of enriched uranium, taken out a significant number of its centrifuges, and abided by its key commitments under the Iran deal. And that that's good for the security of the region.\nAt the same time, we continue to have very serious concerns about destabilizing activities by Iran in the region -- whether it's their support for proxies in Yemen, their support for the Assad regime in Syria, their support for Hezbollah and their threats towards similar GCC partners. And we've worked to confront those challenges. We've imposed additional sanctions for ballistic missile activity by Iran. We supported the interdiction of weapons shipments emanating from Iran. And we've made clear that part of our dialogue with the GCC is going to be focused on how we can counter Iranian destabilizing activities in the region. And so we're not at all going to take our eye off the ball when it comes to the threats posed by Iran. In fact, one of the bases for our discussions with the GCC is how are we enhancing our capabilities to, again, counter any destabilizing activities.\nWith respect to that comment, I think the key point there is that ultimately we also believe that the political resolution of some of the conflicts that have been tearing at the region would be in everybody's interest; that, for instance, if you were able to reach a political resolution in Syria, a political resolution in Yemen, ultimately that will help stabilize the region.\nNow, to be clear, we have had different views from Iran about how the conflicts should be resolved, specifically in Syria, of course. We believe that Bashar al-Assad needs to leave power as part of a political resolution. So the fact that we believe that ultimately political solutions are in our shared interests does not mean that we don't take positions about how those conflicts should be resolved that may at times be at odds with Iran. But we do believe that ultimately there's not a military resolution to the challenges in the region. And that has been a position of ours.\nMR. MALLEY: If you just compare the depth of our security relationship with the GCC, on the one hand, that we've spent much of the past hour talking about, and on the other hand, the actions that we've taken that Ben mentioned, and then some, to counter Iran's destabilizing activities, I don't think that there can be any confusion or ambiguity about who is our partner in the region and who isn't. So I think that confusion should be easily put to rest.\nHaving said that, I think the President made that clear a year ago at the summit. And he'll make it clear again that we want to enable the GCC to be in a position to better counter Iran's destabilizing activities, not in order to fuel an open-ended conflict between the GCC and Iran, but rather in order to put them in a position -- the GCC -- to engage Iran from a position of strength in order to try to resolve both their differences and some of the regional conflicts.\nBecause deep down, this conflict between the GCC and particularly between Saudi Arabia and Iran, it fuels chaos, sectarianism, and instability in the region, all of which help ISIL and other terrorist groups. And that's why we think -- what the President spoke was a \"cold peace\" -- that was his expression -- and that's what we need to do. We're not trading for the GCC. As I said, it's clear who our allies and who our partners are. But if there could be a different relationship between the GCC and Iran, one that is less prone to fuel proxy wars, it's our conviction, and certainly the President's conviction, that that would be good for the region, good for the GCC, and good for stability overall.\nMR. RHODES: And sorry, guys, just on your last question, one thing I have to say is this is less about large sales of defense systems. But we do expect to have very specific conversations about how to enhance certain defense capabilities across the Gulf. We've done some work over the course of the last year, but we want to expand that. And so that will be the focus -- enhancing GCC capability, interoperability, how to confront asymmetric threats. So I think that that will -- building on the ministerial that Secretary Carter will have the day before the President arrives will be a focus of that discussion.\nThanks, everybody, for joining the call.\nEND 3:12 P.M.

John Kasich is highly suited to carry the GOP banner into the general election.\nKasich's qualifications are all the clearer — screamingly so — when matched against those of competitors Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.\n[...]\nAs a mature, grounded politician, Kasich competes well against them both.\nAlthough he was largely overtalked in debates that were staged like gladiatorial contests, Kasich has nonetheless drawn the favorable attention of voters across the country. He alone runs ahead of Clinton in polls and is neck and neck with Sanders.\nKasich's support is well deserved, starting with deep and successful governmental experience.\nNine terms of congressional service included crafting the first U.S. balanced budget in nearly four decades. In 2010, he narrowly won election as Ohio governor and he was reelected in a landslide four years later. While meeting with the Daily News Editorial Board, he was both ebulliently folksy and fully versed on the innards of policy.\nOn the ideological spectrum, Kasich meets the tests of Republican conservatism.\nHe believes in reducing taxes to stimulate economic growth. He tried, and failed, to limit public employee collective bargaining rights in Ohio. He staunchly opposes abortion and stands up for Second Amendment rights. (He did support the 1994 assault weapons ban, but he would not reinstate the law.)\nIn the presidential campaign, he calls for cutting the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 28%, and rules out any increase in government spending, aside from the military and programs like Medicaid, for nine years. Although Ohio voters have indexed the state minimum wage (now $8.10) to inflation, he stands against hiking the federal minimum of $7.25.\nAlthough far out of sync with the Daily News' philosophy, all of that says Kasich's presidential plans should please the GOP conservative faithful. At the same time, in an era frozen by dogma, he stands out for understanding that progress in a democracy can demand compromise.\n[...]\nIn the strongest possible terms, the Daily News endorses John Kasich in the April 19 Republican primary, first because he would well represent the Republican Party in November (when a contest with Clinton would be welcome) and second because every vote for Kasich is a vote against a recklessly arrogant man who would demean the highest office in the land.\nRead the full editorial here.", "timestamp": "2016-04-14", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: New York Daily News Endorses John Kasich"}

Nelson, D-FL)\nThe Administration appreciates the Senate's bipartisan effort to advance an aviation reauthorization bill. In the past, the Congress has managed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through a series of short-term patches, creating significant uncertainty for the FAA and undermining the agency's ability to make long-term capital investments and plan for the future. Though the Administration believes that eighteen months do not provide the long-term certainty that the FAA needs to advance on its critical priorities, the Administration appreciates that the bill is intended to enable a longer-term dialogue about the future of our aviation system.\nThe Administration's priorities for a long-term aviation reauthorization bill include the need to ensure safety, serve the public interest, modernize the air traffic control system, and better align aviation resources with the needs of the National Airspace (NAS). The bill contains some provisions that advance these priorities. However, it also includes provisions that would undermine the FAA's ability to address critical challenges, like mandating controller hiring preferences and limiting FAA's ability to make business-like decisions about its services.\nThere are also a number of provisions within the bill that need to be improved, particularly as it relates to safety, security, and the environment. For example, with regards to safety, while the Administration shares Congress' goal of fast and efficient integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the NAS, the FAA must be able to maintain regulatory flexibility. The bill would direct the Department of Transportation to develop certification standards for small UAS so that companies could engage in the widespread transportation of property two years from passage. This kind of overly prescriptive means of integrating UAS using legislation would disrupt the ongoing rulemaking process. From a security perspective, the bill would require the Transportation Security Administration to establish screening and other measures at certain small airports, meaning the agency would be required to reallocate staff and equipment from higher-risk, higher-need facilities. The bill also includes provisions related to air tours over national parks, which could negatively impact the visitor experience and protection of park natural resources.\nThe bill also should do more with regards to infrastructure investment. For the past seven years, the Administration has called on the Congress to provide flexibility to airports to invest in a stronger aviation system. This bill misses an opportunity to improve airport infrastructure by not allowing for adjustments to Passenger Facility Charges in tandem with reforms to the Airport Improvement Program.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to pass an FAA reauthorization bill that strengthens our aviation system, improves safety, and maintains the leadership of the U.S. in global aviation.", "timestamp": "2016-04-14", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: Senate Substitute Amendment to H.R. 636 – Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2016"}

It can't be a surprise to him that serving as Commander-in-Chief is a critical part of the job. We're therefore deeply troubled by his continued lack of interest in and knowledge of essential foreign policy and national security issues. His recent interview with the New York Daily News demonstrates this problem anew.\n\"Senator Sanders was asked specific – but not unexpected or unusual – questions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He couldn't answer, but said that if he 'had some paper' in front of him, he might be able to. He was asked his opinion on key parts of the Obama Administration's counter-terrorism strategy. Again, he couldn't answer. That's concerning, especially just a few weeks after the attack in Brussels. The same goes for what he said about how he'd go about interrogating captured terrorists if he were President.  'Actually, I haven't thought about it a whole lot,' he said. That's surprising, to say the least – particularly given the dangerous proposals we're hearing from Republicans on using torture and keeping the Guantanamo Bay detention facility open.\n\"These were not 'gotcha' questions. As people who have advised presidents on critical issues like these, we know how important it is to have a Commander-in-Chief who has a deep grasp of them – or who, at the very least, takes them seriously enough to reach beyond the basics. We respect Senator Sanders's passion for building a better America, but we are troubled by his continued inability to articulate a vision of our nation's role in the world.\n\"Many of us raised concerns earlier this year that Senator Sanders had not thought through crucial national security issues.

Good morning, everybody!\nAudience members. Good morning!\nThe President. Oh, welcome to the White House! Thank you, William, for your outstanding service, and your beautiful family. I heard, I think, your youngest one saying, \"Daddy! It's Daddy!\" [Laughter] So she's proud too.\nVice President Joe Biden. See her waving at you?\nThe President. Hey, you. [Laughter]\nI want to thank outstanding advocates on behalf of our men and women in uniform and our veterans. First of all, our Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Secretary McDonald. Please give him a big round of applause. And somebody who's got veterans' backs every single day, Vice President Biden. Please give him a big round of applause. [Applause] They like you.\nNow, let me just first of all say, this seems to be an exceptionally good-looking group here. I do want to check, though, to see how the distribution is. First of all, I understand we do have some Army here. Navy! [Applause] Air Force! [Applause] Marines! [Applause] Coast Guard! [Applause] All right, Coast Guard. [Laughter] And we've got some of your biggest fans, which is our extraordinary military families. Yes.\nWe hold a lot of events here at the White House, but few are as inspiring as this one. Over the past 7 years, this has become one of our favorite traditions. This year, we've got 40 Active Duty riders and 25 veterans. Many of you are recovering from major injuries. You've learned how to adapt to a new life. Some of you are still working through wounds that are harder to see, like posttraumatic stress. And like countless riders across the country, part of this great movement is to help each other, for all of us to see each other get across that finish line. And that's how America is supposed to work. That's how our military works. And it doesn't stop when you take off the uniform.\nWe're joined by Marine Captain Jessica Bilkovich. Where's Jessica? There she is, back there. Jessica was injured in training, but went on to serve in Afghanistan. And over time, her injuries compounded. In addition to intense back pain, she was also struggling with posttraumatic stress and depression. It took her 6 months to make the phone call for help, but thanks to the love and support of her husband, she finally reached out. And as part of her treatment, she discovered cycling. On her first ride, Jessica says, \"I felt so free, like a weight was coming off.\" The Soldier Ride gives her the chance to do what she loves. And, Jessica, you are an inspiration; we could not be prouder of the example that you're setting for so many people.\nWe have Army Staff Sergeant Casey McEuin. Where's Casey? Casey is back there. Decorated veteran, Casey served for 15 years with the 4th Infantry Division, including in Afghanistan.\nAudience member. Hooah! The President. Injured in an attack on his outpost, he had to medically retire, something he had never imagined. And he felt lost, struggling to find work and living out of his Jeep. And then, some veterans' service organizations helped him get back on his feet. And today, he's still fighting for his brothers and sisters in arms, working at Hired Heroes USA, which helps connect our returning heroes with job opportunities. Casey is a proud rider today. We are proud of you, Casey. Thank you.\nAnd that's what's so remarkable about this ride, dreamt up by a bartender. [Laughter] Yes, some of my best ideas have come in a bar. [Laughter]\nAudience member. Hooah!\nThe President. You too, huh? [Laughter] But this is one of those ideas that the next day, actually, it was still good. [Laughter] It's a reminder—that was not in the script. [Laughter]\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs Robert A. McDonald. Yes. [Laughter]\nThe President. It's a reminder of the power of one person to launch a movement that changes people's lives. It's a reminder of the sacrifices that our men and women in uniform have made to keep our Nation free. And it's a reminder that, for those who are called to serve, their mission doesn't end on the battlefield: It's one you carry with you for the rest of your lives.\nOur veterans will tell you themselves, they may have put away their uniforms, but they're not finished serving their country. That includes our wounded warriors who here today, who often tell me that as soon as they can, they want to serve their country again. Service is in their DNA. Giving back is what you all do.\nBut as we all know, many of our returning heroes still have a hard time connecting opportunities to community and finding ways to serve. And today I want to thank our incredible veterans' service organizations who step up for veterans every day, making that connection. Organizations like The Mission Continues. Organizations like Team Red, White, and Blue. Organizations like Team Rubicon.\nSo I know you guys are ready to ride. I just want to close with a quick story. We're joined today by Air Force Technical Sergeant Jason Miller. Where's Jason?\nTSgt. Jason Miller. Right here, sir.\nThe President. There's Jason right there. Jason served four combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. Came home with his body intact, but inside he was struggling with wounds nobody could see. And Jason doesn't mind me telling you all that he got depressed enough that he considered taking his life. Four years ago, he wrote me a letter about what he was going through. And he told me about how hard it was to get the services and the support that he needed. As luck would have it, right around that time I happened to meet with Team Rubicon, which deploys veterans for emergency response to disasters. And in addition to making sure that the VA was following up with Jason, I also asked Team Rubicon to get in touch with him. It helps when you're Commander in Chief. [Laughter] You've got—folks take your phone call. [Laughter]\nTeam Rubicon reached out. Jason ended up joining Team Rubicon, deployed to Moore, Oklahoma, which was devastated by a tornado. And feeling an immediate bond with his teammates, he threw himself into the work of helping people pick up their lives. In the process, he found a path to a new life of his own. And when Jason talks about what this new opportunity to serve means, he quotes Ghandi. He says, \"The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.\"\nAnd Jason's spirit, the spirit of all of you, is the story of our Armed Forces. It's about dedicating your life to a cause that is bigger than yourself. It's about support and love for each other and for our country that flows through everybody who serves under our proud flag. And it's about the country that pledges to be with you every step of the way, not just when we need you, but also when you need us.\nThat's why every day I have left—that I have left in this office, I'm going to keep doing everything that I can to make sure that we serve you as well as you've served us. And that means making sure you get the care and benefits that you've earned and that you deserve. It means making sure you and your families have the opportunities to continue to contribute to our Nation's success, to achieve your own dreams. You represent what's best about our Nation, and I hope all of American—all of the American people along the route will come out and show their support for these heroes, not just today, but every single day.\nSo God bless you. God bless all our military families, all who serve. God bless America.\nWith that, we are going to let William strap up, and then I am going to blow the horn, which I always really enjoy. [Laughter] All right, come on.", "timestamp": "2016-04-14", "title": "Remarks at the Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride Opening Ceremony"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117074", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:12 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Friday. (Laughter.) I have a 1:15 p.m. meeting today, so hopefully, Josh, you can help me get out of here on time.\nQ: Let's do it. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: All right.\nQ: We want to help you.\nMR. EARNEST: Good.\nQ: We're here to help.\nMR. EARNEST: And I'm sorry that Mark is not here because I can't tell my usual joke about how I know you're eager to get started on your weekend, so we'll go fast.\nI do want to just do a short mention of some of the news coverage today about the President's focus on eliminating anticompetitive behavior. And we have seen the administration, over the course of the presidency, look for opportunities to actually promote competition in markets because we understand that competition is good for our economy. It promotes innovation and leads to positive results for consumers. There are a variety of ways to assess that; in fact, this is actually one of the core principles of the Affordable Care Act, is promoting greater competition in the health care market.\nThe President talked today about how the administration is supportive of an effort to try to promote greater competition when it comes to set-top boxes for television. This would also provide an incentive for greater innovation in a way that could save consumers money.\nSo I know that many of you have taken a look at this announcement today and heard the President talk about this a little bit in his interview with Yahoo! that he taped yesterday. But I wanted to make sure that you all understood that this is a core priority of the administration, something that we intend to continue to move in the direction of over the course of the last nine months here that the President has remaining in office.\nSo with that, let's go to the questions.\nQ: Great, thanks, Josh. Let me start with North Korea and the failed missile launch there. We understand from U.S. officials that this was a Musudan rocket which could eventually be capable of hitting U.S. facilities that are located in Asia. Is that the case? And does the threat that would be posed to having U.S. facilities in range of these rockets change the calculus at all in terms of the U.S. response?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, we are aware of reports that North Korea conducted a failed ballistic missile test recently. The United States will continue to monitor and assess the situation in close coordination with our regional allies and partners.\nAs we've done before, the United States strongly condemns this provocative act by the North Korean government. It is in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that explicitly prohibit North Korea's use of ballistic missile technology. The United States is strongly committed to the defense of our allies, particularly our allies in Asia -- that includes the Republic of Korea and Japan. And we're going to continue to stand with them as they face these threats, but also reiterate our commitment to the defense of our allies.\nAs it relates to the threat to U.S. interests, we're obviously keenly aware of that as well. I have talked -- unfortunately, I've had the occasion to discuss several times over the course of the last three or four months the steps that the United States has taken to bolster our missile defense capabilities in the region. And these are defense capabilities -- missile defense capabilities that have been shifted to this region of the world in response to this threat. And this includes the deployment of some naval assets to the region, as well as the deployment of some assets to Alaska to ensure that the U.S. homeland remains safe.\nThe assessment of the President's military commanders is that we do have the capabilities necessary to protect the United States, but we obviously continue to work with the international community to make clear that North Korea faces the prospect of even further isolation as a result of their provocative acts.\nQ: The head of Iran's central bank is in town, along with a number of other heads of central banks. And he really went off on the U.S. this morning, saying that, you're not living up to your side of the commitment of the nuclear deal, and that if the U.S. doesn't take pretty significant further steps to restore Iranian access to the financial system, that this nuclear deal will just fall apart. Are you confident that at this point the U.S. is fully meeting its commitments under the JCPOA?\nMR. EARNEST: To just answer your question bluntly, yes. The United States is fulfilling our commitments to the JCPOA consistent with the letter and spirit of that agreement.\nYou will recall that we only agreed to do so once we could verify -- the international community could verify -- that Iran had followed through on their commitments. They have. That's good news. They reduced their nuclear stockpile by 98 percent. They took thousands of centrifuges out of operation. They've taken steps to essentially make their heavy water plutonium reactor harmless -- or at least incapable of producing nuclear weapons material. And the United States -- as a result, the United States, along with the rest of the international community, is committed to living up to our end of the bargain.\nJust to clarify one aspect of your question, that does not involve giving Iran access to the U.S. financial system. That is not part of the deal. It wasn't part of the deal. And it's not something that we are contemplating. But there is sanctions relief that's included in the agreement, and we intend to follow through on granting that -- we are following through on granting that sanctions relief as a result of our verification that Iran has complied with the terms of the agreement that they signed.\nQ: Going back to that final part of your answer, one of the specific things that the head of the central bank said in an interview while he was here was that Iran expects -- based on their understanding of what is part of this deal -- that the U.S. will begin to allow the U-turn transactions that they have sought for access to the dollar. So given what you've just said and what Secretary Lew and others have said, is the head of the Iranian central bank incorrect in his understanding of what was part of this hard-fought deal?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, this is highly technical, so I want to try to speak as bluntly as I can. The agreement that's included in the JCPOA does not include giving Iran access to the U.S. financial system or to allow the execution of so-called U-turn transactions. And we have ruled out giving Iran access to either of those two options.\nBut we are committed to ensuring that we fulfill our end of the JCPOA, and that involves following through with giving Iran the kind of sanctions relief to which they're entitled, as a result of them following through on the steps that they have taken to roll back significant aspects of their nuclear program and to make clear that they will not acquire a nuclear weapon.\nQ: And in the Democratic debate last night, Bernie Sanders repeated his whole thing -- if he becomes the nominee, that the President would pull the nomination of Merrick Garland. And he specifically said he's concerned that Chief Judge Garland has not shown that he would be committed to overturning the Citizens United decision. Given the amount that we've heard from the President lambasting that decision over the past number of years, how confident is the White House that Judge Garland would pursue that kind of an approach?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, what I can tell you is the President has complete confidence that Chief Judge Garland has demonstrated over his long career on the federal bench to fairly interpreting the law. In fact, he understands that the responsibility of a judge is to interpret the law, not advance a political agenda.\nAs we also discussed, the President did not have a specific discussion with potential nominees about how they would rule in particular cases. That raises some questions about a conflict because obviously there are some cases where the executive branch, represented by the Solicitor General before the Supreme Court, advocates for a particular position.\nRather, what the President has chosen to do is to consider the jurisprudence of individual nominees. Chief Judge Garland actually has a longer track record than any other Supreme Court nominee in history. He's got more experience serving from the federal bench than any other person that's ever been nominated to the Supreme Court. So there is an opportunity for us to consider his approach to the law, and the President believes that his approach to the law is consistent with what the Framers of our Constitution intended.\nAnd look, the President is not the only person who feels this way. Republicans feel this way, too. Senator Orrin Hatch -- a conservative, a Republican, somebody who has served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for years -- also described Chief Judge Garland as a consensus nominee. So I don't know what that means for how he might rule in a hypothetical case at some point in the future, but I do know that the President has complete confidence that Chief Judge Garland would do what Supreme Court justices are supposed to do, which is interpret the law, not seek to advance a political agenda. And that's why the President nominated him in the first place.\nThat's why we've been pleased to see Republicans indicate, at least in their private conversations with Chief Judge Garland, that they are impressed with his credentials, with his character, and with his approach to his job. We simply believe that those conversations, many of which have now taken place in private -- which is entirely appropriate and consistent with the process that is typically pursued by the Senate -- we just believe that the next step should also occur, which is that members of the Senate Judiciary Committee should give the American people the opportunity to hear directly from Chief Judge Garland and get a better sense of how exactly he would approach the job of the Supreme Court justice when it comes to offering an opinion on issues like campaign finance reform that has significant consequences for our country and our democracy.\nRoberta.\nQ: Turning to Egypt, there are huge protests in Cairo today with people calling for the downfall of the el-Sisi government -- concerns with human rights and the economy and the transfer of two islands to Saudi Arabia. So I'm wondering, how concerned is the United States about this unrest? Is this something that the President hopes to discuss when he meets with King Salman and other leaders next week?\nAnd Senator Graham has called for emergency aid to help Egypt become more stable and bolster the country. Is that something that the White House is interested in exploring?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen the specifics of Senator Graham's proposal. I can tell you that the United States has an important security relationship with Egypt, or that the importance of that security relationship has not eclipsed the concerns that we have with some of the human rights policies that have been on display from the Egyptian government. And these are concerns that relate to the treatment of some political opponents of the government and, in some cases, even the treatment of journalists. We have not papered over those differences.\nBut at the same time, the United States does have an important security relationship with Egypt. And we spent a little time earlier this week talking about the MFO mission that the United States strongly supports on the Sinai Peninsula. Our support for that ongoing mission and promoting the treaty between Israel and Egypt is something that is critical to our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel, but it's also important to at least eliminating one potential element of volatility in an already chaotic region of the world.\nSo U.S. interests in Egypt are significant, and we'll obviously continue to watch the situation carefully.\nQ: Okay, just going back to North Korea for a second. I'm wondering what you make of the response from China to this latest failed test. The Chinese state media seemed a little pointed in its response. They called it the latest in a string of saber-rattling. And I guess I'm wondering what you make of that and what the U.S. is expecting from China in terms of a response to the latest incident.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as we have seen a number of provocative acts from North Korea over the last few months, we've been pleased to see the international community continue to stand with the United States in insisting that North Korea put an end to these provocative actions and statements. So we're going to continue to work closely with the Chinese government to apply pressure to North Korea.\nWe did succeed earlier this year in imposing sanctions against North Korea that will have an impact on certain industries in North Korea that we know are critical to financing some of these military activities that are inconsistent with U.N. Security Council resolutions. Passing those kinds of sanctions and forcefully implementing them would not have been possible without the constructive diplomatic relationship between China and the United States. So we certainly value that relationship, and it has significant consequences for U.S. national security.\nChina and the United States are going to continue to work with the rest of the international community in a way that has important security benefits for our allies in South Korea and Japan. And we're going to continue to apply that pressure, and we're going to continue to work with China to make sure that the North Koreans understand that going down the path of repeated provocations is not in the best interest of the region or the citizens of their country.\nMichelle.\nQ: The problem with North Korea and its behavior has always been what sanctions, what action can you take that would actually change behaviors. So with these unprecedented sanctions being passed, obviously that hasn't changed the behavior yet. So what do you see as the best bet moving forward for that behavior to actually change? Is there something more that China is going to have to do?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think at this point it's too early to assess the complete impact of the sanctions that were only put in place I believe a month or so ago. But I would acknowledge that the premise of your question is not insignificant, which is, it's not clear exactly what will succeed in compelling the North Korean government to pursue a different approach. And the good news is that we know that there's no country that has more influence over the North Korean government than China. And China fully shares the concerns that we have expressed. So we're going to continue to rely on that relationship, but we're also going to continue to lead the international community in this response. And we do so because of the significant consequences for U.S. national security, but we also do so because of our concerns about increasing destabilization in Asia. And that is what these kinds of provocative acts do, they only destabilize the situation, and that's not good for our allies in Japan and South Korea.\nAnd so that's why this continues to be a priority and one that we're going to continue to address.\nQ: It was pretty surprising yesterday to hear Susan Rice put numbers on ISIS's activity. And she said in the last year and a half there have been about 150 attacks that ISIS has attempted, all of these outside of Syria and Iraq. So that's one every couple of days. Where have most of these been? Can you shed a little more light on those attempted attacks? And also, every day we talk about how the coalition is pounding ISIS, that they're losing territory, they're having trouble gaining more territory. But when you see numbers like this, do you expect that pace of attempted attacks to continue? And that shows that after a year and a half of pounding ISIS, the desire to attack doesn't seem to have diminished at all outside of Iraq and Syria.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have specific information to provide in addition to those numbers that you heard from the National Security Advisor. What I can tell you is there are a couple things that we know about ISIL.\nThe first is, we know that they have attempted to establish a safe haven in Syria because that is the best way for them to try to plan and export their brand of hatred and extremism around the globe. That's why the President has always made a priority of increasing the pressure against ISIL leaders in Iraq and in Syria.\nAnd the most high-profile of the attacks that we have seen outside of Iraq and in Syria have been in Western Europe. And there's been extensive reporting about the likely ties between the plotters in Western Europe and the leading ISIL figures in Iraq and in Syria.\nSo that's why it's important for us to continue to ramp up the pressure in Iraq and in Syria. You've heard me talk about this in different contexts. If the leaders of that organization are feeling intense pressure to protect their own safety and security, that's less time and attention that they're devoting to their external activities.\nThat being said, I think a potential consequence of increasing pressure on ISIL in Iraq and in Syria is that they will become more focused on activities outside of that region, even if their capacity to carry them out is diminished. That's why we remain vigilant. And that's why, even as we're ramping up the pressure in Iraq and in Syria -- and Ambassador Rice documented some of the progress that we've made there, too -- that's why, even though we've made important progress, and even though we do expect that that will have some impact -- positive impact in diminishing their capacity to carry out external attacks -- we're going to continue to be vigilant about protecting and countering those external attacks, because as they face more pressure in Iraq and in Syria, they're going to be more desperate to undertake operations in other places.\nQ: So what you're saying is you expect to see even more of these as the pressure --\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm trying to say is that's why I think that while those numbers are an illustration of the threat that ISIL poses outside of Iraq and in Syria, they're not a good way to measure how dangerous ISIL is. Because even as they face more pressure and even as their capabilities are diminished, they're still going to seek to carry out external plots -- in fact, because they're under so much pressure in Syria and Iraq.\nAnd so that's the complicated dynamic that exists. And it explains the strategy that we have pursued, which is to continue to ramp up the pressure in Iraq and in Syria, and to continue to seek to enhance our ability to work with our partners in the region and around the world to counter their activities outside of that region.\nQ: Okay. Just quickly, did the President watch the Democratic debate last night?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not spoken to the President about the debate this morning, but I do not anticipate that he watched it.\nQ: Did you watch the debate last night?\nMR. EARNEST: I saw parts of it, but I certainly did not watch all of it.\nQ: Does the White House feel that Hillary Clinton should turn over the transcripts of her speeches that she gave to Wall Street?\nMR. EARNEST: I can confidently tell you that the White House does not have an opinion on this.\nQ: I mean, you're always talking about transparency and how important it is. And she, being the leading candidate to be the next President right now on the Democratic side --\nMR. EARNEST: I certainly do believe in transparency, and I certainly do believe that when it comes to the government of the United States of America that is funded by taxpayers, that public servants do have a responsibility to be transparent about their official government activities. But obviously, none of that is an accurate description of the situation that was at the crux of a disagreement in the debate last night. So I'll let Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders explain their respective positions.\nQ: So you don't feel either way whether she should release them or not?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't feel the need to weigh in on it. Again, they can both have that argument and explain their positions, and the voters will decide who they believe is making the more effective argument.\nMary.\nQ: Back on Zika funding. Despite the answers that you've already provided to some of the Republicans' questions, we seem to be at a bit of a standstill here. Chairman Rogers says --\nMR. EARNEST: Dangerously so.\nQ: -- this simply is not enough. He says he needs more specifics, and until then, they can't take any further action. Will you provide them with any more details?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I have indicated from the beginning a desire to engage in a conversation with members of Congress to take the steps that are necessary now to protect the American people from the Zika virus. And this is not a new position for the administration; this is actually a position that we've held since February when the President initially asked for the additional funding to fight Zika.\nSince that time, there have been a number of senior administration officials who have gone to Capitol Hill to testify before committees on camera, under oath, answering questions from members of Congress, including the Appropriations Committee repeatedly, people like Secretary Burwell. She's obviously the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. She has testified before Congress on a number of occasions, including March 15th. She testified also on February 25th. And she testified before both the House and the Senate -- once on March 24th and March 25th.\nAnd I can tell you that Tony Fauci, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, testified before Congress repeatedly to discuss this issue. In fact, there are 48 hearings over the course of this year where the Zika virus has come up. So there has been not just a willingness on the part of the administration to engage in this conversation, you've seen senior administration officials actually go up to Congress and make themselves available to answer questions on camera, under oath, about this issue.\nThe Republican explanation for not acting on Zika is that they didn't do their homework. They've had ample opportunity to collect information, to ask questions of senior administration officials, to read letters, to read the legislative proposal that was put forward by the administration. But Republicans haven't done it. I don't understand really why.\nI don't know if it's that they are concerned about the reaction from the extreme right-wing base of their party about additional government funding. I don't know if it's the need that Republicans for some reason feel to reflexively oppose everything that President Obama suggests. What I do know is that the Republican approach thus far to not take any action to provide the funding that our public health experts say is necessary is bad for the country, and it's dangerous.\nQ: So when Republicans, for instance, say that the details they're still looking for -- one of them is the exact dollar amount that they need right now in this fiscal year -- you say that they already had an opportunity to get those kinds of answers?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Secretary Burwell has testified on a number of occasions about the President's budget. She testified before the House Appropriations Committee on February 25th about the budget. There certainly was an opportunity for Republicans to ask her there. Why didn't they? Were they not prepared to do so? Did they not think of it at the time? I guess it would be worth asking them. She testified before the Committee on education and the workforce. Somebody presumably could have asked her there. That was a more recent hearing. That occurred on March 15th.\nI think what is more likely happening is that we are seeing Republicans change their explanation for their inaction. They are grasping in the dark for an excuse. Several weeks ago, you heard Speaker Ryan say, \"There's plenty of money in the pipeline right now that can go to Zika.\" That was the explanation from Speaker Ryan a few weeks ago. Earlier this week, he said -- Speaker Ryan said that funding for Zika should go through the normal process. Considering that today is the deadline for the House to pass a budget, and they're not going to meet that deadline, I'm not sure that pursuing the normal process for an emergency like this, given Congress's inept ability to handle the budget, is a particularly good idea.\nSo that's why I think it's a little curious after weeks of saying there's plenty of money in the pipeline, or there's plenty of time for us to act, that Republicans are now somehow saying that they don't have enough information. I don't think that really passes the smell test.\nQ: And given the fact that it's obviously getting warmer by the day, are you confident that this fight is going to get the funding that it needs?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, our success to do -- well, let me say it this way, our public health professionals stood at this podium on Monday -- it seems like a while ago -- they stood at this podium on Monday, and they said that they don't have what they need right now, that they're not doing everything that we should be doing right now to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\nThere is a lot that can be done. It requires reprogramming funds from other core priorities. It required trying to extract loose change from the proverbial couch. But there is important work that's being done at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control to try to fight this disease, and to try to fight the virus, and to try to protect the American people.\nBut we're not doing everything that we should be doing. We're certainly not doing everything that we could be doing if Congress would fulfill its basic responsibility to ensure that these public health professionals have the resources that they need to protect the American people. This is separate from the kind of basic funding that we need to ensure that state and local governments can respond to the situation, too. After all, they're the ones that are going to be on the front lines.\nWe know that additional funding would help local governments fight the mosquito population. One of the things that we have heard that they're interested in doing -- and this is something that the CDC discussed with state and local officials in Atlanta a couple of weeks ago -- is that when there is someone who has tested positive for the Zika virus, one of the things that it would make sense to do is to go around that person's house in that neighborhood and try to kill all the mosquitos that are living there, to prevent that person from being bitten by a mosquito and transmitting the virus to someone else. But that's going to require a local government response that's very nimble and that has enough capacity to be able to dedicate a couple of people to go a couple of hours and spray around one house.\nThat requires resources. That, of course, is not the kind mosquito eradication plan that's in place right now. So if we're going to be able to make those kinds of smart, strategic, and tactical decisions to fight this virus, we're going to need additional funding. And that funding is not going to be available until somebody -- until Republicans in Congress begin to recognize that this is a basic responsibility that they have and that the safety and security and wellbeing of the American people depends upon them doing their jobs.\nJustin.\nQ: Would the White House be willing to accept the version of the Puerto Rico legislation that reduced Puerto Rico's minimum wage?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess, Justin, I'd be hard-pressed to hear a Republican explain how exactly that's going to improve the financial standing of the Puerto Rico government. That sounds much more to me like Republicans engaging in a tactic that we've seen from them before, which is hoping that they can score an unrelated, ideological victory by holding something else hostage. In this case, it's the liquidity of the Puerto Rican government.\nSo there is no reason that we should let a longstanding political argument about the minimum wage have an impact on the ability of the Puerto Rican government to pay its bills. So just to be clear -- because there does seem to be some misinformation that's being spread about this -- this is not a bailout. I've said many times the administration does not support a bailout of Puerto Rico. We don't. We haven't. We have never, and we don't now.\nThe irony is, is that refusing to give the Puerto Rican government authority to address their financial challenges right now only make a future bailout of Puerto Rico more likely. So if we actually are focused on trying to prevent a bailout from being necessary, then Congress needs to continue to act in a bipartisan fashion to find a solution that will just give Puerto Rico the kind of debt restructuring authority that cities across the country have. And that by using that authority in a way that does have some oversight to make sure that they're pursuing reforms, that's the best way to ensure -- to restore the financial situation on the island of Puerto Rico and make sure that U.S. taxpayers are not placed on the hook of ever bailing them out.\nQ: So is that a no?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it is a -- well, yes, it's a no because it has nothing to do with --\nQ: We'll, get you to your meeting on time. (Laughter.) Have you guys been in contact with bondholders on this issue? I know you kind of mentioned them as part of the undergraduate political science class earlier this week. And so I'm wondering if -- you obviously have been in touch with Congress, and the Treasury Department has even talking to bondholders -- but has the Treasury been talking to bondholders?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific conversations that occurred. But I do know that when faced with public policy questions, it's not uncommon for the administration to be in touch with stakeholders on a variety of sides. So I wouldn't rule out that a meeting with bondholders has occurred at some point. But I'm not aware of any specific meetings.\nQ: Leader Pelosi said yesterday that she doesn't think that this legislation -- especially after the markup got kind of scrapped or pushed back -- has a chance of passing by May 1st. May 2nd, I guess, is when the $422 million payment is due. Do you agree with that assessment that you don't expect this legislation to now pass by the end of the month? And if so, what are the ramifications that you see for Puerto Rico?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Leader Pelosi is certainly in a better position to assess the likelihood of the timely passage of this legislation than I am. I haven't heard that assessment, but I don't -- again, I don't have the standing or the knowledge to disagree with her assessment.\nI think this is why the administration has been focused, since last year, you'll recall, in trying to get Congress to act to avoid a cliffhanger like the one that you're describing. I don't know what consequences this will have for Puerto Rico's ability to make that payment on time. But obviously it's a good illustration of why we're concerned about this situation.\nQ: And last one was kind of the debate last night. You've talked a lot about how the tone of the Democratic race and debate has been heightened relative to the Republican one. But last night we saw kind of some real scrapping between the Democratic candidates. I'm wondering if that bled into a territory where it raised any concern within the White House, or if there were any plans to maybe ask the candidates to cool things down to sort of maintain that perceived difference?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any plan to begin to communicate with the candidates about the strategy that they've chosen to pursue. I still feel confident -- well, I didn't watch every minute of the debate -- I do still feel confident in saying that the tone and tenor and focus on policy in the Democratic debate has positioned the Democratic Party to do well in the general election, particularly because we've seen a Democratic race that's been focused on a whole lot of things other than substantive policy issues. So I'm not aware of any conversations like that that are contemplated.\nI do continue to believe, and I know the President continues to believe, that a robust debate in a Democratic primary is not necessarily a bad thing. It certainly is a way for Democratic voters across the country to become more engaged in the debate, and that will pay dividends in the general election. It certainly did in 2008, when we had a primary that lasted longer than expected. And there certainly is a potential that that would happen again in 2016.\nRon.\nQ: On the Clinton speeches issue, you won't take a position about whether she should disclose these transcripts. Is there concern at the White House that this issue could hurt her in a general election? The charge essentially is hypocrisy of her making these speeches, being paid a lot of money, but yet at the same time claiming that she is an agent of change and that she is against some of the practices on Wall Street, and so on and so forth.\nMR. EARNEST: I think the short answer to your question is no. But obviously, it's possible that this is an issue that could come up for some discussion in the general election. But again, right now, there's a Democratic primary that's going on. And it's not clear exactly who the party's nominee is going to be. Obviously, Secretary Clinton, based on her success in amassing delegates, has the lead. But this process has not yet been resolved.\nQ: And just in terms of the administration's position on former employees, if you will, leaving and going out and making money, is there anything about what the Secretary has done that concerns the administration on this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any concerns that have been raised. I know that there were a set of policies that were put in place on the President's first or second day in office that did limit the activities of former administration officials. That mostly related to former administration officials who might be interested in coming back and lobbying their former colleagues. We can certainly get you some more details around that, because the kinds of restrictions to close that revolving door that President Obama put in place were the toughest in history. But I don't think that those regulations would apply to the situation that Secretary Clinton faced.\nQ: Something else in the news -- there's a lot of attention focused on a case in Atlanta involving a boy who's being paddled at an elementary school outside of Atlanta. Are you familiar with that?\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen a little bit of the coverage but I've not looked at the details.\nQ: Aside from the details of that situation, what is the President's view generally about corporal punishment in schools?\nMR. EARNEST: I have to admit, I have not heard the President express an opinion on this. We can take a look and see if the President has weighed in on it in the past. But I think it is certainly understandable that an issue like this would get a lot of attention, but I'm not sure that the President has weighed in on it.\nQ: And just lastly, one other thing about last night as well. Hillary Clinton said -- and I believe Senator Sanders said as well -- that they support the idea of safe havens in Turkey in the Syrian war theater. And I know the President has said he doesn't think that that's a way to go. But he's going there, he's talking to Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, who also, I believe, supports this notion. And I'm wondering if this might be a time to rethink that because, as you've said, you've taken back so much territory from ISIS, there is a cessation of hostilities in place that's somewhat fragile, that one of the big objectives now is to get more humanitarian aid into that environment. So why not look at something like that, that people like former Secretary Clinton and Chancellor Merkel, who, I believe the President both has a lot of respect for, support? Why not take a look at something like that now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say this -- let me answer that question a couple different ways. The first is that the United States has worked hard with the United Nations and the rest of the international community to try to impose a Cessation of Hostilities. And this is a Cessation of Hostilities that went into effect two months ago now. It has proved to be more durable than I think most administration officials expected, that's for sure. And having that Cessation of Hostilities in place has reduced the violence and has allowed humanitarian organizations to do more of their important work in some communities that have been desperate for it for a while now. So we have made important progress in that regard.\nThe President's longstanding opposition to this concept of a so-called \"safe zone\" in Syria is predicated on the idea that while it sounds good, it's much more complicated in practice to implement it. It raises all sorts of questions about who exactly would ensure the safety of the safe zone. That presumably would require the deployment of thousands of military personnel in order to not just guard the perimeter, but also to screen the individuals and equipment and vehicles that are entering the safe zone. And it also would require the deployment of security personnel inside the safe zone to ensure the security of all those who are there.\nThat, in essence, would require the kind of commitment of ground forces that the President does not believe is consistent with our national security interests. And some people have referred to this as a no-fly zone, and the reason that that's misleading is we know that ISIL isn't carrying out attacks from the air. So it's not the no-fly zone that we're concerned about. It's unclear exactly how much safety and security that would bring anybody, because the situation on the ground is where the security is so unstable. And trying to secure and patrol and, in some cases, be in the position of repelling attacks over such a large territorial area would not be consistent with our national security interests.\nQ: I guess the concern is that now would be a time, some would argue, for a very bold humanitarian gesture. And clearly, the U.S. military can sort that out, the logistics of doing it, and there may be coalition partners who are willing to -- I don't know the troop numbers -- but I think it's the concept that given what's happened in Syria and the horrific humanitarian disaster that it is, why not now when there seems to be a window, or seems to be some progress? I mean, I thought it terms of humanitarian aid, I thought your view was that not enough is getting in. There's some progress, but I thought the view of the administration was that there still needs to be more done on that front.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there certainly is more that can and should be done on that front. But more humanitarian assistance has been provided over the last couple of months than was provided previously because of the successful implementation of the Cessation of Hostilities. The implementation of that cessation has not been perfect by any stretch. We have seen violations, but it has proved to be more durable than was previously expected. And that has given humanitarian aid organizations greater freedom to provide much-needed relief to populations that have been caught in the crossfire for quite some time.\nSo that is the strategy that we have been pursuing. That also is a strategy that will move us more closely in the direction of our goal, which is ultimately resolving the political chaos inside of Syria. By reaching a Cessation of Hostilities, we can not just provide some humanitarian relief, but we can also give political opponents of the regime confidence that they can begin to engage in the proximity talks hosted by the United Nations to bring about a political solution inside of Syria. And that is ultimately going to solve our problem.\nThe creation of a safe zone doesn't move us in the direction of any of that, and in fact, actually, could move us in a direction of starting to partition Syria. And the United States and others who have been focused on the situation in Syria have made it a goal to try to preserve the current shape of that nation, even as they endure so much turmoil right now.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The President said about this set-top box issue that he wanted to lend greater lift to the push to get more federal agencies to explore areas of possible competition. Sixty days seems like a pretty tight window. Has he issued a similar challenge to other federal agencies previously?\nMR. EARNEST: Off the top of my head, I can't think of one that had a specific 60-day timeframe, but we can take a look at that for you. And obviously the goal here is that in some cases it might be pretty obvious to agencies that this kind of anti-competitive behavior is going on. And I think the President wanted to make clear that it's a priority to find a way to address it. And the consequences for doing so are significant. By trying to promote greater competition in the market, we can do things that have obvious benefits for consumers.\nWhen it comes to set-top boxes, people are spending hundreds of dollars a year to essentially rent a box that cost less than that to make in the first place. And the only reason that they have to rent that box from their cable provider is because that's what the cable provider requires in order to get the signal. So if we can standardize the signal, allow other companies to provide the box, it then means that cable companies are just providing the service. That could cut costs. That could also enhance innovation. Those set-top boxes are occasionally clunky and have to be replaced in their own right anyway. So it probably is an area of technology where innovation would be good for consumers, to say nothing of the broader impact it could have on the economy if you can give other companies the opportunity to develop products that would allow them to compete with the big cable providers.\nQ: So then what would you say to the industry critics who suggest it could actually drive up costs in the short run on consumers? What's wrong with their thought on that? Are they being disingenuous when they make that suggestion?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't heard the justification for that claim. But again, it already is prohibitively expensive for many consumers, based on the way that it's currently structured.\nAgain, over the course of the year, you can often pay more to rent that box than it actually costs to build that box in the first place. So, yes, it's a pretty inefficient process, and it's one that allows cable companies to stifle innovation and collect significant sums of money. This is a place where innovation and competition can be good for the broader economy and good for individual consumers. It certainly is a way for us to be more fair when it comes to cable customers who are looking for a good deal.\nQ: What about the concern that this is another example of more government reach-in in an area where it shouldn't reach in?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think this is an example of the government saying, we're not going to let you have a specific benefit anymore. Now, this is an independent decision that's made by the FCC, so they'll ultimately have to decide. But ultimately, I think this is about --\nQ: Will the FTC also be involved in that, too?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is this is an FCC decision and not an FTC one. But the FTC obviously does have a regulatory role that in some cases does have to deal with combatting anticompetitive behavior in a way that's good for innovation and good for consumers. But in this case, it's the FCC that's involved.\nBut look, the question here is whether or not we're going to do more to empower customers and give them a choice. And when given a choice, there is obvious potential that they could save money and get better service. So this I think, on the scale of policy questions to be made by the government, this one seems like a rather easy one.\nGregory.\nQ: Following up on that, on Wednesday, the National Association of Broadcasters filed a petition with the FCC asking for permission to broadcast next-generation TV signals that would allow them to do things like interactive things, mobile TV, 4K video. Would you envision the White House would weigh in on that proposal as well? And if not, what's the difference between the one disruptive technology that you do support and the other disruptive technology that you don't?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen their specific proposal. I don't know at this point whether or not we'd weigh in on it. Obviously, it's something that will be carefully considered by the FCC. But at this point, I'm not aware of a plan to weigh on that specific proposal.\nQ: Michael Powell, the former Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said that this decision was political on the part of the White House. And he points out that the companies that would benefit the most from the set-box rule are companies like Google, Amazon, Netflix. Those are all companies that have participated in these private sector commitments on various initiatives the White House has with the President's pen-and-phone strategy. Care to comment on whether this is a political favor to those companies?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the thing that I would simply observe -- and this is something that Mr. Powell obviously knows -- the people who stand to benefit the most are consumers, millions of them across the country who right now are being charged an unfair price for their cable service. That is what's driving the President -- that's what's driving the decision of the administration and the President to state an opinion on this.\nBut of course this decision will be made by the FCC, and they will do so without weighing what other policy areas the potentially affected companies have been involved in.\nQ: And then Kevin asked about the 60-day deadline for the executive order today. In January, the President issued a presidential memorandum on smart gun technology that had a 90-day deadline for departments to get back to the White House on what they could do on smart gun technology. It's been two weeks since that deadline. Has the President received that report? And why hasn't it been released?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't been briefed on that particular executive order. We can certainly look into it. I would be surprised, given the priority that the administration has placed on that executive order, if any agencies were late. But we'll take a look, and if there's information we can provide to you on it, we will.\nBill.\nQ: There is a report said to be from reliable sources that next week Secretary Lew plans to announce that he will leave Hamilton on the $10 bill, put some women on the back, and leave Jackson on the $20. Have you heard?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there's been substantial reporting around this. I don't have any secrets to reveal from here. What I can tell you is that --\nQ: Does this sound reasonable?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the reasonableness of a proposal like the one you described is probably in the eye of the beholder. I think what I would say is that Secretary Lew has demonstrated a seriousness of purpose in taking a look at what the next generation of U.S. currency would look like. Obviously, there are updates that are made to our currency based on security requirements. And the question that he has considered is when those security updates are required, should we make some changes to our currency to make sure that it better reflects the country, and certainly the role that women have played in contributing to the development of our country.\nAnd he has indicated that that look will result in changes being made not just to the $10, but to the $5 and the $20. But beyond that, we'll have to wait for an announcement from the Treasury Department.\nQ: So what do you think, women on the currency would make it more secure?\nMR. EARNEST: No, what I'm saying is that -- I guess that's possible, but that's not the decision. The decision is that every 10 years or so, there are updates that are made to the features of our currency to counter counterfeiters. And so that often involves the redesign of the currency, and Secretary Lew has suggested that in the context of that redesign, that ensuring that our currency better reflects the country could be a worthwhile thing.\nBut for the details of what that could look like, we'll have to wait for an announcement from the Treasury Department.\nFred.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. First of all, on the executive action -- or executive orders going forward looking at competition, first of all, why now in terms of looking at this? I mean, whatever report comes back, do you think that the President's successor will take all those recommendations and implement those?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think I would say two things about that. I think the first is, the President is hopeful that in the next 60 days, agencies may surface ideas that we could act on relatively quickly, including before the end of the administration. I don't want to prejudge exactly what agencies will turn up when they conduct this review, but if it's possible to make changes in short order that would better promote competition, we certainly would be supportive of moving forward with those.\nIf there are proposals that are put forward that would take longer to implement, we certainly will. In some cases, it's possible for us to initiate the process now and let the President's successor decide on how to implement it. In other cases, we may just use them to pass on recommendations of obvious steps that the next administration could take to promote better competition in a way that will provide more of an incentive for innovation and obvious benefits to our broader economy and to consumers.\nQ: And would you anticipate the findings are going to lean towards more regulation or less regulation? Or is it going to be sort of a combination?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the question here is less about more regulation versus less regulation, and more about what can we do to provide the market with an incentive to pursue more competition and more innovation and more savings for consumers, and more economic growth and economic expansion?\nThat's the direction that we're headed in. And I think typically that does mean, in some cases, responsible decisions about reducing regulations. It's not always the case, but it often is. But again, I don't want to prejudge what the conclusions of the agency review might be.\nQ: And I want to talk about the story that came up on Fox News just. There are Marine officials who have said that the aviation corps is being stretched to a breaking point because of budget cuts, sequestration, and so forth, over the last five years. Is this a concern in terms of having enough planes that are ready to prepare to go to battle?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak -- I can't provide an update for you in terms of the current condition of the air wing of the Marine Corps. I can tell you in general that we've been quite concerned about the approach that Congress has taken to funding our defense priorities.\nThere has been a willingness on the part of Republicans to champion the sequester that has had a negative impact on our ability to fund core defense programs. We have been concerned that too many Republicans have been tempted to use something like OCO funding to try to make up for those differences. When you're talking about ensuring the long-term strength of the aircraft that are used by the United States Marines, that requires a sustained investment and can't be funded on a six-month or 12-month basis. And that's why OCO funding is not an acceptable replacement for draconian, unwise, sequester-motivated spending cuts that Republicans have in some cases championed.\nSo the other thing that we have often been concerned about is there are legitimate places where defense spending can be cut from programs that the military has concluded that they don't need or are not particularly effective. And using those resources to increase our investment in those areas that we know are particularly effective is smart budgeting. Those are the kinds of budgetary decisions that middle-class families make around the kitchen table every day, or at least every month.\nAnd it's unfortunate that too many Republicans have blocked those kinds of common-sense defense-spending reforms that would have obvious benefits for the readiness of our military.\nQ: And last question -- yesterday, you talked about being undefeated in the WTO against China. I know you love Trump questions. I mean, his constant campaign meme has been \"U.S. always loses to China; China always wins.\" Do you think that blunts his point, or absolutely refutes his point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let you guys try to figure out exactly what his point is. It's not always immediately obvious.\nI think what is true is that this administration's record of fighting for American businesses and American workers at the WTO is incredibly strong. And that's not just true when you take a look at the number of cases that the United States has brought against China at the WTO, it's true when looking at the results of those cases.\nAll of the cases that have been decided are cases that were decided in favor of the United States. And it is an indication that the United States can be effective and is effective in defending American businesses. That's why the President has made a strong case that what we should do is actually look for additional markets where we can level the playing field, where we can fight unfair competition, where we can force other countries to raise their labor standards, to raise their environmental standards, and to raise their human rights standards and give more American companies more access to their markets.\nIn some cases we're talking about countries that have dynamic economies, they're growing quickly, and they would benefit from American products. And they have a large number of customers who are hungry for American products. Why wouldn't we look for opportunities to provide that access to American businesses in a way that we know will be good for workers and good for our economy, particularly if we have demonstrated an ability to protect those American businesses and those American companies from the unfair practices that are used by other countries?\nSo this is a lot about common sense. And the facts of this case and the facts of this policy debate are often rather inconvenient to the most vociferous critics of this policy. And I'm not just referring to presidential candidates. I'm also referring to individual members of Congress in both parties.\nVictoria, I'll give you the last one, then we'll do the week ahead.\nQ: I understand that your position is that the Republicans are posturing over the details that they want with regard to Zika funding. But why don't you just call their bluff and provide the details? Obviously, the officials at the CDC and everywhere else know exactly what it is that they need. Why don't they just go ahead and provide those details?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess, Victoria, the case that I'm making to you is that we have. We provided --\nQ: Again.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll give it to you. Do you want to pass it off to them? It's right here, dated February 22nd, legislative language, specific text. There have also been a number of hearings, 48 of them in which the Zika virus has come up. These are hearings, including testimony before the House Appropriations Committee. This includes testimony by Dr. Fauci, it includes testimony by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Burwell. So there is ample information that's been shared. Many of you received a letter that the Director of the OMB, Shaun Donovan, sent up to Congress a couple of weeks ago. There is extensive information that's been provided.\nQ: Are you unwilling to send it again?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: Are you unwilling to provide it again?\nMR. EARNEST: If necessary, we're happy to resend as many letters as Republicans claim got lost in the mail.\nQ: Because I've already killed mosquitos in my Maryland apartment.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. (Laughter.)\nQ: They're here.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, they are. And it is a risk that we are aware of and one that we have a unique opportunity to try to get in front of. There are a lot of preparations that we can make before the biggest threat arrives.\nWe know that there is a specific species of mosquito that carries this virus. That's the one that we're most acutely concerned about. We know that that an expansion of diagnostic testing would serve the American people well.\nRight now, that testing has to be limited because our capacity is rather limited, to say nothing of how we could turbocharge the development of a vaccine that, while it probably couldn't be ready to protect people this year, certainly could be in place to start protecting people next year. Those are the kinds of basic actions that we'd like to undertake. But yet, we cannot do as much as we possibly can in pursuit of those goals until Congress actually provides the necessary funding.\nQ: Josh, quick question. This regards to your week ahead -- I don't think you may get to this in your week ahead. On Monday, a major case is coming before the U.S. Supreme Court. It's U.S. v. Texas. What confidence do you have that the administration will prevail at the Supreme Court-level when you haven't prevailed at both the district court-level and the appellate court-level?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I am not going to be in a position to predict outcomes. But I do feel confident in saying that we've got a lot of confidence in the strength of our argument that we'll make before the Supreme Court. It is quite clear that the executive authority that President Obama exercised is entirely consistent with the executive authority that President Reagan and President George H.W. Bush exercised in carrying out and enforcing our immigration policy.\nIt also happens to make common sense. We've got limited enforcement resources. We should target those resources at the most dangerous people. And that is exactly what our policy recommends. And there are significant economic and fiscal benefits to pursuing this policy. And we're hopeful that the power of these arguments will prevail, but we'll see.\nQ: Does it make it more difficult with just eight justices on the U.S. Supreme Court hearing that case?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it does mean that the Supreme Court is not going to function in the way that -- with the full complement of justices. It's President Reagan who talked about how that was a bad idea. We certainly agree with that sentiment.\nLet me do the week ahead, and I'll let you go, and I'll get back to my meeting here.\nOn Monday, the President will be here at White House. I do not anticipate that he'll have much of a public schedule that day.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the President will depart Washington, D.C., en route Ramstein, Germany, where he will refuel on his way to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nOn Wednesday, the President will arrive in Riyadh. In the afternoon, the President will meet with King Salman of Saudi Arabia. The President will spend the night in Riyadh.\nOn Thursday, the President will meet with leaders and delegations from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. For those of you scoring along at home, that's Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. In the afternoon, the President will depart Riyadh and travel to London where he will remain overnight.\nOn Friday, the President I know is eagerly looking forward to having lunch with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom at Windsor Castle. Next week is obviously the Queen's 90th birthday. So the President was looking forward to the opportunity to wish her a happy birthday then.\nIn the afternoon, the President will have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom. Afterward, the President and Prime Minister will participate in a news conference. The President will spend Friday night in London.\nOn Saturday, the President will participate in a town hall discussion with British youth at the Royal Horticultural Halls. That should be an interesting venue. The President will spend Saturday night in London, as well.\nOn Sunday, the President will debate London and head to Hannover, Germany. In Hannover, the President will have a bilateral meeting with Chancellor Merkel. Afterward, the President and Chancellor Merkel will host a news conference.\nOn Sunday evening, the President will deliver remarks at the Hannover Messe Trade Fair opening ceremony. Later in the evening, the President will host a dinner with Chancellor Merkel and business leaders from both the United States and Germany who are attending the Hannover Messe. The President will spend Sunday night in Hannover.\nThe President does have a schedule in Germany on Monday, but will depart Germany on Monday afternoon and head back to the United States, arriving here Monday evening East Coast time.\nAll right, with that, I hope you guys all have a good weekend. Enjoy the beautiful spring weather, and we'll see you on Monday.\nEND 1:17 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-04-15", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117194", "text": "I am honored to be with you today and was pleased to receive your invitation to speak to this conference of The Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. Today we celebrate the encyclical Centesimus Annus and reflect on its meaning for our world a quarter-century after it was presented by Pope John Paul II. With the fall of Communism, Pope John Paul II gave a clarion call for human freedom in its truest sense: freedom that defends the dignity of every person and that is always oriented towards the common good.\nThe Church's social teachings, stretching back to the first modern encyclical about the industrial economy, Rerum Novarum in 1891, to Centesimus Annus, to Pope Francis's inspiring encyclical Laudato Si' this past year, have grappled with the challenges of the market economy. There are few places in modern thought that rival the depth and insight of the Church's moral teachings on the market economy.\nOver a century ago, Pope Leo XIII highlighted economic issues and challenges in Rerum Novarum that continue to haunt us today, such as what he called \"the enormous wealth of a few as opposed to the poverty of the many.\"\nAnd let us be clear. That situation is worse today. In the year 2016, the top one percent of the people on this planet own more wealth than the bottom 99 percent, while the wealthiest 60 people – 60 people – own more than the bottom half – 3 1/2 billion people. At a time when so few have so much, and so many have so little, we must reject the foundations of this contemporary economy as immoral and unsustainable.\nThe words of Centesimus Annus likewise resonate with us today. One striking example:\nFurthermore, society and the State must ensure wage levels adequate for the maintenance of the worker and his family, including a certain amount for savings. This requires a continuous effort to improve workers' training and capability so that their work will be more skilled and productive, as well as careful controls and adequate legislative measures to block shameful forms of exploitation, especially to the disadvantage of the most vulnerable workers, of immigrants and of those on the margins of society. The role of trade unions in negotiating minimum salaries and working conditions is decisive in this area. (Para15)\nThe essential wisdom of Centesimus Annus is this: A market economy is beneficial for productivity and economic freedom. But if we let the quest for profits dominate society; if workers become disposable cogs of the financial system; if vast inequalities of power and wealth lead to marginalization of the poor and the powerless; then the common good is squandered and the market economy fails us. Pope John Paul II puts it this way: profit that is the result of \"illicit exploitation, speculation, or the breaking of solidarity among working people . . . has not justification, and represents an abuse in the sight of God and man.\" (Para43).\nWe are now twenty-five years after the fall of Communist rule in Eastern Europe. Yet we have to acknowledge that Pope John Paul's warnings about the excesses of untrammeled finance were deeply prescient. Twenty-five years after Centesimus Annus, speculation, illicit financial flows, environmental destruction, and the weakening of the rights of workers is far more severe than it was a quarter century ago. Financial excesses, indeed widespread financial criminality on Wall Street, played a direct role in causing the world's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\nWe need a political analysis as well as a moral and anthropological analysis to understand what has happened since 1991. We can say that with unregulated globalization, a world market economy built on speculative finance burst through the legal, political, and moral constraints that had once served to protect the common good. In my country, home of the world's largest financial markets, globalization was used as a pretext to deregulate the banks, ending decades of legal protections for working people and small businesses. Politicians joined hands with the leading bankers to allow the banks to become \"too big to fail.\" The result: eight years ago the American economy and much of the world was plunged into the worst economic decline since the 1930s. Working people lost their jobs, their homes and their savings, while the government bailed out the banks.\nInexplicably, the United States political system doubled down on this reckless financial deregulation, when the U.S. Supreme Court in a series of deeply misguided decisions, unleashed an unprecedented flow of money into American politics. These decisions culminated in the infamous Citizen United case, which opened the financial spigots for huge campaign donations by billionaires and large corporations to turn the U.S. political system to their narrow and greedy advantage. It has established a system in which billionaires can buy elections. Rather than an economy aimed at the common good, we have been left with an economy operated for the top 1 percent, who get richer and richer as the working class, the young and the poor fall further and further behind. And the billionaires and banks have reaped the returns of their campaign investments, in the form of special tax privileges, imbalanced trade agreements that favor investors over workers, and that even give multinational companies extra-judicial power over governments that are trying to regulate them.\nBut as both Pope John Paul II and Pope Francis have warned us and the world, the consequences have been even direr than the disastrous effects of financial bubbles and falling living standards of working-class families. Our very soul as a nation has suffered as the public lost faith in political and social institutions. As Pope Francis has stated: \"Man is not in charge today, money is in charge, money rules.\" And the Pope has also stated: \"We have created new idols. The worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly humane goal.\"\nAnd further: \"While the income of a minority is increasing exponentially, that of the majority is crumbling. This imbalance results from ideologies which uphold the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation, and thus deny the right of control to States, which are themselves charged with providing for the common good.\"\nPope Francis has called on the world to say: \"No to a financial system that rules rather than serves\" in Evangeli Gaudium. And he called upon financial executives and political leaders to pursue financial reform that is informed by ethical considerations. He stated plainly and powerfully that the role of wealth and resources in a moral economy must be that of servant, not master.\nThe widening gaps between the rich and poor, the desperation of the marginalized, the power of corporations over politics, is not a phenomenon of the United States alone. The excesses of the unregulated global economy have caused even more damage in the developing countries. They suffer not only from the boom-bust cycles on Wall Street, but from a world economy that puts profits over pollution, oil companies over climate safety, and arms trade over peace. And as an increasing share of new wealth and income goes to a small fraction of those at the top, fixing this gross inequality has become a central challenge. The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great economic issue of our time, the great political issue of our time, and the great moral issue of our time. It is an issue that we must confront in my nation and across the world.\nPope Francis has given the most powerful name to the predicament of modern society: the Globalization of Indifference. \"Almost without being aware of it,\" he noted, \"we end up being incapable of feeling compassion at the outcry of the poor, weeping for other people's pain, and feeling a need to help them, as though all this were someone else's responsibility and not our own.\" We have seen on Wall Street that financial fraud became not only the norm but in many ways the new business model. Top bankers have shown no shame for their bad behavior and have made no apologies to the public. The billions and billions of dollars of fines they have paid for financial fraud are just another cost of doing business, another short cut to unjust profits.\nSome might feel that it is hopeless to fight the economic juggernaut, that once the market economy escaped the boundaries of morality it would be impossible to bring the economy back under the dictates of morality and the common good. I am told time and time again by the rich and powerful, and the mainstream media that represent them, that we should be \"practical,\" that we should accept the status quo; that a truly moral economy is beyond our reach. Yet Pope Francis himself is surely the world's greatest demonstration against such a surrender to despair and cynicism. He has opened the eyes of the world once again to the claims of mercy, justice and the possibilities of a better world. He is inspiring the world to find a new global consensus for our common home.\nI see that hope and sense of possibility every day among America's young people. Our youth are no longer satisfied with corrupt and broken politics and an economy of stark inequality and injustice. They are not satisfied with the destruction of our environment by a fossil fuel industry whose greed has put short term profits ahead of climate change and the future of our planet. They want to live in harmony with nature, not destroy it. They are calling out for a return to fairness; for an economy that defends the common good by ensuring that every person, rich or poor, has access to quality health care, nutrition and education.\nAs Pope Francis made powerfully clear last year in Laudato Si', we have the technology and know-how to solve our problems – from poverty to climate change to health care to protection of biodiversity. We also have the vast wealth to do so, especially if the rich pay their way in fair taxes rather than hiding their funds in the world's tax and secrecy havens- as the Panama Papers have shown.\nThe challenges facing our planet are not mainly technological or even financial, because as a world we are rich enough to increase our investments in skills, infrastructure, and technological know-how to meet our needs and to protect the planet. Our challenge is mostly a moral one, to redirect our efforts and vision to the common good. Centesimus Annus, which we celebrate and reflect on today, and Laudato Si', are powerful, eloquent and hopeful messages of this possibility. It is up to us to learn from them, and to move boldly toward the common good in our time.", "timestamp": "2016-04-15", "title": "Remarks at a Conference Hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences in Vatican City"}

The editors write that Cruz \"has emerged from a crowded field by dint of his fidelity to principles — limited, constitutional government, sound money, free markets, and a strong foreign policy — that couldn't be at higher premium.\"\nSee excerpts below and view the full article here.\nTed Cruz's New York Values\nNew York Sun\nIn the Republican presidential primary in New York, the Sun urges a vote for Senator Ted Cruz. It hasn't been our normal practice to endorse in the primaries, but this year the vote, set for Tuesday, will take on outsized importance as we career toward a contested convention. The junior senator from Texas has emerged from a crowded field by dint of his fidelity to principles — limited, constitutional government, sound money, free markets, and a strong foreign policy — that couldn't be at higher premium. They are the true New York Values.\n…\nThe first thing we are looking for, in any event, is a candidate who grasps, is committed to, and is excited by America's constitutional principles. The Constitution ought to be a unifying instrument; it is, after all, the only thing that all of our legislators, officers, and judges — from the President to the county sheriffs — must be bound by oath to support. Our ideal candidate is someone who thinks in constitutional terms and who references and reveres the principles in our national parchment.\nOn this head, Senator Cruz laps the field. He has done a better job than any other Republican at building a constitutional approach. He has also done a better job on the economy, though we wish that all candidates in both parties would grasp that the bitterness over illegal immigration into America can be permanently addressed only by economic growth. It is not the abundance of labor that has stunted our progress but rather the dead hand of government upon our economy.\nMr. Cruz has put forth a more principled approach to taxes than another fine senator, Marco Rubio. Mr. Cruz's flat tax is more strategic, more equitable, more pro-growth. Both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump would seek the cuts in corporate taxes that have exiled to foreign countries trillions of dollars in corporate reserves. But Mr. Cruz has been far ahead of any other candidate in marking what for us is an essential element restoring American growth and employment — monetary reform.\nThe Texan was the first to declare for sound money. He did this in the Republican debate in Colorado, when the question was put by Rick Santelli. Mr. Cruz declared that the Federal Reserve \"should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.\" Mr. Trump, too, has spoken, en passant, of the virtues of the gold standard. But Mr. Cruz has been actually pursuing monetary reform within the Senate.\n…\nThe American Founders rejected a king. Their republican vision was a democracy in which the business of government is conducted by elected delegates, who are accountable to the law, tempered by an independent judiciary. Millions of Americans sense that the Democrats have become unmoored from the constitutional principles. Mrs. Clinton would re-write the First Amendment; New York, in 1788, ratified the Constitution only on the caveat that a Bill of Rights would be included. Those are the true New York values, and Mr. Cruz has been the most faithful to them in the current campaign.", "timestamp": "2016-04-15", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: New York Sun: Ted Cruz's New York Values"}

Throughout National Park Week, as we celebrate the ways in which our treasured outdoor spaces enrich our lives and uplift our spirits, the National Park Service will again offer free admission to America's National Parks so more people can explore our country's vast natural beauty.\nNational Parks provide unique opportunities to connect with one another and the world around us, and my Administration has encouraged more Americans to take advantage of these wonders. Through the \"Find Your Park\" campaign, we are helping more people visit public lands and landmarks—from State and local parks that capture our Nation's natural beauty to historical sites that offer unparalleled perspectives into our past. Whether breathtaking sceneries or rushing bodies of water, our National Parks have something for everyone—young and old—and I am committed to helping all Americans discover the outdoors and interact with our unique and magical landscapes.\nExposure to the outdoors can stimulate thought and inspiration, and my Administration has been working to provide more of our young people with the opportunity to grow to learn and love our National Parks. We launched the \"Every Kid in a Park\" initiative, giving all fourth grade students and their families free admission to our parks and other Federal lands and waters. Our parks are beloved parts of America, and ensuring their survival for generations to come is imperative, which is why I have acted to protect more public land and water than any President in history—more than 265 million acres—and I have called on the Congress to boost maintenance and modernization of our National Parks so our children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy their magnificence. And because we must protect the one and only planet we have, my Administration will continue working to combat climate change.\nThis week, in honor of the upcoming National Park Service (NPS) centennial and the rich heritage the NPS has helped protect, let us embrace the opportunity to participate in a variety of scientific, artistic, and athletic activities in our National Parks. And together, let us recommit to promoting environmental stewardship and conserving our public lands so all our daughters and sons can experience the grandeur of our outdoor spaces for years to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 16 through April 24, 2016, as National Park Week.

Policy. Maintaining, encouraging, and supporting a fair, efficient, and competitive marketplace is a cornerstone of the American economy. Consumers and workers need both competitive markets and information to make informed choices.\nCertain business practices such as unlawful collusion, illegal bid rigging, price fixing, and wage setting, as well as anticompetitive exclusionary conduct and mergers stifle competition and erode the foundation of America's economic vitality. The immediate results of such conduct—higher prices and poorer service for customers, less innovation, fewer new businesses being launched, and reduced opportunities for workers—can impact Americans in every walk of life.\nCompetitive markets also help advance national priorities, such as the delivery of affordable health care, energy independence, and improved access to fast and affordable broadband. Competitive markets also promote economic growth, which creates opportunity for American workers and encourages entrepreneurs to start innovative companies that create jobs.\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have a proven record of detecting and stopping anticompetitive conduct and challenging mergers and acquisitions that threaten to consolidate markets and reduce competition.\nPromoting competitive markets and ensuring that consumers and workers have access to the information needed to make informed choices must be a shared priority across the Federal Government. Executive departments and agencies can contribute to these goals through, among other things, pro-competitive rulemaking and regulations, and by eliminating regulations that create barriers to or limit competition. Such Government-wide action is essential to ensuring that consumers, workers, startups, small businesses, and farms reap the full benefits of competitive markets.\nSec. 2. Agency Responsibilities. (a) Executive departments and agencies with authorities that could be used to enhance competition (agencies) shall, where consistent with other laws, use those authorities to promote competition, arm consumers and workers with the information they need to make informed choices, and eliminate regulations that restrict competition without corresponding benefits to the American public.\n(b) Agencies shall identify specific actions that they can take in their areas of responsibility to build upon efforts to detect abuses such as price fixing, anticompetitive behavior in labor and other input markets, exclusionary conduct, and blocking access to critical resources that are needed for competitive entry. Behaviors that appear to violate our antitrust laws should be referred to antitrust enforcers at DOJ and the FTC. Such a referral shall not preclude further action by the referring agency against that behavior under that agency's relevant statutory authority.\n(c) Agencies shall also identify specific actions that they can take in their areas of responsibility to address undue burdens on competition. As permitted by law, agencies shall consult with other interested parties to identify ways that the agency can promote competition through pro-competitive rulemaking and regulations, by providing consumers and workers with information they need to make informed choices, and by eliminating regulations that restrict competition without corresponding benefits to the American public.\n(d) Not later than 30 days from the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the National Economic Council an initial list of (1) actions each agency can potentially take to promote more competitive markets; (2) any specific practices, such as blocking access to critical resources, that potentially restrict meaningful consumer or worker choice or unduly stifle new market entrants, along with any actions the agency can potentially take to address those practices; and (3) any relevant authorities and tools potentially available to enhance competition or make information more widely available for consumers and workers.\n(e) Not later than 60 days from the date of this order, agencies shall report to the President, through the Director of the National Economic Council, recommendations on agency-specific actions that eliminate barriers to competition, promote greater competition, and improve consumer access to information needed to make informed purchasing decisions. Such recommendations shall include a list of priority actions, including rulemakings, as well as timelines for completing those actions.\n(f) Subsequently, agencies shall report semi-annually to the President, through the Director of the National Economic Council, on additional actions that they plan to undertake to promote greater competition.\n(g) Sections 2(d), 2(e), and 2(f) of this order do not require reporting of information related to law enforcement policy and activities.\nSec. 3. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(b) Independent agencies are strongly encouraged to comply with the requirements of this order.\n(c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nApril 15, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-04-15", "title": "Executive Order 13725—Steps To Increase Competition and Better Inform Consumers and Workers To Support Continued Growth of the American Economy"}

One of America's greatest strengths is our free market. A thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. It's how we create jobs, expand opportunities, and give everybody a shot at success. It's what's made America the strongest country on Earth.\nThe most essential ingredient in a healthy free market is competition. But right now too many companies are engaging in behaviors that stifle competition, like blocking new competitors from entering the market or limiting the information and options that give consumers real choice. As a consequence, the rest of us pay higher prices for lower quality products and services. Workers receive lower wages than they otherwise would. Small businesses and entrepreneurs can get squeezed out of the market. And none of that is fair or good for our economy.\nThe deck should not be stacked in favor of the wealthiest individuals and the biggest corporations, against working Americans. That's why my administration is doing everything we can to reverse this trend and promote more competition in the marketplace. In addition to enforcing the rules on the books, I've directed Federal agencies to identify anticompetitive behavior in different industries and find new and specific ways to promote competition.\nOne industry that's ripe for change is cable TV. Right now 99 percent of cable and satellite TV customers rent set-top boxes from their providers. According to one survey, this costs households an average of more than $230 per year. We spend some $20 billion to rent these devices. While we have almost unlimited choice in what we watch on television, from traditional programming to online content, there's next to no competition to build a better, user-friendly product that allows you to easily access all this content in one place. So most consumers just rent whatever the cable company offers. Because we have to. That means companies have little incentive to innovate. As a consequence, we need multiple devices and controllers to access content from different sources. That makes no sense. So my administration has encouraged the FCC to remove the barriers to competition that prevent new players from offering innovative cable box options to consumers.\nWe know this works. For years, Americans had to rent our telephones from the phone company. This was a while ago, but when the FCC finally unlocked competition for home phones, the marketplace was flooded with all kinds of phone options with new features and at different price points. Consumers suddenly had many options. And the whole industry moved forward as a result. The same can happen with cable boxes and in dozens of areas of our economy, all of which can make a difference in your everyday life.\nThe bottom line is, competition is good for consumers, workers, businesses, and our economy. So I'm going to keep doing everything I can to make sure that our free market works for everyone. Thanks, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-04-16", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Our Battleground Tracker has her up there by 12 points over Bernie Sanders 52 to 40 percent. And in her adopted home state of New York, she holds on to her 10-point lead; 53 percent of Democratic primary voters say they will support her and 43 percent are going for Bernie Sanders.\nAs for Bernie Sanders' weekend, he is back from his trip to the Vatican, where he met briefly with Pope Francis.\nAnd he joins you us now from New York.\nWelcome, Senator.\nWhat has happened to the Democratic race there? \"The New York Times\" described you having a ferocious performance in the debate this week.\nSANDERS: Ferocious, I'm not quite sure what that word means.\nI think what has happened is that I have become a little bit tired of being beaten up by the negativity of the Clinton campaign. And we're responding in kind. Look, the differences that we have in how we raise money, she has super PACs and raises whole lot of money from Wall Street and other powerful special interests.\nShe is $12 minimum wage. That's not good enough. I am for $15-an-hour minimum wage. Her views on foreign policy, whether it's the war in Iraq, Libya, Syria, are very different than mine. Our views on fracking, whether or not we will have clean water in the United States of America and around the world, are very different than mine.\nSo, I think what we are doing, at least I am doing, is making it's very clear that my views are out there, representing the needs of working families, the middle class. And I am prepared to take on powerful special interests. I don't...[crosstalk]\nDICKERSON: What negativity has got you so irritated from Hillary Clinton?\nSANDERS: Oh, you name it.\nShe came into -- after we had won eight out of nine caucuses and primaries, I think they made it very clear that what their goal was -- and I think I quote appropriately here -- disqualify, defeat and then reunite the party later on. They have gone after us in every single area in a way that just misrepresents my views, the idea that they have said in the past that I attack Planned Parenthood, when I regard Planned Parenthood, for example, as one of the great organizations in this country. I want to expand funding for Planned Parenthood.\nBut on and on it goes. But I think what you are seeing now is the real differences of opinion between Secretary Clinton and myself. And probably most significantly is we raised seven million individual campaign contributions, more than any candidate in American history at this point, averaging $27.\nShe is out there raising money from the wealthy and the powerful, and I think you can judge a candidate based on how you raise money and who you ultimately become dependent upon.\nDICKERSON: Let me ask you about that. In the debate, you were asked to name an example where the money she raised from Wall Street had influenced her, and you didn't offer an example. She said that proved the attack was phony.\nSANDERS: Well, first of all, I did offer an example.\nBut, second of all, let me offer another one now. She voted for a bad bankruptcy piece of legislation which benefited Wall Street, at the expense of the hard-pressed consumers in this country. That's an example.\nBut you never can say, John, just because you vote for something, that that was caused by something else.[crosstalk]\nDICKERSON: But isn't that the implication of what you're offering in the critique of her? Isn't that kind of what you're saying?\nSANDERS: No. No.\nThe broader critique is, after Wall Street's greed and illegal behavior destroyed our economy and drove us into a major recession, in my view, the proper response, and the response of many economists and many Americans, is, look, these people are running a fraudulent operation.\nWe can't trust them. They have too much wealth, they have too much power, too much concentration of ownership. The proper response, my view then, my view today, is break them up. That is not Hillary Clinton's response. That is the best example, but bankruptcy legislation is another piece of legislation where she was on the wrong side of the issue.\nDICKERSON: You have also tied her -- the money she takes to her position on the minimum wage with a tough ad in which you mentioned the $200,000 speech fees that she gets and then that she doesn't support the $15 national minimum wage.\nAren't you kind of fuzzing up what is an economic policy dispute you have with her and making it seem like she's just being stingy?\nSANDERS: No, it's not a question of being stingy.\nIt is, look, if you can go before Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley end up after an hour's work or 20 minutes' work with a $250,000 check, and that is your life, and then refuse to support the fight for $15, the need to have a $15-an-hour national minimum wage, I think you are living in world far removed from where working people are.\nThe truth is the minimum wage today is a starvation wage; $12 an hour for you is not enough. The American people in state after state now are moving to 15 bucks an hour. She's behind the curve.\nDICKERSON: But you are suggesting, Senator...\nSANDERS: And all I'm saying is, maybe if you make $225 in an hour, you maybe don't know what it's like to live on 10 bucks minimum wage, 10 bucks an hour.\nDICKERSON: On the crime bill, there has been a lot of discussed of the -- discussion of the 1994 crime bill, which you voted for, which she supported. Do you regret your support for that crime bill now, in retrospect?\nSANDERS: Look, that bill -- whenever you have a piece of legislation that has -- it's a big bill and lot of stuff in it, it has the Violence Against Women Act, and I -- during my tenure as mayor of Burlington worked very hard against domestic violence and had the ban on assault weapons, something that I believe in fervently -- I believed back in 1988 when I ran for office, believed it on that vote.\nBut there is no debate that that legislation has resulted in massive incarceration, that we today have more people in jail than any other country, that we have a broken criminal justice system. And I am leading the effort now to make certain that we have very strong reforms of the criminal justice system right now.\nPeople are in jail who should not be in jail. We have to prevent people from going into jail. We need a parole system. We need to end the so-called war on drugs, which has resulted in a disproportionate number of African-Americans being arrested. There's an enormous amount of work that has to be done now to address the crisis in criminal justice.\nDICKERSON: Now a quick political question here at the end.\nDonald Trump says the Democratic nomination is stacked against you because of the superdelegates. Do you agree?\nSANDERS: Well, it's not only that.\nI will tell you, the answer is, yes, that we -- Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the establishment. And she has many, many times more superdelegates than we have. But I will tell you something that also is of concern to me. We're going to go -- we're going into Tuesday here. We're fighting hard. I think we have real shot to win on Tuesday if there is a large voter turnout.\nBut even here in New York state, you have a voting system which makes it impossible for independents to participate in the Democratic primary, that makes it impossible for people to register on the day of the election, which many states do, which is going to result in a lower voter turnout than I would like to see.\nBut at the end of the day, because we are defeating Trump by much larger numbers than is Secretary Clinton, in poll after poll, national polls and in state polls, I think lot of these superdelegates are going to conclude that Bernie Sanders is the candidate to prevent what must not be allowed to happen. And that is Donald Trump becoming president of the United States.\nDICKERSON: All right, Bernie Sanders, thanks so much for being with us.\nSANDERS: Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-04-17", "title": "Interview with John Dickerson of CBS News' \"Face the Nation\""}
{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123347", "text": "BASH: Clooney's next-door neighbor, a Sanders supporter, hosted a dueling fund-raiser for him with tickets priced at $27.\nJoining me now is Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\nAnd, Senator Sanders, you heard Clooney there. He almost sounds like he's feeling the Bern. [laughter]\nSANDERS: Well, I have a lot of respect for George Clooney's honesty and integrity on this issue.\nHe is right. One of the great tragedies of American life today is the degree to which big money is buying elections, in which elected officials become responsive to the needs of Wall Street and wealthy campaign contributors, rather than the needs of ordinary people.\nAnd, Dana, I'm so proud that, in this campaign, we have now raised almost seven million individual contributions averaging $27 apiece. That is unprecedented in American history.\nBASH: But you realize, Senator, that he just raised millions of dollars for your opponent. So, is he backing the wrong horse here?\nSANDERS: Well, I think he is. But he is honest enough to say that there is something wrong when few people, in this case wealthy individuals, but in other instances for the secretary, it is Wall Street and powerful special interests, who are able to contribute unbelievably large sums of money.\nThat's not what democracy is about. That is a movement toward oligarchy. And that is why we have got to overturn Citizens United and why I have run this campaign on the basis of saying we're going to make it on contributions averaging 27 bucks apiece, rather than being dependent on big money.\nBut this is the issue of American politics today. Do we have a government that represents all of us or just the 1 percent? And you're not going to have a government that represents all of us so long as you have candidates like Secretary Clinton being dependent on big-money interests.\nBASH: Senator, you just visited the Vatican, where you had a meeting with the pope. Vice President Joe Biden was asked about your trip.\nI want you to listen to what he said.\n[begin video clip]\nVICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN: I just think that Bernie making a trip is a good thing. But to suggest that the pope would -- embraces Bernie's policies, I don't think that's the case. I don't know. I doubt it.\n[end video clip]\nBASH: Senator, what's your response to that?\nSANDERS: Well, you know, I love Joe, and no one is suggesting that the pope is embracing my policies.\nWhat I will tell you is, I was very proud to have been invited by the Vatican to an important conference dealing with morality in economics. And, in my view, that is exactly the issue of the day. We have got to create an economics which is based on morality, dealing with the needs of working families and the elderly and the children and the sick and the poor, rather than an economy which is based on greed and the needs of Wall Street and big corporations.\nAnd the fact that I was invited there was very -- for me, a very moving experience. And that's the fight that we are going to continue to wage. We have levels of income and wealth inequality in this country. The rich are getting richer. Almost everybody else is getting poorer. We have got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. We need to create millions of decent-paying jobs.\nAnd I have been so impressed ever since Pope Francis came into power of his willingness to take on special interests, to talk about climate change, and the need to transform our energy system.\nSo, you know, I have probably been one of the members of Congress talking more often about the extraordinary role that Pope Francis is playing in raising issues that so rarely get discussed.\nBASH: Senator, let's return to what you were talking about before, money in politics.\nAt this week's debate in Brooklyn, I asked you to name one decision Hillary Clinton made as senator that shows she was influenced by the donations she got. You really didn't answer the question.\nSo, let's try it again. Can you point to a decision that Hillary Clinton made as senator that shows she favored banks because of the donations she received?\nSANDERS: Well, as a matter of fact, she voted for a bad bankruptcy legislation. But -- and whether that is a result of contributions from Wall Street or elsewhere, you know, no one can say that, Dana.\nBut what I would also repeat to you is, the most important issue is, what is your stand on Wall Street? And I think, to me, when you have it being very clear that Wall Street's greed and illegal behavior -- you know, Goldman Sachs just paid a $5 billion settlement with the government. When you have that kind of greed and illegal behavior, bringing our economy into the worst economic recession since the '30s, I think the immediate response must be to break up these large financial institutions.\nBASH: Now...\nSANDERS: That is my view. That is the view of a number of leading economists. That is not Hillary Clinton's position.\nBASH: Now, also at the debate, you were asked about Sandy Hook families who want to sue gun manufacturers. You said -- quote -- \"They have the right to sue.\"\nBut just last week, you told \"The Daily News\" the opposite. Listen.\n[begin audio clip]\nSANDERS: Do I think the -- the right...\nQUESTION: Yes.\nSANDERS: ... of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer. That's your question?\nQUESTION: Correct.\nSANDERS: No, I don't.\n[end audio clip]\nBASH: So, Senator, what changed?\nSANDERS: Well, what changed is, I think -- I think, if you go into that interview a little bit longer, you will see the nuance of that interview.\nOf course they have the right to sue. Anybody has the right to sue. And they just won an initial decision in their favor last week. But if you go into that discussion a little bit longer, do I end up believing that, if a gun store owner, a small gun store owner in rural Vermont or anyplace else, sells you a weapon legally, you come in with all the proper identification, you pass the instant background check, you legally purchase the gun, and you go out and you shoot somebody, that that small gun store owner should be held liable?\nNo, I don't. I really don't. But I have got to tell you also, on this issue of these assault weapons, let's be clear. Back in 1988, in Vermont, I likely lost an election because I alone stood up to the gun people and said, no, I don't think that assault weapons should be sold and distributed in America. That was my view then.\nThat's the type of weapon that caused that horrific tragedy in Sandy Hook. Those weapons should not be made available in the United States of America. So, in that sense, I agree with the Sandy Hook parents. But it's a question of how you go forward.\nBASH: Let's talk about something in the news that will be on your plate as a sitting U.S. senator. Saudi Arabia has told the Obama administration that it will sell off hundreds of billions of dollars of American assets if Congress allows the Saudi government to held -- to be held responsible in American courts for any role in the 9/11 attacks.\nHow do you intend to vote as a senator?\nSANDERS: Well, I need more information before I can give you a decision.\nBut, clearly, I have, as you have heard me say, a whole lot of concerns about the role that Saudi Arabia has been playing for many, many years, not just the individuals who came from Saudi Arabia who attacked us on 9/11, but their support for ISIS and other terrorist organizations. The Saudi family is a huge family, many hundreds, if not thousands of people in the ruling family worth many hundreds of billions of dollars.\nBASH: But if I may, Senator, in general, should Saudi Arabia be -- should it be possible to hold them liable in U.S. courts?\nSANDERS: Well, you're going to hear -- you're asking me to give you a decision about a situation and a piece of legislation that I am not familiar with at this point.\nAnd I have got to have more information on that. So, you have got to get some information before you can render, I think, a sensible decision. But I do have a lot of concerns about the role, in general, that Saudi Arabia has played and the royal family has played in supporting Wahhabism, which is the extreme right-wing Islamic movement, which is part of what ISIS and al Qaeda are about.\nBASH: And, finally, Senator, on Friday, you released last year's tax returns. Secretary Clinton has posted her tax returns from the past eight years. So, will you do the same?\nSANDERS: We will post more of them. Yes, we will.\nI mean, I don't have -- to be honest with you, our tax returns showed us that we made more money -- we made less money in a given year than Secretary Clinton made in one speech. We don't have a bunch of -- Jane and I don't have a bunch of accountants working for us. We will get it out.\nI think we have all that information, and we will get them out as soon as we can, which...\nBASH: By when, sir?\nSANDERS: ... which will be very soon. We got out one. We will get out more.\nBASH: Like this week?\nSANDERS: Probably.\nBASH: OK.\nSenator, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117076", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:55 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I apologize for the late start today. (Laughter.) Almost. I do not have anything at the top, Kevin, so we can go straight to your questions.\nQ: Okay, Josh. So I was wondering if the White House had any feedback on how it felt about how it went this morning in the landmark immigration case. Chief Justice Roberts asked questions suggesting he could side with the administration if there were some small changes in the proposed programs; others were more pointed about whether the President had usurped Congress's authority.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I think -- and those of you who covered the two Supreme Court cases to consider the constitutionality of the President's health care reform law will remember how unwise it is to try to draw conclusions about the likely decision of the Supreme Court based solely on the questioning of the justices. In fact, I remember that there were a number of legal pundits that emerged with some egg on their face after offering up some rather dire predictions about the administration's argument after watching the questioning, only to see a favorable ruling in the end.\nSo at this point, I'm going to withhold any prognostications on the part of the administration and just reiterate our continued confidence in the power of the legal argument that the Solicitor General presented to the Court today.\nQ: Can you speak as to why the President signed off on the U.S. deploying 200 additional troops to Iraq, and to sending Apache helicopters for the first time into the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq? Is this a short-term increase? Did the Pentagon indicate that was the right number?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that Secretary Carter is traveling in the region today; he was in Iraq today meeting with Iraqi officials to discuss these enhancements to our counter-ISIL campaign. All of the work that takes place in Iraq by the United States military is closely coordinated with the Iraqi government and Iraqi forces.\nObviously, Iraq is a sovereign nation, and making decisions like retaking Mosul from ISIL will be decisions that are made by the Iraqi government. What the United States has sought to do at every turn is to support our partners in Iraq as they implement a political strategy to unite the country, but also as they carry out a military strategy to drive ISIL out of those areas of Iraq where they have encroached.\nThe President's instructions to his national security team have consistently been to look for opportunities to reinforce those elements of our campaign that are showing some progress. And the announcements that Secretary Carter made earlier today are consistent with that instruction from the President, and these enhancements are consistent with recommendations that the President received from his military advisors.\nTim.\nQ: Could you confirm whether the First Lady and the girls are going to be going on any part of the President's trip?\nMR. EARNEST: Tim, as you may have seen, the First Lady will join the President for part of his trip in the UK. But for more details on the travel of the First Family, I'd refer you to the First Lady's Office.\nQ: And the oil producer talks in Doha fell apart last night. Is there any concern -- is the administration concerned that Saudi Arabia could embark on another effort to gain market share and the oil price would go down and that that would hurt U.S. producers?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, at this point, obviously the United States and our economists pay close attention to fluctuations in the global oil market, and we're obviously aware of the kinds of political efforts that are underway -- or some of the political efforts by oil producers to coordinate their activities to maximize the economic standing of their individual countries.\nWe're aware of all of that going on. And we're certainly conscious of the fact that it has an impact on the U.S. economy. But at least from here, I wouldn't comment on any decisions made by any individual countries with regard to their oil production activities. I can just tell you that the administration has been very focused on energy security here in the United States. That is part of the strategy that has led us to a situation where the United States is producing significant quantities of both oil and natural gas here domestically in a way that does bring some important stability to our broader economy.\nBut we've also been focused on a strategy that includes increases in energy efficiency. We certainly have seen important increases in energy efficiency when it comes to cars and trucks that are on the road here in the United States. But we've also been focused on looking for other ways to generate energy, renewable energy like wind and solar.\nSo those kinds of investments have paid off in a way that's been good for the U.S. economy both in the short run, and stands to only expand its potential economic benefit in the decades ahead.\nQ: But the last time the Saudis embarked on this and just started opening a tap a couple years ago, it sent the price down, and the U.S. is now producing only at 2009 levels. Are you concerned that this could hurt U.S. jobs?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, again, I don't think I would comment on any individual decisions or even potential decisions to be made by other countries. I'll just note that this is a welcome respite from the first six or seven years when I sat behind this podium and had to answer questions from your colleagues or other news organizations that asked whether or not the United States was concerned about the impact that high oil prices would have on the U.S. economy. So I wouldn't speculate either about what impact low oil prices would have on the U.S. economy, but the tenor of this conversation certainly seems preferable to the tenor of those conversations in earlier years.\nQ: Just one on the bridge that Russia is building to Crimea. There's some support on both sides. Even in Crimea, there's some at this point hoping that the isolation will be less if the bridge is built. But there's a lot of money -- $3.2 billion. Is this money that President Putin could be spending better elsewhere?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have a lot of information about their development plans, and obviously I wouldn't second-guess any independent decisions that the Russian government is going to make as it relates to infrastructure. I can tell you that the President continues to make a forceful case to President Putin that he should abide by the commitments that he made in the context of the Minsk talks. And I can tell you that President Obama had a conversation with President Putin today on this exact issue. The two leaders spoke this morning, and we'll have a more robust readout of their call later today.\nBut the United States continues to believe, and President Obama continues to make a forceful case that Russia needs to abide by their commitments. And by doing so, they can begin to relieve some of the isolation that they have sustained as a result of interfering in the sovereign activities of their neighbors in Ukraine.\nQ: You say the phone call was mostly on Crimea, or --\nMR. EARNEST: The telephone conversation did spend a lot of time focused on the situation in Ukraine. There also was a rather intense discussion, as you'd expect, around the situation in Syria. But like I said, we'll have more details on the phone conversation later today.\nMark.\nQ: Can you say if President Obama raised the issue of the buzzing of the U.S. warship in the Baltic earlier last week?\nMR. EARNEST: I asked this specific question and that did not come up in the call between the two Presidents. As I mentioned yesterday, those kinds of activities are destabilizing, a source of some concern, but they're not particularly unusual. And there is an already well-established channel for expressing our concerns about those kinds of incidents from the U.S. military attachй in Moscow to his Russian military counterpart. Those concerns were raised at that level and were not escalated beyond that.\nQ: There was another incident over the weekend where a Russian aircraft intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane. Has a complaint been lodged by usual channels on that incident?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, I think this is a good illustration of just how these kinds of incidents, while provocative and concerning, are not particularly unusual. And I do not know at this point whether or not specific concerns have been raised about the incident that you just referenced. But it is a good illustration that these kinds of actions are not particularly unusual.\nQ: Secretary Kerry said last week in an interview that the United States would be within its justification to have fired on those two aircraft that repeatedly buzzed the warship in the Baltic. Did you see those remarks, and did he represent the White House view?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't see those remarks. I think the point that Secretary Kerry was making is that those kinds of actions are provocative. And it's certainly why we encourage the Russians to not engage in those kinds of activities. Abiding by generally accepted international norms, particularly when operating in either international waters or in international airspace, is important. But again, since we have ample opportunities to express our concerns about these kinds of provocative actions to the Russians, it did not necessitate a presidential-level conversation.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to go back to a couple things you just said. This phone conversation with President Obama and Putin, how intense was the conversation? You said it was an intense conversation. And what components were the intense pieces?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know that I'm going to get into that much detail. I don't think I used the word \"tense.\"\nQ: You said \"intense.\"\nMR. EARNEST: Intense.\nQ: So I'm using a piece of \"intense.\" (Laughter.) How tense --\nMR. EARNEST: I think that distorts the meaning of what I'm trying to convey.\nQ: -- not distort. Tell me, how intense was it?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm telling you is that there are important issues for the two leaders to discuss, and they had an opportunity to discuss them at some length this morning. And obviously when we're talking about the situation in Syria, it's rather serious, and there continues to be concern about all of the parties living up to the commitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities.\nAnd obviously we have for years now encouraged President Putin and the Russian government to use the influence that they have with the Assad regime to compel them to act constructively. And more recently that means to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities, and that abiding by that arrangement around the cessation of hostilities is going to be critical to our ability to move forward on the diplomatic track and bring about the kind of political transition that's long overdue inside of Syria.\nAnd President Putin has publicly expressed his view that this kind of political transition is critical to both Russian and U.S. interests in that country and in the broader region. And this is an opportunity where our interests overlap, and it's an opportunity for the President to once again make the case to President Putin that he should use his influence with the Assad regime to live up to the commitments that they've made in the context of the cessation of hostilities.\nUnfortunately, we've seen that the cessation of hostilities continues to be fragile and increasingly threatened due to continued violations by the regime. And this was the subject of what I think you could accurately describe as an intense conversation.\nQ: Was there more consternation that resulted from this meeting, from this phone conversation between the two? Were they at an impasse with the intense conversation?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I wouldn't describe it as an impasse. It's not uncommon for them to have these kinds of conversations. And this is an opportunity for them to consult on these important matters once again.\nQ: And lastly, going back to the Merrick nomination, it's been said now from some members on Capitol Hill that the President did reach out to some members of the Congressional Black Caucus as they were still angry about the fact that -- upset about the fact that a black person or a black female was not nominated. And I know a couple of people, to include Congressman James Clyburn, the President actually reached out to and talked to. Could you talk to us about some of those calls that the President made and the talks that he had with members of the CBC?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any conversations like that that have occurred recently. The President did address this at some length when he traveled to the University of Chicago a week and a half ago. The President talked about his unparalleled record of appointing people to the federal bench to ensure that that institution reflects the diversity of the country. And we've been through the statistics before about what the President's record looks like. The President has appointed 117 minority judges. That's more than any President in history. Nine African American circuit court judges, which is as many as any other President in history. Twenty-six African American female judges. Thirty-seven Hispanic judges. Twenty judges from the APIA community. All of those are totals that exceed any other President in American history.\nIn this case, the President made a decision that is consistent with the way that he made this decision in the past, which is, when the President appointed Justice Sotomayor, the first Hispanic to the Supreme Court, he picked the best person for the job. He picked someone of unquestioned integrity, somebody with unquestioned legal credentials, and somebody with a commitment to interpreting the law and not advancing a political agenda. He used the same criteria to choose Elena Kagan and nominate her to the Supreme Court. And he used that same criteria to choose Merrick Garland.\nSo that's why we're going to continue to urge the Senate to fulfill their constitutional duty. Obviously, Republicans in the Senate described Chief Judge Garland as a consensus nominee, and we believe that he should be treated accordingly.\nQ: And last question. You said from that podium that this administration listened to their constituency when it came to the potential nominee. And we had black leaders who submitted the request for an African American or black person or a black woman. Now, Lani Guinier -- I talked to her last week -- she was of a mind that if you had picked an African American woman, she would have a tough year, just like she did in 1993. When you laid out all the requests and looked at the landscape, was that part of the equation -- that if you did nominate an African American woman, you might have gotten the same thing that you were seeing when Clinton nominated Lani Guinier in 1993?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think there was any previous presidential appointment that came to mind. I think in this case, the President was focused on fulfilling his constitutional responsibility. And the President was convinced that the American people would be best served by the President choosing the very best person for the job, and that's exactly what he's done. The President chose somebody, in the form of Chief Judge Garland, who is the chief judge on the second highest court in the land. Chief Judge Garland has more experience on the federal bench than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history.\nThat's why we've seen Republicans describe him in the past as being a consensus nominee. And just in the last week, we heard Republican Senator Rob Portman, from Ohio, describe Chief Judge Garland as \"an impressive guy.\" You heard Republican Senator Pay Toomey, from Pennsylvania, describe Chief Judge Garland as very, very smart and very knowledgeable. Last week, Senator Flake described Chief Judge Garland as \"obviously a man of accomplishment and keen intellect.\" So many Republicans have reached the same kind of conclusion that President Obama has about the ability of Chief Judge Garland to serve on the Supreme Court with honor and distinction in a lifetime appointment.\nAnd that's the assessment that people make when they set aside politics. It's only when politics intrude that Republicans step forward and say that they're not going to consider anybody that's been appointed by President Obama. They're not doing that because they're concerned with who President Obama appointed. They're doing that because they are in a different political party than President Barack Obama. That intrusion of partisan politics into the Supreme Court process is not good for our country. It's inconsistent with most Americans' understanding of the Constitution. It's also inconsistent with most Americans' understanding of what the Senate's job is.\nAnd that's why I think you have seen some traction around this argument that Republicans are not doing their job. They have failed. They have dropped the ball when it comes to fulfilling their responsibility to consider the appointment that the President has thoughtfully put forward.\nI guess one thing that I can tell you is that there are some meetings that Chief Judge Garland will participate in this week. He will do meetings with five different senators over the course of this week. On Tuesday, he'll meet with Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. On Wednesday, Chief Judge Garland will meet with Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Nelson -- those will be separate meetings. And then on Thursday, Chief Judge Garland -- although it would be interesting if they did it together, I guess. But they will be separate. And then on Thursday, Chief Judge Garland will meet with Senator Menendez and Senator Kaine.\nSo at the end of this week, Chief Judge Garland will have met with, I believe that will bring the total to 40 United States senators, including 10 Republican United States senators. So he continues to fulfill his responsibility to engage with members of Congress. These kinds of private meetings have long been a precursor to a more public hearing -- or a public hearing. And this is the case that we're going to continue to make, that when you hear Republicans say that they don't want a hearing, frankly it's because they're concerned that Chief Judge Garland is going to do well in a hearing and they don't want the American people to be left with the impression that this individual deserves a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court because it's then going to make it harder -- even harder than it already is -- for them to block his nomination.\nSo we're going to continue to make the case that Republicans in the Senate should do their job, and hopefully they will.\nMary.\nQ: Back on the 28 pages of the 9/11 report. You said last week that you'd check to see if the President had actually read those pages. I'm just wondering if you've had a chance to get that answer, if he does support declassifying those pages.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not he's read the 28 pages. Obviously there is a process that's underway at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to consider those 28 pages and determine how much, if any, of those documents can be declassified and released. There's a well-established process for this, and I'd refer you to Director Clapper's office for an update on where that process stands and how soon a decision about a potential release could be made.\nQ: What's your response to 9/11 families who feel that, by opposing the Schumer-Cornyn legislation that the administration is siding with Saudi Arabia instead of with the victims?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, our concerns about this law are not related to its impact on our relationship with one particular country. In fact, our concern is about an important principle of international law. The whole notion of sovereign immunity is at stake and it is one that has more significant consequences for the United States than any other country.\nThe concern that we have is simply this: It could put the United States and our taxpayers and our servicemembers and our diplomats at significant risk if countries were -- other countries were to adopt a similar law. Let me give you one example. Obviously, the United States is involved in a wide variety of humanitarian relief efforts in countries around the world at any given time. If somebody decided that they wanted to -- that they were unhappy with the way that those humanitarian relief efforts were being carried out, you can imagine someone in some faraway country would file a lawsuit against the United States for our humanitarian relief efforts.\nThis, again, could potentially put the United States and our taxpayers at risk. It could also put individual U.S. servicemembers who are often involved in those humanitarian efforts at risk as well. That's why this principle of sovereign immunity is critically important. It allows countries to resolve their differences through diplomacy and not through the courts in one country or the other.\nWe continue to believe that the concerns that we have with Saudi Arabia can be addressed through diplomacy. Of course, they're an important counterterrorism partner to the United States. There are a variety of areas where we work closely together -- everything from trying to resolve the situation in Syria to degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL, to fighting al-Qaeda in Yemen, or to counter Iran's malign activities in the region. Those are all areas where the United States and Saudi Arabia work effectively together in a way that advances our shared interests. But we surely do not agree on everything. But our differences are differences that can be resolved through diplomacy and don't have to be resolved in a way that opens up the United States to significant potential vulnerability in a whole host of countries around the world.\nQ: And do you expect that this issue, both the legislation and the 28 pages, will be brought up later this week when the President meets with the King?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know at this point. I don't know that they will necessarily be on the President's agenda. Obviously, there are a lot of important things for us to discuss. I outlined a few of them, particularly as it relates to Iran and ISIL and even the situation in Yemen.\nThe President convened Saudi Arabia and the other GCC countries at Camp David last May, and at that summit, the President was focused on helping the GCC countries improve their coordination and cooperation so that they can work more effectively together in cooperation to advance their security interests. And the United States can certainly play a helpful role in facilitating that cooperation, both using our expertise, but in some cases, offering our technology and equipment.\nSo we obviously have a long agenda when we get there. But, look, if this issue were to come up, obviously I think the situation that I have described in terms of the potential consequences of rolling back this core principle of international law is how the President would explain our position to his counterpart.\nQ: And one question on Zika. If Congress does not go ahead and approve the $1.9 billion in funding that you're asking for, what's plan B, or what comes next? Dr. Fauci, over the weekend, said you would have to pull from other areas to continue for that vaccine development that's underway. Have you started the process to identify what other areas you could draw funding from?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think you'd have to talk to both Dr. Frieden at CDC and Dr. Fauci at NIH for a detailed answer to that question. I can tell you that what both of them have done as a matter of just being responsible public health professionals is they've been forced to prioritize. And that has meant pulling resources away from some core priorities to focus on this emerging threat.\nThat's a significant problem, particularly when you consider that there's no good reason that Congress hasn't acted. This is not right now an urgent situation. For the last two months, it's been a situation that's called for congressional action. That's why we put forward a detailed proposal for members of Congress to act on. Instead, Republicans in Congress have done little to nothing to address this issue for the last two months. And the opportunity to get ahead of this potentially serious situation is washing away. And that's a significant problem.\nSo we've already seen our public health experts do the responsible thing and begin to focus on what resources can be used to address the threat from Zika, but they are insufficient. And we need Congress to fulfill its responsibility to put the public health and well-being of the American people first, and to act on the Zika funding request that we put forward now nearly two months ago.\nSuzanne.\nQ: I want to go back to Saudi Arabia. Would the President veto legislation allowing relatives of the victims of 9/11 who would sue the Saudi government or other foreign entities who were shown to be directly involved in the 9/11 attacks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Suzanne, given the long list of concerns that I've expressed about rolling back this core principle of international law, it's difficult to imagine a scenario in which the President would sign the bill as it's currently drafted.\nObviously, the President has devoted significant time in office to fighting for the 9/11 families, and fighting for those who risked their lives to rescue and rebuild after 9/11, particularly at Ground Zero. So the priority that the President places on these issues is well-documented, and what the President believes is that the most effective way for us to advance our interests, particularly as it relates to countering violent extremism and countering terrorist organizations around the world, is for us to use our American military where necessary to protect the American people, but to try to work cooperatively with other countries around the world to advance our shared interests.\nAnd since 9/11, we have seen a genuine focus on the part of the Saudis to countering those who seek to profligate extremist ideology. We recognize, and the Saudis now recognize, just how dangerous that is. And the United States and Saudi Arabia now work together to counter those who seek to advance these ideologies. And we do that in a way that demonstrates the ability of our two nations to cooperate, particularly on issues that are important to the national security of the citizens in both our countries.\nQ: The Saudis have threatened to sell billions of U.S. assets if the legislation passes. Is the President going to address that?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I don't know that this issue is going to come up in their meetings, in part because I'm confident that the Saudis recognize, just as much as we do, our shared interest in preserving the stability of the global financial system.\nQ: But the administration -- I mean, what is the response to that threat?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I feel confident in telling you that the Saudis recognize the shared interest that the United States and Saudi Arabia have in protecting the stability of the international financial system.\nQ: Is the administration dismissing the threat?\nMR. EARNEST: I think I've been pretty clear in answering your question.\nQ: On another topic -- the bus explosion in Jerusalem, there's been conflicting reports in terms of an explosion regarding a terrorist threat or if it was something mechanical. Do you have anything?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any firsthand information about this. Obviously we're aware of those reports, and law enforcement officials in Israel are taking a close look at this, as they should. And I'm confident that they'll take a close look at this and that U.S. officials will stay in touch with them on this matter.\nQ: And back to immigration. At the Supreme Court today, outside, there were many undocumented immigrants who really wanted to know from the administration what they should do. If the Supreme Court comes back and supports the administration's deferred action programs, knowing that this is something that could be changed or reversed under a Republican administration, whether or not that they should, in fact, come out of the shadows with just months away from potentially facing that kind of risk. Is there advice or guidance that the administration is giving to those people?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point we're going to wait and see what the Supreme Court decides. That's what our process -- that's what our legal process dictates. And obviously the U.S. government and the Obama administration has been deeply engaged in that process, and we have made strong arguments before the courts about the wisdom of this approach. We've also made strong arguments about how the approach that President Obama has pursued to use this executive authority to bring greater accountability to our immigration system is consistent with the way that President Reagan and President George H.W. Bush used their executive authority. Both of those Presidents used their executive authority to offer relief to undocumented immigrants, and offered them the opportunity to get a job in the United States. And that was relief that was granted to about 40 percent of the undocumented population in the United States at the time.\nPresident Obama has used the same authority to do exactly the same kind of thing. That's why we continue to be confident in the persuasiveness of the arguments that we have made before the courts. But at this point, it's unclear exactly what impact this will have on the policy process and in our ability to implement this policy decision that the President and his team have made here. So once we have greater clarity from the Supreme Court, we'll be able to offer clearer guidance to those who are eager to get that relief.\nChip.\nQ: Josh, you said to ask Director Clapper about the 28 pages, but isn't this a decision that is of such magnitude that it would be decided by the President, himself, eventually?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, this is something that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is handling consistent with the well-established process for declassifying sensitive national security material.\nQ: But won't the President make the decision himself eventually?\nMR. EARNEST: Not necessarily. This is something that our intelligence community does routinely. And at this point, I would --\nQ: There's nothing routine about this. I mean, this is a major document. This isn't just another classified document that they have to decide whether to declassify or not.\nMR. EARNEST: No, I would acknowledge that there is something -- that this is --\nQ: Unique --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's significant because it relates to obviously the biggest terrorist attack that's been carried out on American soil. So it's obviously something that the intelligence community takes quite seriously, but they take all these matters quite seriously. And there's a well-established --\nQ: Are you going to say the President, himself, may not make this decision?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm saying is that there is a well-established process that the intelligence community has for considering these kinds of questions. And right now that is the process that we're in the middle of.\nQ: And on the Supreme Court -- do you think -- or does the President think -- and maybe you've addressed this before; I'm not here all the time now -- but does the President think that decisions of this level of importance should be postponed until there are nine members on the Supreme Court?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President believes that it's the Supreme Court's responsibility to determine how this should be best handled. Obviously it was President Reagan who was pretty outspoken in making the case that these kinds of cases should be handled with the full complement of justices. I'm just looking for the --\nQ: Does President Obama agree with President Reagan on that?\nMR. EARNEST: He most assuredly does. And look, for every day that goes by that the Supreme Court does not have the full complement of justices, the American people are not best served by their legal system. And that is the argument that President Reagan made in urging the United States Senate to act on his nominee to the Supreme Court. That was action that he was urging them to take in his final year in office. It was an election year. It was President Reagan's final year in office.\nThat's exactly the situation that we have now. When President Reagan was in office and he made that case, Democrats has the majority in the Senate, and they went along with it. They recognized that they had a constitutional duty to confirm Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court, and that's what they did. We're simply asking Republicans to do exactly the same thing.\nQ: Has the President been briefed by Don Verrilli on the Supreme Court case today? Do you know?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that the President -- he has not been briefed by the Solicitor General, at least not today. But I would anticipate that the President will get briefed by his staff about how the arguments went before the Supreme Court before the end of the day today.\nQ: And do you know if the President has voiced -- or if anybody has voiced any opinion on the issue of standing, and if that would be a good way to resolve this case for now, since there are only eight justices on the Court?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't listen to the whole argument today, so I don't know how this issue came up in the argument today.\nQ: It looks like Kennedy is a little iffy on it.\nMR. EARNEST: It's hard to tell just based solely on the questioning. There are a lot of assumptions made about the views of the justices, of the Affordable Care Act, based solely on how they questioned the Solicitor General at the time. That proved to be a rather unreliable measure of the -- or unreliable predictor of the eventual outcome.\nQ: But if they were to throw it out on standing, that would be a major victory for the administration, would it not?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm no attorney, but my understanding is, based on the public reporting on this, that, yes, if this is an argument that is thrown out on standing, then it would allow the administration to move forward with implementing this executive action. And we would obviously welcome the ability to do that.\nMark.\nQ: On Iraq and the deployments there -- 200 additional soldiers doesn't seem like a huge amount in the grand scheme of things, but now the number is back over -- the authorized level is back over 4,000.\nMR. EARNEST: That's right.\nQ: And plus, some of these special operators are going to be going to the battalion level, which Secretary Carter acknowledged puts them closer to actual combat. Isn't this a classic case of mission-creep?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, this is a classic case of the President asking his team to develop ways to intensify those elements of our strategy that have shown some progress. And we know that Iraqi forces fighting ISIL on the ground, in Iraq, have benefitted tremendously from the advice and assistance that they have received from U.S. servicemembers that have accompanied them. And what we have sought to do is to develop a strategy that would allow us to offer more advice and to offer greater assistance. That does not, however, put American servicemembers automatically on the front lines.\nI'm not seeking to downplay the significant risk that our servicemembers are taking in Iraq. We've already seen a couple of U.S. servicemembers killed in Iraq. What they're doing is quite dangerous. That certainly applies to the fighter pilots that have been flying missions over Iraq and in Syria for well over a year now. These are men and women in our military who are putting themselves in harm's way for our national security. We owe them a debt of gratitude. But that is different than the kind of ground combat mission that more than 100,000 U.S. servicemembers had when President Bush sent them into Iraq. The mission that they have now is quite different.\nQ: But even if it isn't 100,000 men, doesn't it further Americanize a fight that the President himself has said most effectively is fought by local forces on the ground?\nMR. EARNEST: That is exactly right. This has to be a fight that is led by local forces. And the decisions that were announced today were announced after Secretary Carter had an opportunity to consult with Iraqi government officials, because Iraqi government officials are going to continue to call the shots here. And they obviously benefit tremendously from the support that they have received from the United States and our coalition partners. That support comes in a variety of forms. And what was announced today were ideas for intensifying that support in a rather tangible way. But it does not change the basic elements of the strategy, which is that this has to be a fight that is led by local forces with the support and assistance of the United States and our coalition partners. And that's exactly what we've done thus far, and that hasn't changed based on the enhancements that were announced today.\nAngela.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you bring me up to speed on the state of play on breaking the logjam on Eric Fanning's nomination to be Army Secretary? As I'm sure you know, Senator Roberts has a hold on that nomination, looking for a promise that the administration pledges to not send any Guantanamo Bay detainees to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a significant -- I don't have a procedural update to offer from here. Obviously, there is no questioning Mr. Fanning's commitment to serving this country. He is someone of unquestioned integrity and expertise when it comes to the critical functions of the United States Army. And he is a nominee who deserves bipartisan confirmation by the United States Senate, and he's been held up for too long. And it's unfortunate that his nomination and his career in service to this country has been ensnared in political arguments made by one particular senator.\nQ: Does the administration plan to offer a promise, a pledge to Senator Roberts on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think we've been quite clear about our commitment to closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and seeking the cooperation with the United States Senate -- even if they're unwilling to help in that effort, the least they can do is remove the unwarranted obstructions that they have erected that have prevented the closing of the prison.\nIt is hard to imagine that Senator Roberts takes this particularly seriously. You may recall the last time that anybody has talked about Senator Roberts was when he filmed a video of himself crumbling up the President's plan to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay and throwing it in a wastebasket. So maybe he relishes the opportunity to be before the camera, but it's not apparent that he takes this critically important national security issue all that seriously.\nQ: One follow-up also on the call with Putin. Was that call initiated by the U.S. or by Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know who initiated the phone call today.\nQ: Do you know the length of time that call lasted?\nMR. EARNEST: No, but we'll look into it for you. I don't have all the details.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you be more specific about the White House position on Saudi threats to sell off U.S. assets if the 9/11 bill passes? You say you don't think Saudi Arabia will follow through with this threat, or that the President will veto this bill so we wouldn't actually see this come to a head. Is the White House concerned about it? How do we interpret your answer earlier?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, I tried to be as clear as I could be. I outlined the significant concerns that the United States has and the administration has with the idea of rolling back this key principle of international law. This question of sovereign immunity is something that protects the ability of the United States to work closely with countries all around the world. And walking back that principle would put the United States, our taxpayers and our servicemembers and diplomats at risk. And putting them into legal jeopardy is not a good idea and something that the President strongly opposes. And that's why he wouldn't sign legislation that would do that.\nAs it relates to this discussion about the selling of U.S. treasuries, obviously a country with a modern and large economy like Saudi Arabia would not benefit from a destabilized global financial market. And neither would the United States.\nQ: Would this also impact -- would such action have a significant impact on the U.S. economy? Is that something the White House is worried about?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm pointing out is that the Saudi government recognizes that both our countries and our economies benefit from the smooth functioning of the global financial system and it's not in their interest to destabilize it.\nQ: Can I follow up?\nMR. EARNEST: Go ahead, Connie.\nQ: What's the status of the memorandum of understanding? And does the President have any plan to go to Israel or --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update for you on those discussions. I can certainly check with my National Security Council colleagues to see if they can provide you with an update. At this point, I don't have any new international travel to announce, but if the President decides to go to Israel I'm sure all of you will have the opportunity to travel with him.\nQ: How is he getting along with Netanyahu?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I mentioned I guess a number of times over the years, the best way to evaluate the relationship between our two countries is not based on the pleasantries that are exchanged in private discussions, but rather on the commitment of the leaders of two countries to, working together and cooperating, to advance the interests of their respective countries. And obviously, President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu have been able to work effectively to demonstrate the U.S. rock-solid commitment to Israel's national security. In fact, it was Prime Minister Netanyahu, himself, who indicated that the security cooperation between Israel and the United States under President Obama's leadership was unprecedented. And that's an ongoing commitment that President Obama has made throughout his seven years in office.\nRich.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. To return to the Saudi-9/11 issue, in a conversation today that David Axelrod and Ben Rhodes had on CNN, Ben Rhodes said that there were people in the government doing their thing -- Saudi government -- where there was insufficient attention to where all this money was going over many years from the government apparatus. If that is the case, shouldn't then there be some holding of responsibility by someone in the Saudi government? And doesn't that underscore those who support this bill and their argument?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Rich, let me start out by saying that Mr. Rhodes is currently the Deputy National Security Advisor, but earlier in his career he worked closely with Lee Hamilton, former Congressman from Indiana, who was the author of the report. And Ben had worked closely with Congressman Hamilton to write that report, so he's got his own detailed knowledge of this particular situation.\nObviously, that report concluded that they were not able to find any evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or that senior Saudi government officials were knowingly supportive of the 9/11 plotters. That's something that's included in the report. That's a report that's been declassified and made available to the public --\nQ: But it doesn't mention those beneath that, and that's what he's talking about here.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I didn't look at the whole conversation, but I think what he's referring to is something that is included in the 9/11 Commission Report.\nMore generally, I just want to go back to the fact that our concerns with the way the law is currently written stems from our view that protecting sovereign immunity is more important for the United States than it is for any other country. And walking back from the core international legal principle could have a significant and negative impact on our ability to do business around the world. Even worse, it could put U.S. servicemembers and diplomats into legal jeopardy in other countries' courts.\nAnd that's not going to advance our interests. That's not going to make us safer. It would only make it harder for us to effectively engage and coordinate and cooperate with countries around the world, including Saudi Arabia, who has been helpful in our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, to go after al Qaida elements in Yemen, and to counter Iran's malign activities throughout the Middle East.\nSo this particular principle that we're discussing is not just about our relationship with one country, it's about the United States' relationship and our ability to work with countries all around the world.\nQ: So ruling out the court system as a venue, what recourse do the 9/11 families have if there's an acknowledgement that there perhaps are some within a foreign government who may be responsible?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Rich, what I can tell you is that the administration has worked aggressively to support the 9/11 families seeking compensation, and we have worked hard to support, and offered our full-throated support, to the rescue workers who risked their lives to rescue innocent Americans and to rebuild at Ground Zero. That's the President's record when it comes to 9/11 and in supporting those who lost loved ones on 9/11.\nThe legacy of that event is that President Obama has also sought to make protecting the American people his number-one priority. And he's worked with our allies and partners around the globe to counter terrorism, to advance our national security, and to advance our interests. And the truth is, countries like Saudi Arabia -=- a country like Saudi Arabia is a good example. We certainly do not agree with everything that Saudi Arabia does, and there are numerous differences between our two countries. But the fact remains that the United States and Saudi Arabia are able to coordinate effectively to counter terrorism, to combat extremists, to degrade and destroy ISIL, and to advance the security interests of both of our countries.\nThat's why this kind of cooperation is critically important. It's why the President hosted Saudi Arabia and the other GCC countries at Camp David last spring. And it's why he's traveling to Saudi Arabia this week to meet with the leaders of GCC countries to talk about deepening our cooperation and ensuring that as they work together to provide for their own security that the United States can continue to facilitate improved cooperation among them.\nQ: Has the President conducted any personal outreach on this bill? Congressional outreach?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any presidential-level conversations about this particular piece of legislation.\nQ: And just one more question on the $750 billion. Is it safe to say that you would -- given what you've said on this briefing, that given the concerns that the Saudis might have, what it would do to the world economy and their own economy if they were to unload $750 billion of U.S. assets, that it's essentially a bluff?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm just -- the principle that I've repeatedly stated I'll state one more time, which is the United States certainly believes that Saudi Arabia understands our shared interest in protecting the stability and security of the international financial system. Saudi Arabia is a large economy and they would not benefit from roiling global financial markets.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. A budget question. Last Friday, you indicated that the Overseas Contingency Fund shouldn't be used as sort of a slush fund. But Republicans are looking for more defense spending. You're looking, and Democrats are looking for Zika funding, for water funding, those type of things. Is there a deal to be had to increase spending as long as it's both defense and nondefense?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Cheryl, when it comes to protecting the basic public health and well-being of the American people, that shouldn't be the subject of wheeling and dealing. It should be the subject of members of the United States Congress, particularly Republicans, setting aside politics and doing their job. And in this case, the administration, after consulting with our foremost scientists and public health experts, put together a funding proposal and sent it to Congress two months ago.\nCongress has not acted on that funding proposal, and instead, our public health professionals have been forced to pull money from other critical functions in order to try to begin the work of preparing for the Zika virus, when the truth is that if Congress had acted as the way you would expect them to, that money would have already been provided and our public health professionals would be farther along in their work to protect the country from the Zika virus, and our state and local partners around the country who will be at the front lines of this would be better prepared to, for example, eradicate mosquito populations, or to target mosquito populations to prevent an outbreak.\nWe also would see enhanced lab capacity so that people who are seeking to get a Zika test would be able to get the test in the first place, but would also be able to get a prompt response from the lab after they had undergone the test. Neither of those is true right now.\nSo there is more that we need Congress to do, and there's no reason it should be subject to a negotiation. This is part of the basic responsibility of the United States Congress, which is to take responsible steps, separate from politics, to protect the public health and well-being of the American people. That's what they should do.\nFred.\nQ: There was release out today that the FBI, the Association of National Police Chiefs and other law enforcement groups are supporting the Burr-Feinstein legislation on encryption. And that's something that it's reported that the White House is very undecided about it at least. Is there any rethinking on that as to whether the President would sign it if it does come to his desk?\nMR. EARNEST: Fred, I have to admit, when you started that question I thought you were going to talk about the extensive law enforcement support for the President's executive actions on immigration. A similar group of law enforcement officials have come out and expressed their strong support for the President's immigration executive action. And despite what the Attorney General of Texas might tell you, the fact is the top law enforcement officials in the state of Texas actually think that what the President wants to do when it comes to our immigration system would actually make communities in Texas safer. But that's just one example, and that's one tangent that's on my mind based on the way that you asked your question.\nBut, yes, as it relates to encryption, I'm not aware that we've taken a specific position on the legislation that you referred to. Obviously administration officials have been in touch with members who Congress who are interested in this issue. There is expertise that law enforcement and technological experts in the U.S. government can offer as this kind of policy is being carefully considered. The administration has engaged in those conversations in good faith.\nWhat I continue to harbor is deep skepticism that Congress will succeed in writing and passing legislation that would effectively address this complicated policy issue. In some ways, the context of your question is relevant because, when it comes to something like Zika, that should probably be among the easiest things that Congress should have to do to make a decision about making sure that our public health professionals have the money that they need to protect the American people from a virus. That's a pretty straightforward thing.\nWhen it comes to encryption, that's much more complicated. We're talking about a technology that's rapidly changing and questions about deeply held principles related to both national security and privacy. I just happen to be personally skeptical that Congress would succeed in getting something useful done on that when even the simple things, like protecting the American people from Zika, Congress seems unable to do.\nQ: So your skepticism is not to the substance of the Burr-Feinstein bill, but it's whether Congress could actually get this done?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think a congressional process that yield a piece of legislation that is both effective in addressing the problem and capable of passing both Republican-led bodies in Congress -- yes, I'm quite skeptical that that will happen.\nQ: And I have a question on -- last week, the House Freedom Caucus called again for impeachment of the IRS Commissioner. The House Oversight Committee had initially put this idea forward. First, is there a White House response to that? And secondly, does the President have full confidence in the IRS Commissioner?\nMR. EARNEST: Of course, he does. It is ridiculous for Republicans in Congress, who seek to gut funding for the IRS -- in some cases, they actually call for the outright abolition of the agency -- to be a fair arbiter of the effectiveness of the IRS Commissioner. The fact is, Mr. Koskinen has an extraordinarily difficult job, and it's made only more difficult because Republicans seek to try to cut the funding of his agency. He is somebody who undertakes that work with a lot of professionalism and seriousness of purpose, and he deserves our gratitude for his good work.\nDave.\nQ: Josh, there was a GAO report out today that said the VA is still having significant problems fixing -- that veterans are still waiting long periods of time to get appointments in the health care system and that the Department has not solved the problem. Is the President frustrated at the pace of this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there is no denying that the problems that the VA has encountered for more than a decade now have been deeply entrenched. And there are critically important reforms that are having a positive impact and we have made important progress in ensuring that our veterans get the benefits that they have so richly earned. That said, there's more work that needs to be done to implement those reforms and to continue to accelerate the progress of those reforms. And that's something that VA Secretary McDonald is intensely focused on. He does that work with the strong support of the President, because President Obama has made this a priority, and we're committed to making sure that we serve our veterans well. And there's more work that needs to be done to make sure that we realize that goal.\nQ: The administration only has a few months left to tackle this problem. How confident is the White House that you're going to resolve it by the time you leave office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that there's no denying that in the first seven years of the Obama administration, that we have made remarkable progress in improving the service delivery system and drastically reducing the backlog and benefits claims. So that progress has been important. But there's nobody right now that's satisfied. We know that there's a lot more important work to be done. And when you're talking about making sure that the bravest Americans have gotten their due, have gotten what they were promised, that's an important priority. It's certainly one that this President takes very seriously, and he certainly is not going to be satisfied until all that work has gotten done.\nJohn, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The President obviously also has a lot of confidence in the Solicitor General who argued the case on behalf of the administration today. Did the President consult with Mr. Verrilli over the arguments that he was going to put forward before the Supreme Court today? And on the back end, did he get a debriefing from Mr. Verrilli about how things went today at the Supreme Court?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know how much conversation that they had prior to the arguments. I can tell you that the President will get a briefing from his staff before the end of the day today on how the arguments went. I don't know that Mr. Verrilli will offer that briefing in person, but it will be an opportunity for the President to hear how the case went.\nObviously, Mr. Verrilli is someone who has been through the wringer here several times and, I think by any assessment, is somebody that has a sterling track record, particularly on the most important cases in representing the federal government before the Supreme Court.\nSo the President's confidence in Solicitor General Verrilli is quite well earned, and that confidence in Mr. Verrilli and his abilities has paid off -- not just for the President, but for the American people who have enjoyed significant benefits from the Affordable Care Act, for example, as a result of Mr. Verrilli's effective advocacy before the Supreme Court.\nThanks, everybody.

Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign on Monday questioned \"serious apparent violations\" of campaign finance laws under a joint fundraising deal between Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\nThe questionable dealings were detailed in a letter from Brad Deutsch, the attorney for Sanders' campaign, to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC. The letter questioned whether the Clinton presidential campaign violated legal limits on donations by improperly subsidizing Clinton's campaign bid by paying Clinton staffers with funds from the joint DNC-Clinton committee.\nUnlike Clinton's presidential campaign committee, Hillary for America, the joint committee may accept large donations of up to $356,100. The first $2,700 of this amount is eligible for transfer to the Clinton campaign, $33,400 can be transferred to the DNC, with any remaining amount, up to $10,000, to each participating state party. According to public disclosure reports, however, the joint Clinton-DNC fund, Hillary Victory Fund (HVF), appears to operate in a way that skirts legal limits on federal campaign donations and primarily benefits the Clinton presidential campaign.\nThe financial disclosure reports on file with the Federal Election Commission indicate that the joint committee invested millions in low-dollar, online fundraising and advertising that solely benefits the Clinton campaign. The Sanders campaign \"is particularly concerned that these extremely large-dollar individual contributions have been used by the Hillary Victory Fund to pay for more than $7.8 million in direct mail efforts and over $8.6 million in online advertising\" according to the letter to the DNC. Both outlays benefit the Clinton presidential campaign \"by generating low-dollar contributions that flow only to HFA [Hillary for America] rather than to the DNC or any of the participating state party committees.\"\nThe questionable outlays \"have grown to staggering magnitudes\" and \"can no longer be ignored,\" Deutsch added.\nThe expenditures on advertising and fundraising are at best \"an impermissible in-kind contribution from the DNC and the participating state party committees\" to Clinton's presidential campaign, the letter said. \"At worst, using funds received from large-dollar donors who have already contributed the $2,700 maximum to HFA [Hillary for America] may represent an excessive contribution to HFA from these individuals.\"\nIn addition, the joint committee has paid the Clinton campaign committee $2.6 million ostensibly to \"reimburse\" the Clinton presidential campaign staff for time spent running the joint committee. The unusual arrangement, Deutsch said, \"raises equally serious concerns that joint committee funds, which are meant to be allocated proportionally among the participating committees, are being used to impermissibly subsidize HFA through an over-reimbursement for campaign staffers and resources.\"\n\"While the use of joint fundraising agreements has existed for some time — it is unprecedented for the DNC to allow a joint committee to be exploited to the benefit of one candidate in the midst of a contested nominating contest,\" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager.\nTo read the letter, click here.", "timestamp": "2016-04-18", "title": "Press Release - Clinton-DNC Joint Fundraising Raises Serious Campaign Finance Concerns"}

Bernie Sanders called on Congress to prioritize the needs of the people of Puerto Rico over the greed of Wall Street investors when addressing the island's financial crisis.\n\"We have a major economic and humanitarian crisis\" in Puerto Rico today, Sanders explained. \"Fifty-eight percent of children in Puerto Rico are living in poverty. Today, Puerto Rico has a debt of $73 billion and the solution to this crisis is not more austerity. Congress must act immediately to restructure the debt.\"\nRepublicans in Congress have proposed creating an unelected oversight board that would be given the power to make even more cuts to Puerto Rico's budget and raise taxes without the approval of the government.\nSanders has rejected the Republicans' proposal, arguing, \"We can not give in to the demands of vulture funds on the backs of those children\" who are living in poverty.\nInstead, Sanders' plan would grant Puerto Rico the same authority given to every municipality in the United States to restructure its debt under the supervision of a bankruptcy court. Importantly, if any of this debt was issued in violation of Puerto Rico's Constitution, it must be immediately set aside.\nIn addition to addressing the fiscal crisis, as president Sanders said he would create more than 150,000 good-paying jobs in Puerto Rico by enacting a national jobs program to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. He would also invest in clean energy on the island to lower fuel costs, create jobs and transition away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and renewable energy.\nThe political future of island \"is a decision for the people of Puerto Rico. There should be a referendum to let the people of Puerto Rico decide,\" Sanders said. \"We need to create a government that works for all of us, not the 1 percent.\"\nSanders roundtable discussion with leaders in New York's Puerto Rican community comes just hours before New Yorkers head to the polls.

And the main shopping area was Kings Highway. And if you went shopping there, you saw would see people who had serial numbers on their arms, which was from Hitler's concentration camps,\" Sanders says.\nThe densely populated and diverse community Sanders grew up in had a large impact on the way he sees the world today. He explains, \"The strength of this country is the fact that we have so much diversity. And I think that we do better when we are a people who appreciate, who love, respect people from all over the world who bring their own values and traditions and become part of the American experience.\"\nSanders goes on to discuss the lessons he learned from his parents — his father's experience as an immigrant and his mother's desire to provide a better life for her children.\nAsked about his role in anti-segregation efforts in Chicago, Sanders tells Ruffalo tells that he became involved out of \"a sense of justice.\"\nThe video ends with a discussion of Sanders' accomplishments as mayor of Burlington, where he put the city on the path to becoming one of the most progressive cities in America, and his time in Congress where he was dubbed the \"Amendment King\" for his unparalleled record of passing roll call amendments in the House.\n\"One of the beautiful parts of this campaign,\" Sanders concludes, \"is your dreams and my dreams, you may have thought there were very few of us.

Smith, R-MO, and nine cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4885, the IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending Act of 2016, which would reduce the resources available for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at a time when the IRS is severely underfunded. By further constraining IRS resources, H.R. 4885 would have detrimental effects on the IRS's ability to provide quality service to taxpayers, administer the tax code, and enforce tax laws.\nH.R. 4885 would repeal the IRS's longstanding legal authority to offset the cost of providing services to taxpayers with user fees. The IRS has had this authority since 1995, and charges user fees for a variety of services. Repealing this authority would reduce overall IRS resources by roughly 4 percent, compounding budget cuts that have left the IRS severely underfunded and reversing the limited progress the IRS has been able to make on taxpayer service levels this year after receiving a modest funding increase in fiscal year 2016. Even with this small increase, the IRS budget remains more than $900 million lower than it was in fiscal year 2010, before adjusting for inflation. These cuts cost the Nation billions of dollars each year in lost tax revenue and have been enacted despite the IRS's crucial and growing responsibilities to implement new mandates and enhance cybersecurity protections.\nThe IRS needs more resources, not fewer, to deter tax cheats, serve honest taxpayers, and protect taxpayer data. That is why the President's FY 2017 Budget would increase IRS funding by $530 million above the FY 2016 enacted level to protect the integrity of the tax system, fairly enforce the tax code, and provide adequate levels of taxpayer services. Unfortunately, H.R. 4885 would go in the opposite direction, further reducing the resources available to the IRS and undermining the fairness and integrity of the tax system in ways that would increase burdens on taxpayers, including by increasing the deficit.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4885, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-04-18", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 4885 – IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending Act of 2016"}

These bills would impose unnecessary constraints on the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) operations without improving the agency's ability to administer the tax code and serve taxpayers.\nH.R. 1206 would prohibit the IRS from hiring any new employees until the Secretary of the Treasury certifies that no IRS employee has a seriously delinquent debt, or provides a report to the Congress that includes an explanation of why certification is not possible and what would be required to provide such a certification. The bill could result in the IRS being prohibited from hiring any new employees for any purpose – a drastic and counterproductive step that would compromise tax administration and taxpayer services. The bill is also unworkable in operation, as \"seriously delinquent\" debts could be as low as $1 and tax liens are recorded on a case-by-case basis. This legislation is unnecessary, as strong laws and procedures already exist to ensure that IRS employees comply with their tax obligations. Publicly-available data show that IRS employees are among the most tax compliant groups in the Nation with a delinquency rate of less than 1 percent.\nH.R. 4890 would ban performance awards to IRS employees until the Secretary of the Treasury develops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy. This bill is unnecessary, as the IRS has already developed and has begun to execute a strategy to improve taxpayer services. The real constraint on the IRS's ability to serve taxpayers effectively is severe underfunding, including for taxpayer services. IRS funding is more than $900 million below its 2010 level, before adjusting for inflation. These budget cuts have impeded the IRS's ability to serve taxpayers, including inadequate responses to taxpayer calls and correspondence. Filing season statistics show that taxpayer service has improved this year as a result of a small funding increase provided last year, but more resources are needed to serve all taxpayers effectively and efficiently. Legislation constraining the IRS's ability to retain and recruit highly qualified employees is not needed and could be counterproductive to the Service's mission.\nH.R. 3724 would prohibit the IRS from rehiring any employee who was involuntarily separated due to misconduct. The bill as written could force the immediate termination of employees who had been terminated and rehired many years ago, even if their performance since rehiring has been blemish-free. The bill's prohibition is also unnecessary because current IRS processes already ensure the agency does not rehire former employees who had significant conduct or performance problems during prior employment with the agency.", "timestamp": "2016-04-18", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 1206 – No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act, H.R. 4890 – IRS Bonuses Tied to Measurable Metrics Act, and H.R. 3724 – Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2015"}

They used the \"Seinfeld\" skit to talk about how you'll be able to get these things done.\nYou know, how are you going to break up the big banks? Well, I'll sit them down, yada, yada, yada, I'll break them up.\nHow a big a problem do you think it is that people don't think, that group of voters that you want who don't think Bernie can't get it done. I know he believes it, it sounds great -- but he can't break up those banks, he can't get free college, it's too hard or he can't pay for it?\nSANDERS: Well, let me respond in this way. If you and I were sitting here and five years ago, not a long time. And I say, \"Chris, you know, I think the $7.25 federal minimum wage is a starvation rage. We have got to raise it to 15 bucks an hour.\"\nCUOMO: I was talking to you five years ago. You were saying that. [laughter]\nSANDERS: But most people would have thought that that was a crazy idea. Right? Fair enough? You wanted double the minimum wage.\nWell, guess what, California, New York, Los Angeles, Oregon have done it. Why? Because people stood up and fought for a $15 an hour wage and appealed to the conscience of the American people.\nSecond point, gay marriage. You are -- now, I would hear ten years ago, would you have believed honestly that gay marriage would be legal now in 15 states in this country? Probably not. I would not have.\nBut what happens when people stand up and say, we have got to end bigotry in America. People have a right to love whomever -- change takes place when people stand up and fight for change.\nThat is the kernel, the heart of what this campaign is about. And I believe everything that we're talking about. Nothing is radical. These ideas exist in other countries; they have existed in the United States. When you were a kid, how much did it cost to go to city university?\nIt was virtually...\nCUOMO: Under $1,000.\nSANDERS: There you go. Virtually tuition free. Why, if we could do it 30, 40, 50 years ago, can't we do it in America today? We can.\nBut what -- the truth is, is that the people on top have enormous economic and political power. I'm trying to change that dynamic.\nCUOMO: Bill Clinton on the hustings said, you know, look, I love that these young people are out there, they're being energized by Bernie Sanders. That's great.\nBasically his message to them is, if you kill one out of every three people who work on Wall Street, everything will be fine. You can -- look, that's politics. It's ugly, it's out on the hustings. That's no surprise.\nBut you know you have a problem with that group of people. I mean, you target the banks all the time as the seed of what's wrong with the capitalist system. They would say they are the capitalist system.\nWhat do you say to the entrepreneurs, to the young business people? Why would they vote for Bernie Sanders?\nSANDERS: Because you can run a business in a way that is profitable -- that's what businesses try to do -- treat your workers with respect and protect the environment.\nThere are thousands of businesses who are into social responsibility. Yeah, they want to make money. But they're not going to shut down today and move to China. They're not going to destroy the environment in order to do that.\nWhat we need -- and this is where we can learn something from the pope. That's what Pope Francis is talking about, he's morality, creating a world economy based on morality, not just on greed. I agree with him.\nCUOMO: But -- right. But when you use the pope as an analogy, the pope is not a politician, OK? He is shamelessly socialist in terms of his finding (ph). He is actually way beyond that.\nYou know, his signature expression of [in Spanish], \"make a mess,\" he wants to go out and challenge capitalism to be different and better. OK, that's the pope.\nSANDERS: Right.\nCUOMO: A president is not a pope any way you want to look at it. And that is what gives America all of its resources, all of its unique capabilities, all of its unique success, is that engine that you're now saying is broken -- and I get the disparity argument.\nYou would have to be blind not to see it. But do you wind up attacking what makes America great as part of an ability to make it better?\nSANDERS: I do not think that America is great when the leadership of major financial institutions engage in widespread fraud.\nSo, if your question -- I think what your question is, how are we going to create wealth without Wall Street? That's your question.\nCUOMO: Right.\nSANDERS: I think we can. And I think you can break up these large financial institutions...\nCUOMO: How?\nSANDERS: Well, you can do it through section 121 of Dodd-Frank. You go through my legislation. All you need is the secretary of Treasury to determine which banks, if they fail, will cause systemic damage to our economy.\nThat is not a hard to do.\nCUOMO: It exists now, though.\nSANDERS: That's right. The law exists now.\nCUOMO: So, why are we different?\nSANDERS: I will use it. Just because we can do it doesn't mean we are doing it.\nCUOMO: But they have the stress tests and the ongoing analysis now.\nSANDERS: And what happened recently? They failed -- five of the major banks failed their stress tests. Failed...\nCUOMO: Right.\nSANDERS: Yeah. So, what I'm saying is, I think when so few financial institutions have so much economic and political power, when their history in recent years has shown them that they're into fraud and illegal behavior, I do not think it is a good thing for the future of this country that they maintain the kind of size that currently have.\nCUOMO: Guns.\nSANDERS: Guns.\nCUOMO: Your early rationale on why certain sellers shouldn't be sued was, these are mom and pop shops. Don't go after a mom and pop shop for the fact that we don't like how guns are used in the hands of wrong people.\nThat's not what Newtown's lawsuit is about. Newtown is about going after the major manufacturers, not the mom and pops, and doing it for their marketing, that they promote the use of these things in video games and otherwise.\nWhy did you give such a quick no on that about whether or not they should be sued on that basis?\nSANDERS: Well, this is -- this is -- this is what I think.\nFirst of all, please understand that we, back in 1988, I ran a campaign for the United States Congress, the only candidate taking on the gun people to say, we should ban these assault weapons which are designed only to kill people.\nThat was my view then. That is my view now. I want to see that put away.\nWhat I believe right now is, yes, you're right about mom and pop stores. I sell you a gun legally, you go out and kill somebody. Should I be held responsible?\nCUOMO: Right.\nSANDERS: But this is what also believe. Is that if you walk into my shop and you want 10,000 rounds of ammunition -- oh, here it is, Chris, 10,000 rounds. That's pretty crazy. I should be held responsible.\nIf I am a gun manufacturer, selling guns into areas where I know they're ending up into the hands of criminals, I should be held liable for that as well, [inaudible].\nCUOMO: But the Newtown suit is, you put them into video games, you market them to the young, you tell people they're tools of empowerment, that they make you cool, they make you mighty.\nSANDERS: It's an ugly thing.\nCUOMO: And they want to sue. I'm not saying they would win the suit.\nSANDERS: Right.\nCUOMO: But do you think they should be able to sue?\nSANDERS: Obviously, they should and they are suing, and they want to...\nCUOMO: Well, you said no.\nSANDERS: Well, within a broader context. Do I think somebody should be held liable, is what I said, for selling a legal product? Should somebody have the right to sue and make their case? Of course they should.\nCUOMO: So, the Newtown families should be allowed to sue the manufacturers on the basis of marketing?\nSANDERS: They are doing that, they are doing that.\nCUOMO: And the judge said yes.\nSANDERS: Right.\nCUOMO: But many people said you were on the wrong side of that issue.\nSANDERS: Well, if what I said in my own personal view, if I sell you a legal product, do I -- am I liable for the crazy thing that you do with it? I think not.\nCUOMO: I help -- I'm trying to get you to clarify it, because it has been -- [inaudible] so much.\nSANDERS: All right. But should somebody have the right to sue? Anybody can sue for any reason. We'll see how the courts react to that suit.\nCUOMO: All right. Another issue that's going on right now, the G.I. bill. OK?\nSANDERS: Yeah.\nCUOMO: What's happening in Congress? They have a no roll call vote. Sneaky. Dirty pool already. They get through this bill that says the following: there is money that -- you know what the bill is. Just for you at home. There's money that they're taking that people from the military used to use for their dependents, that they weren't using themselves for housing allowance. It's money that they needed.\nNow Congress is saying, we're going to take that money, we're going to use it to fund other programs. The veterans, the IAVA, big associations are coming out and saying, \"Don't use the G.I. Bill as a piggybank.\"\nSANDERS: Right.\nCUOMO: \"Find your savings somewhere else. You already don't honor your commitment to the troops.\" Where are you on that bill?\nSANDERS: Yes. I agree with the veterans organization.\nCUOMO: Will you fight it?\nSANDERS: Absolutely, absolutely. Look...\nCUOMO: Because it's passing through right now.\nSANDERS: I know, I got to -- you know, my problem is, there are only 24 hours to a day. But the answer is, yes. The veterans are saying there is, there is money available in a dozen different ways.\nSome of these guys who are pushing this cut are the same people who want to give tax breaks to billionaires. In my view, that's pretty crazy. You have got to stand by the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us.\nYou do not make cuts in the housing allowance which people need.\nCUOMO: All right. Tone. It's becoming more and more subject to this.\nWe know that it is more critical, it's closer than people expected it to be, maybe even you included in that. So, part of that happens in politics.\nBut the concern is going to be, if you don't win and you wind up in the convention, you have a lot of followers who, in their mind -- I mean, you know when you're out there, they're not looking for anybody else.\nHow -- have you given a thought yet to what you would do if you don't get the nomination, to keep this massive group of people who believe in you with the party that you say you are beholden to, the Democrats?\nSANDERS: Well, it's -- first of all our major focus right now is trying to win.\nCUOMO: Is winning. I get it.\nSANDERS: But I got your question. And the question is that it's a two-way street. I mean, the Clinton people are also going to have to listen to what these people are fighting for.\nAnd the Clinton people are going to have to say, well, you know, maybe Bernie has a point, that we should not be the only major country on Earth to not guarantee health care to all people, or have paid family or medical leave.\nAnd maybe, yes, the billionaire class should start paying their fair share of taxes, and maybe yes, we should break up Wall Street.\nSo, it is a two-way thing. And it's not me; I don't control millions of people. But the Clinton campaign is going to have to make the case to those young people that, in fact, they are prepared to stand up for some real fundamental changes in this country.\nAnd that's a case they have not yet been able to make.\nCUOMO: You do not believe that the Clinton campaign has said, in any compelling way, that they have what that group of voters, whose hashtag, #feelingthebern, that they have the solutions for those people's problems?\nSANDERS: No, I really don't think they have. I mean, they're very good at rhetoric, and certainly, she has moved to the left in this campaign in response to many of the initiatives that we have brought forth.\nBut I think, not only our supporters, I think the average person understands that when you collect such large sums of money from Wall Street and other special interests, they have their doubts as to whether the Clinton people will stand up to these powerful forces.\nCUOMO: What did you think about the question from Wolf at the debate where he said, \"Can you point to one single vote, one single action...\nSANDERS: Yeah.\nCUOMO: ... that makes this allegation about her too closely tied to reality?\" She didn't have -- you didn't have one.\nSANDERS: Well, let me give you proof -- well, first of all, one is the bankruptcy bill that she ended up voting for, which was not a good piece of legislation.\nBut you see, the question suggests that, just because somebody gets campaign contributions, do they automatically respond? As you well know, it's more than that.\nSo, I'm not suggesting that money immediately results in a vote or -- either way.\nBut the more important issue, Chris, the point I did make, which I believe is the fundamental point, if we know -- and the evidence is not debatable -- that major Wall Street firms have been operating in a fraudulent manner. If we know that a handful of these firms have incredible economic and political power, should they be broken up?\nI began this campaign by saying, yes, too much economic and political power, too much fraudulent activity. Hillary Clinton has not come on board that point of view.\nCUOMO: Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you very much for making the time for \"New Day.\" Good luck tomorrow.\nSANDERS: Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-04-18", "title": "Interview with Chris Cuomo of CNN's \"New Day\""}

Our future is written in our classrooms, and on Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., we reaffirm our belief that no matter who they are, where they come from, or what they look like, every child deserves an education that will help them develop their unique talents and passions, dream beyond their present circumstances, and unlock their greatest potential.\nInvesting in the education of our daughters and sons is among the best investments we can make as a Nation. My Administration has worked to expand high-quality early education—something that can pay off over a child's entire lifetime—and we have proposed a plan to offer 2 years of free community college to anyone willing to work for it, because in America, a quality education cannot be a privilege reserved for a few. Last year, I was proud to sign the Every Student Succeeds Act—bipartisan legislation that will help prepare more of our young people to seize tomorrow's possibilities. By adopting higher academic standards, increasing accountability for underperforming schools, making testing more efficient, and empowering State and local leaders to develop their own systems for school improvement based on evidence, rather than impose piecemeal solutions to serious problems, this law provides schools across America with the resources and flexibility needed for students to thrive. And earlier this year, I announced Computer Science for All, a collaborative effort to give every child in America the opportunity to learn computer science, and in the time since, a growing coalition of businesses, school leaders, and State and local governments have joined this initiative.\nAs we continue to build strong foundations for our students here at home, we recognize those around the world who are prevented from obtaining a quality education. That is why my Administration launched the Let Girls Learn initiative, spearheaded by First Lady Michelle Obama, to help adolescent girls worldwide get the quality education they need to reach their full potential. Through this campaign, we are helping to break down barriers for girls across the globe and working to shift attitudes and beliefs, affirm the inherent dignity and worth of every child, and harness the power of our society to rise above our present obstacles to forge the future we know is possible.\nThe advances we have made in education are a result of the many educators, administrators, and advocates who have opened the doors of opportunity for countless young people. Today, we pay special tribute to Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, for his tireless devotion to extending access to education to more people—regardless of their gender or background. The Rebbe's lifetime of contribution imparts a reminder of the tremendous importance of making sure every child has the tools and resources they need to grow, flourish, and pursue their dreams. On this day, let us carry forward the Rebbe's legacy by recognizing the limitless potential of each young person and empowering the next generation to lead our country, and our world, toward an ever brighter tomorrow. Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 19, 2016, as Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-18", "title": "Proclamation 9425—Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2016"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117077", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:08 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I do not have any statements at the top, so we can go straight to your questions. Josh, would you like to start?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh. Ahead of this trip to Saudi Arabia, I wanted to start with this 9/11 legislation that's brought so much attention. You described yesterday the White House's opposition, or at least strong concerns about this and the context of this, the whole notion of sovereign immunity being at stake. But the backers of this bill say that that is really narrowly tailored to situations where there's a terrorist attack that kills an American on American soil. So isn't it a strawman to say that by supporting this legislation you're risking the whole system of immunity for governments?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, what you just described is a scenario where Congress would open up a loophole that would allow individual Americans, no matter how justified they are in having sustained harm, being given an opportunity to sue another country. And it certainly is plausible, Josh, that other countries, when they're implementing these laws, would not tailor them so specifically.\nAnd that does open up the United States to a unique degree of risk. And putting our country, our taxpayers, our servicemembers and our diplomats in legal jeopardy in that way is contrary to our interests. It's unwise, particularly when there is an alternative mechanism for us to resolve these kinds of issues with other countries. That's the essence of diplomacy.\nAnd I spent a little time talking yesterday about the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia. It is a relationship that is characterized by extensive counterterrorism cooperation. That cooperation enhances our national security and makes the American people safer. The Saudi government happens to think that it enhances the national security of their country as well and makes the Saudi people safer as well. That's why we're able to cooperate.\nIt does not mean that there are not differences between our two countries. There are substantial differences between our two countries. And the President does not hesitate to raise his concerns about those differences as well. I'm confident he'll do that in the context of the meetings that he's preparing for later this week. I think that is the point. That is the essence of our concern and that is the essence of our proposal for how these kinds of situations can be resolved moving forward.\nI was gratified to have someone tell me shortly before I walked out here that Speaker Ryan indicated that he at least had some more concerns with the way that this bill is structured because of the consequences it could have for the U.S. relationship not just with Saudi Arabia but with countries around the world.\nQ: But the consequence that you're concerned about as you describe is that other countries could pass legislation that's even broader than this bill in allowing these kinds of suits. Couldn't another country do that anyway regardless of what we pass here in the U.S.? How does the U.S. passing this narrowly tailored law open the floodgates to that kind of thing happening overseas?\nMR. EARNEST: Because, Josh, people follow the United States because of the example that we set. And that example that we set applies in a variety of contexts. It certainly applies when it relates to our values. People follow our example when it comes to the economic decisions that we make because we have such a strong economy that has yielded great benefits for our people. Other countries also follow our example when it comes to setting up legal structures.\nSo, again, I think this is the point -- that taking a step like this would significantly enhance the risk to the United States not in the context of our relationship with Saudi Arabia necessarily, but the concern that we have is much broader than that. Our concern is with our ability to do business in countries around the world. And sometimes it's not just related to economic business, but actually to the business of our national security, to the business of the functioning of the state -- whether that relates to national security operations, or in some cases, even humanitarian operations.\nQ: You said that we don't need to create this mechanism because we already have a mechanism to deal with this, mainly diplomacy. There's a group of 9/11 widows and widowers who support this legislation. ??They're very concerned. They've written to the White House asking to meet with the President. Do you think that those families of victims who have been waiting for a resolution to this for more than 15 years should feel that that diplomatic track that you described has served them well, has allowed them to pursue these claims the way that they should? And will the President agree to that request to meet with them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any presidential meetings to announce at this point. If a meeting like that occurs, we'll let you know.\nLet me just say, as I did yesterday, that there is no minimizing the profound pain that those Americans who lost loved ones on 9/11 have endured. And that's why this administration has been so committed to fighting for them, both when it comes to compensation for their loss, but also when it comes to fighting for health care benefits for those who risk their lives to try to rescue people who were victims of the 9/11 attacks or were engaged in the years-long effort to rebuild in the aftermath of those attacks. The Obama administration has been a leader in both of those efforts to advocate for those who lost so much on 9/11 and those who have been responsible for either rescuing people on 9/11 or leading the rebuilding process.\nI think what is also true, Josh -- and this is the conclusion of the 9/11 Commission, the outside blue ribbon panel that was tasked with taking an unvarnished look at exactly what happened on 9/11 -- their report indicates -- this is a report that was made public years ago -- their report indicates that there's no evidence that the Saudi government has an institution or that senior Saudi government officials knowingly supported the 9/11 plotters. That's just a fact.\nBut, presumably -- and I think we've heard a lot from the 9/11 families about what their significant policy concerns are -- certainly at the top of their list is our national security and protecting the American homeland and preventing the great tragedy that they have endured from afflicting other families. And this President has worked aggressively to enhance our national security, to make our homeland safer. And part of that has been through ramped-up cooperation with the Saudi government. That's the essence of diplomacy in terms of looking for ways to work with other countries to find common ground to advance our shared interests. And when it comes to the national security of the United States and the safety of our homeland, the President has been able to work effectively with countries around the globe, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in pursuit of that goal.\nQ: And the Vice President, in his speech to J Street last night, had some pretty harsh rebuke of the Israeli government, and he said sometimes we're outrageously frustrated by the Israeli government's policies leading Israel in the wrong direction. Does the President agree with those comments that the Vice President made?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the way that I would describe the situation is consistent with what the Vice President said, which is that the nation of Israel is the strongest ally that the United States has in the Middle East and we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them when it comes to the national security interests of our two countries. The United States provides tremendous assistance to the nation of Israel to ensure their security. And our commitment to that level of cooperation and that level of assistance has not wavered at all, despite what have been some obvious policy differences between our two governments.\nThat has been the President's approach to this critically important relationship. And I would just note that that is a longstanding tradition in American politics -- that Democratic and Republican Presidents alike have worked to ensure that the relationship between our two countries does not get mired in partisan politics. It's not a relationship that is somehow dependent on the political affiliation or political ideology of the leaders in either country, that the importance of our alliance transcends those narrower concerns. And President Obama hasn't just subscribed to that theory, he has put it into practice. And I think this is something that even Prime Minister Netanyahu -- again, despite some of our differences -- has, himself, acknowledged when he said that security cooperation between the United States and Israel under President Obama's leadership is unprecedented.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, what does the White House believe are the prospects of restarting diplomatic talks over the Syria crisis? And with those talks now having broken down, what are other options? Did the United States put all of its eggs in the diplomacy basket, as it were?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, obviously our approach to countering ISIL has included a multifaceted strategy that has included the not insignificant use of military force. But we have acknowledged all along that if our efforts were focused solely on military action that we would not be effectively pursuing our interests or achieving our goals anytime soon.\nWhat continues to be true is that the terrible situation that we see right now inside of Syria is a result of the failed leadership of President Bashar al-Assad. And that's why this administration has asserted for years that President Assad must go. And the kind of political transition that we'd like to see inside of Syria is long overdue, and we're going to continue to push both sides to engage constructively in a U.N.-led process to bring about that political transition. In fact, President Obama had a protracted conversation with President Putin yesterday about this precise topic. There's an opportunity for the Russians to use the influence that they have with the Assad regime to compel them to live up to the commitments that they've made in the context of the Cessation of Hostilities and continue to constructively participate in the U.N.-led political talks.\nSo this is something that the President is very focused on. The U.N. would point out it has not described the situation as breaking down. They have acknowledged that the talks have been postponed. But there still is a framework in place, and I believe that there are still technical discussions that are taking place in Geneva even as we speak.\nSo there still is a path forward here. And it's understandable that there is a frustration, to put it mildly, on the part of the opposition about the ongoing talks when we see repeated violations of the Cessation of Hostilities by the regime and supporting forces. We also see a continued tendency on the part of the regime to deprive some Syrians of badly needed humanitarian assistance.\nPart of the goal of the Cessation of Hostilities was to create space for humanitarian aid organizations to provide food, water and medicine to communities inside of Syria that have been deprived of those basic supplies for a long time. And we've seen the regime in too many instances either block those shipments or, in some cases, even prevent all of the material, all of the needed supplies from getting through.\nSo certainly the position of the opposition groups is understandable, given the refusal of the Assad regime to steadfastly live up to the commitments that they made in the context of Cessation of Hostilities. And that's why we're going to continue to make the case to the opposition that they should participate in the talks, that that is the path that will resolve the core of this issue. We're also going to continue to make the case to the Russians that they should use the influence they have with the Assad regime to compel them to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities and get back to the negotiating table in a constructive way.\nQ: I think the opposition would dispute the characterization the U.N. apparently is making that there is still a path forward through diplomacy. If you are unsuccessful in encouraging them to get back to the table, what is the other option?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, right now, this is the option that we are pursuing because this is the option that addresses the core of the problem. It is --\nQ: But if the talks don't continue? If they don't come back?\nMR. EARNEST: This is why we're going to continue to make the case that they should. And there are ongoing technical discussions that are underway even as we speak in Geneva, led by the U.N., by many of the parties. But there's more work that needs to be done. I'm not papering over the fact that there needs to be a recommitment to this process, but it certainly is understandable that the opposition would like to see a recommitment on the part of the Assad regime to the cessation of hostilities to pave the way for successful negotiations to continue.\nQ: And where -- aside from encouraging the rebels, what is the U.S. role at this point going forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Our role will continue to be to encourage all parties to live up to the cessation of hostilities. Unfortunately, we have seen just in recent days that that situation has frayed more rapidly. And that's a source of ongoing concern, particularly because it interferes with our ability to make progress in the political talks.\nWe'll continue to engage the Russians, we'll continue to engage all parties to use whatever influence they have, either with the regime or the opposition, to encourage both sides to come together and to participate in these U.N.-led conversations.\nBut there are other things that we can do, too. We can continue to work with the international community to apply even more pressure to ISIL. And Secretary Carter talked about some ideas the President had recently approved to step up that pressure inside of Iraq and certainly wouldn't rule out additional steps to ramp up the pressure against ISIL inside of Syria. As I mentioned, the President is always looking for suggestions from his national security team to increase the pressure on ISIL and the President is always looking for those ideas. And the President convened a meeting at the CIA just last week to discuss different elements of our proposal, and that is something that is happening on an ongoing basis.\nJim. Nice to see you today.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Good to be here. Couple questions on the immigration hearing yesterday before the Supreme Court. It seems as though both the justices and even the state of Texas conceded that, to your point of view, the White House point of view, that there's not enough money for the White House to deport all 11 million immigrants who are here, undocumented immigrants. But where it seemed to break down was that since they're already low priority, the ones among the 4 million that would be covered by the President's executive actions -- since they're already low priority for deportation, why do they need a special legal status, was -- seemed to be the question both from the bench and from Texans. Why are you pushing for that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the argument that we have made is actually one that many of our political opponents should actually be warm to. The argument that we have made is essentially that these individuals who are individuals that already have deep ties to this country -- in most cases, we're talking about individuals that are the parents of American citizens or are legal permanent residents to the United States, so these are people with deep ties and with deep family connections to the United States. That's why they're low priority. They're also individuals that have been here for several years already.\nBut the case that the Obama administration has made is we should bring them out of the shadows. The benefits of doing that are we can submit them to a background check, make sure that they're not dangerous criminals. If they are, then we can expedite them for deportation. We also can put them in a situation in which they're paying taxes. That also is good for our economy. It's good for reducing the deficit.\nWhen we talk about bringing much-needed accountability to our broken immigration system, right now you have individuals who are low-priority candidates for deportation. In many cases, they haven't been subject to a background check. In many cases, they're not paying taxes right now. So let's add some accountability to the system. Let's bring them out of the shadows. Let's make them pay taxes. Let's make them subject -- let's subject them to a background check. That will enhance the security of our country. It will improve our economy. It will improve our fiscal situation.\nIt also will give them the peace of mind to come out of the shadows. That also will send a clear signal to our law enforcement that we need to be focusing our efforts not just -- not on families, but on felons. And that is the rationale that we have put together, and that's why the proposal that we have put forward makes so much policy sense. It's good for our security; it's good for our economy; and it's good for having a system that's in mind with our values, both in terms of following the law, but also acknowledging that our heritage in this country is as a nation of immigrants. All of this policy is structured in that direction.\nIt's why, frankly, the critics of this law have a really tough case to make. And it's why even people like Senator Rubio have described the current system that we have in place that doesn't require undocumented immigrants to pay taxes, it doesn't require them to submit to a background check. That's why Senator Rubio described the current system as the closest thing that we have to amnesty.\nAnd that's the argument that we've made, and that's why as a policy matter we believe this argument is quite potent. I understand that a different kind of argument is being made before the Court. It's one that's rooted in the President's legal authority to order this action. We feel we can have that argument on quite strong grounds as well.\nQ: Is what the President wants to do, though, an unfair burden on states like Texas and, apparently, the other 25 who are complaining, in that -- in the case of Texas, what they're saying is that they'll have 400,000 people that they're going to have to give driver's licenses to, and that that's going to cost them more money, they're going to have to bring in more people. Isn't that something that the federal government should be considering?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say -- I'll say two things about that. The first is the chief law enforcement officials in the state of Texas don't agree with the Attorney General of Texas. They happen to take the same position that the Obama administration does. These are law enforcement officials in the largest counties in the state -- Dallas County, Austin, Texas, which is in Travis County, Dallas County -- all agree that this actually -- that the policies that the President has put forward would make their communities safer. They are strongly supportive of the system that would bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows and submit them to a background check.\nThese law enforcement officials who are responsible for the safety of their communities understand that would make their communities safer. That's a good thing.\nThe other thing is I also happen to know about Texas -- Texas is a state that relies on income taxes and on sales taxes for its -- let me take it back, not on income taxes, but on sales taxes and on business taxes for their revenue base. Their revenue base would be enhanced if you had undocumented immigrants as a part of the system and paying taxes. It certainly would be good for the federal government, but there would be cascading benefits for states as well.\nAnd that's the argument that we have made, particularly when it comes to these questions about public safety -- leading public safety professionals, law enforcement officials in the state of Texas do not agree with the Texas Attorney General. They do agree with the Secretary of Homeland Security and President Obama, who believe that these undocumented immigrants should be subjected to a background check.\nQ: Just one more on a different subject, and that is on this trip that the President is on. It was announced yesterday that he would visit not only the head of state of Britain, the Queen, which seems like that's justifiable, but that the President and Mrs. Obama would also have a lunch with Prince William and his wife. What's the justification for that? Is that something American taxpayers should be paying for? Is this just a celebrity get-together?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, the President is traveling to London and will spend a couple of days in the United Kingdom doing some important work, meeting with one of our closest allies, a country with whom we have a special relationship, to advance our national security interests. And in the President's extensive conversations with Prime Minister Cameron, they'll be focused on a range of issues related to the global economy, related to climate change, and certainly related to counterterrorism and homeland security that are critical to our national interests.\nPresident Obama has found Prime Minister Cameron to be an effective interlocutor and an effective partner in accomplishing goals that have been prioritized by both our countries. So this is an important trip. What's also important was the President also spend some time meeting with other leaders in the United Kingdom. And the President is looking forward to the opportunity that he'll have to have lunch with the Queen, but also to have a nice dinner with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. It certainly is an important part of public diplomacy, but I think it will be one of the more pleasant aspects of the trip that the President is certainly looking forward to.\nQ: Can I follow up on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll come back to you.\nChip.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Yesterday, you talked about the 28 pages and the fact that the President has basically said that it's in the hands of DNI Clapper right now. But after the briefing yesterday, Charlie Rose interviewed the President and he asked him if had read the 28 pages and he said, \"I have a sense of what's in there.\" I think it's safe to assume that means he hasn't read them yet. And if I said why hasn't he read them, I'm sure you would tell me, because it's in the hands of Clapper. But will he eventually read these 28 pages? And there's a sense coming out of just in some of the chatter around Washington and online, there's a sense that the White House is downplaying these 28 pages -- number one, by the President saying, \"I have a sense of what's in there\" -- and also the President said to Charlie Rose, \"I try not to personally get engaged in each and every decision that's being made on classification.\" Well, this isn't just each and every decision. As we discussed yesterday, this is a pretty important declassification decision. Is the White House downplaying it? Is he going to read them eventually? And will this be his decision in the end, or will he simply follow Clapper's advice?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what the President was referring to in his conversation with Charlie Rose is the fact that he's been briefed about the contents of those 28 pages, and the President noted, as I did yesterday, that there's a well-established process for the intelligence community to do a careful review to determine which, if any, of those pages can be released to the public without damaging our national security. There's a well-established process for considering what I would acknowledge are important questions.\nI don't think there's been an attempt by anybody at the White House to downplay this effort. In fact, I think there's been a concerted attempt by everybody at the White House to make sure that this follows the standard process. I think that is what the American people would expect when we're talking about something as significant as information related to the terror attacks of 9/11.\nSo I think the President is reiterating the position that I tried to articulate yesterday, which is that there's a well-established process for considering these questions, and that's the process that we're following. At this point, I think it's too early to say whether or not the President would weigh in on that process. I think he told Charlie that he was reluctant to because there is such a well-established process for considering these questions. Our intelligence community understands what's necessary to protect the American public. They also understand that there is a legitimate public interest in more of this information being made public if it can be. And that's the question that they're working through right now as it relates to these materials.\nI'll just reiterate that there is already extensive public material that has been made public by the 9/11 Commission -- that is a separate body but an outside, blue ribbon entity -- that took a close look at what happened in the run-up to 9/11, laid out a whole series of reforms that should be implemented to ensure that something like that never happens again. And that report was quite clear about the evidence that they found and didn't find about what led to the terror attacks of 9/11.\nAnd what they concluded I think merits repeating, which is that they found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or that senior Saudi government officials knowingly supported the 9/11 plotters. That is an important fact. And there certainly is public interest in understanding that fact. That report has been available for years now.\nQ: Just one more follow-up from that interview. The President at one point said, \"The single most important question I'm asked these days from other world leaders is 'What's going on with your elections?'\" Have you been present when the President has explained what's going on with our elections to other leaders? Or do you know from talking to others -- what is the President's answer to that question when he's talking to foreign leaders?\nMR. EARNEST: The kind of question that the President gives in those settings is the same kind of answer that he's given publicly when asked that question. Look, it's not just -- and I think the President makes this point in the interview as well -- the President doesn't just get this question from people overseas. This is the kind of question that's on the mind of Americans across the country right now as well. And I don't think there are any easy answers to it.\nThe reason that the President raised it in the context of this interview is he was asked, given all of the built-in advantages that we have as a country -- we've got an economy that's the envy of the world, we've got a military that is stronger than any other military in the history of the planet, we have a society and a culture that other countries and other cultures and other populations find remarkably attractive -- that gives us a lot of influence around the world. All those are good things. And the question is, where is the source of our potential downfall?\nAnd the argument that the President has made on a number of occasions, publicly and privately, both at home and overseas, is that our greatest risk -- or the significant risk here, given that dynamic, lies within the dysfunction of our politics. We need to continue to demonstrate an ability to manage all those advantages and preserve that edge.\nQ: Does that apply to both parties?\nMR. EARNEST: The President acknowledged that that was the case. I think the best example of this is -- there is a tendency, particularly when the United States has so many built-in advantages over other countries, which is to turn inward and to suggest that we should try to keep people out, or that we should build walls, or that we should not seek to engage countries around the world. That is exactly the wrong response -- that if we want to continue to cultivate all of the advantages that we have, we need to look for opportunities to more deeply engage around the world. That will enhance our national security. That will make our economy even more vibrant and filled with opportunity than it already is.\nThere is no doubt that there's a strain of that argument that's being advanced by politicians in both the Democratic and Republican Party. And the President has advocated a different approach, and at least in the context of our elections, the President will have numerous opportunities, I expect, to make an argument to the voters about the path that he has chosen to pursue, which is to more deeply engage the world and continue to build the kind of multilateral relationships that are critical to the continued strength of our economy and that are surely critical to our ongoing efforts to advance our interests around the world, to protect our national security and to protect our homeland.\nGregory.\nQ: Thank you. Lisa Monaco gave a speech last month in which she promised more transparency on civilian casualties for U.S. airstrikes. Can you give us an update on where that is? She said it would be coming in upcoming weeks, but that was six weeks ago.\nMR. EARNEST: This is something that the administration is still working on. And it has been a few weeks since she's given her speech, but I don't have an update for you in terms of the time frame, when something like that might be released. But we'll certainly keep you posted.\nQ: Pentagon officials are telling us that there have been some rules -- changes in the rules of engagement against the Islamic State that give the authorization for airstrikes to commanders closer to the field, and that there's now sort of a sliding scale on how many civilian casualties are acceptable -- up to 10, depending on the value of the target, the imminent threat posed by that target, et cetera. Did the President authorize these changes to the rules of engagement? And how do you square those with his attempts to sort of balance prosecution of the war against the Islamic State with upholding the American values he talks about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have a detailed assessment of the rules of engagement to share with you right now. The Department of Defense can most effectively talk about that. What I can tell you is that there has been a principle that our country has long subscribed to that the President believes is a priority, which is that a blunt assessment of both moral questions and strategic questions lead to the conclusion that the Department of Defense of the United States of America goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties.\nAgain, I think the moral questions that are inherent there are obvious and important. But what's also true is that the United States military undertaking operations in the Middle East that result in the death of innocent civilians only makes it harder to accomplish our goals. And that's why you've seen our national security officials be justifiably proud of the great lengths that we've gone to to avoid those civilian casualties, certainly to greater lengths than our adversaries in this conflict. And it's why the administration continues to look for ways to be more transparent about those efforts.\nThere is a regular process, Gregory, that I know you've taken note of, where the Department of Defense makes regular public declarations about the results of specific operations. And those results include an accounting of potential impacts on noncombatants. And this kind of accountability and transparency is something that the President believes is consistent with our values and is important. It's something the Department of Defense continues to do, and something that the President is seeking to expand upon. And it's an important part, as I was mentioning to Chip, of why the United States and our values continue to give us important credibility around the world.\nAnd when we undertake operations or engage in tactics that undermine our values, that undermines our national security. That's exactly why the President, for example, outlawed the use of torture during his first week in office, because of the impact that has on both moral questions, but also on broader national security considerations about living up to the high values that we've established for ourselves.\nSuzanne.\nQ: I want to go back to the Vice President's comments yesterday in criticizing Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister there. He said, \"the present course Israel is on is not one that is likely to secure its existence as a Jewish democratic state. We have to make sure that happens.\" And then he goes on to say that it is -- he expresses overwhelming frustration. You talked about the unshakeable bond between the U.S. and Israel, but can you talk about whether or not the President shares the Vice President's sentiments, the feelings of overwhelming frustration on the Israeli part of the government that has not promoted this peace accord?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Suzanne, I think what is true is that this administration, particularly Secretary Kerry and Vice President Biden and President Obama, have all expended significant time and energy and resources to facilitating conversations between the Israelis and Palestinians to find a two-state solution. That is a policy that American Presidents in both parties have pursued, and none have pursued it more aggressively than this administration.\nYou'll recall a couple of years ago that -- as my colleague, Jen Psaki, can attest, when she worked with the State Department -- that Secretary Kerry was a frequent visitor to that region in trying to bring all sides, particularly the Israelis and Palestinians, to the negotiating table in a constructive fashion that could yield a constructive result. Unfortunately, that progress didn't materialize. And that is a source of significant frustration.\nThere certainly is frustration with both sides that we have encountered. But we've also been clear that -- and this is what Vice President Biden I think is ultimately talking about here -- the United States has long supported the idea of a two-state solution because it has a potential to resolve one of the most combustible flashpoints in an already volatile region of the world. But it also happens to be in the clear strategic interest of our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel.\nSo resolving this question is not just a wished-for legacy item of the administration. It is a position that we take and advocate for because of our sincere concern for the national security of our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel. That's what we're focused on. And the inability to make that progress is frustrating. And that's what Vice President Biden was giving voice to yesterday.\nQ: In light of that frustration, is the President resigned that a two-state solution or peace between the Israelis and Palestinians will not happen under his administration?\nMR. EARNEST: It is, and that's something that we've expressed in the past, that this is not something that's likely to happen while President Obama remains in office. The extent of the differences between the two sides are significant enough that it's not something that's going to get resolved in the next nine months.\nQ: And on the legislation, the 9/11 legislation, both Democratic candidates who are fighting for the presidency, the nomination, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, support the legislation that would allow those victims of 9/11 to sue foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia if they were, in fact, involved in those attacks. In light of the fact that you said the President and the administration feel that that's a dangerous precedent, is the President concerned at all that they -- if they were in office would go ahead and support that legislation that you say is so dangerous to the administration and its relationship with other foreign countries?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let the individual candidates explain the position that they have on this legislation. Obviously, we've had an opportunity in here, for better or worse, to discuss our position on this legislation extensively. As I noted, I was gratified to see Speaker Ryan indicate his shared concern about the potential unintended consequences of this bill.\nSo we're going to continue to make our case to members of Congress and help people understand that what some might view as a way to offer support and well-deserved assistance to those families who lost so much on 9/11, there are significant, serious, unintended consequences that would endanger principles that the United States significantly benefits from.\nQ: So why would there be daylight between the President and his former Secretary of State regarding something that's so critical to the United States' relationships with other foreign leaders on this issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think I've gone to great lengths to try to help you understand exactly what our position is. I would encourage you to check with Secretary Clinton's team for an explanation of why she's taken the position that she has.\nQ: It's different than the administration. Is there any concern from the President that if you had a Democratic President following him, that something as important and potentially damaging to U.S. relations, as you say, with other leaders would move forward?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that's a hypothetical. This is something that's still being debated in Congress, and the presidential election is still something that's the subject of intense debate on the campaign trail as well.\nWhat we're focused on right now is continuing to make the case to the public and to Congress what our concerns with this legislation are.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. In addition to Speaker Ryan's concerns about the bill, Senator Graham has blocked the legislation in the Senate by placing a hold on it. Is the White House encouraged that there maybe seems to be some momentum behind blocking this bill in Congress? And what is the White House doing to try to cultivate some more support to try to stop the bill from happening?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of any presidential-level conversations about this legislation that have come up with members of Congress, but I know that there have been senior members of the administration, including White House officials, who have been in touch with senior officials on Capitol Hill about our concerns. We certainly are interested in a dialogue on this issue.\nAnd, look, in the current political climate, bipartisan support is rare. But I think in this instance, it's an indication of just how significant these questions are. And we're obviously gratified that there are other Republicans who have taken a close look at this legislation and recognized the serious, unintended consequences that could result from its passage.\nJC.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. As the President and First Lady lunch with Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday at Windsor Castle, it is the day after the Queen's 90th birthday, now the longest-reigning monarch in British history. What special birthday wish might the President be giving the Queen from the American people as a special tribute to this very historic day?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President will have an opportunity to speak to all of you during his visit to London. He'll do a news conference with Prime Minister Cameron at the conclusion of their meeting, and I suspect the President will be given an opportunity to offer his public birthday wishes in the context of that news conference.\nSo I don't want to speak for him too extensively, but the President has had an opportunity to spend time with Queen Elizabeth on a variety of occasions, and each time the President has come away with an even deeper personal affection for her. She is an important symbol of a country with whom the United States has a special relationship. But she also is a human being whose charisma and a sense of nobility and honor that is something that I think people around the world are attracted to. And that is something that she conveys not just on the broad public stage but it's also something that is evident in the President's personal interactions with her.\nAnd I think that's an important part of why the President has enjoyed every opportunity that he has had to spend some time with her in private, and it's certainly why he's looking forward to his Friday afternoon lunch.\nQ: Certainly a lot to learn from someone who's been around for so long and through so much.\nMR. EARNEST: She certainly has seen as much human history from a rather unique perspective as anyone else.\nQ: Another question about the Vice President's remarks about J Street last night, very critical of Prime Minister Netanyahu. What good does it do anybody for the Vice President to make Israel, our ally, into a villain?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would vigorously disagree with that description of what Vice President Biden said. I think Vice President Biden himself, just having completed a trip to Israel just within the last four or six weeks here, is somebody who understands the importance of the relationship between our two countries. In fact, it was on a trip that Vice President Biden took to Israel in the first term that Prime Minister Netanyahu indicated that the security cooperation between the United States and Israel under President Obama's leadership was unprecedented.\nSo I think what is also true is that when you have a strong relationship with your allies, you can also comfortably disagree in public. And there are areas of disagreement as a matter of policy between our two countries. And we certainly have gone to great lengths to try to resolve those differences. Prime Minister Netanyahu himself has not hesitated to make his own differences with the Obama administration public on, in some ways, the largest stage imaginable, which is by addressing a joint session of Congress.\nSo I think that's an indication of the fact that our two nations and even the leaders of our nations can disagree on some critically important policy issues in a way that doesn't undermine the fundamentals of our alliance and the importance of our security cooperation.\nQ: What about the timing, though? Because the Vice President's criticism came just a couple hours after a bus bombing in Israel, two dozen people were injured. How would the White House like it if just hours after a terrorist attack here, Israeli officials came out and had some not so nice things to say about you guys?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this particular incident -- by \"you guys,\" I assume you mean all Americans --\nQ: White House officials.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the point here is that Vice President Biden is somebody who has dedicated his career to strengthening the alliance between our two countries. And he certainly has succeeded in doing that. He did that in his visit to that country just a month or so ago. And our policy differences do not in any way overshadow our ongoing commitment to an unbreakable alliance and a security relationship that is unwavering.\nQ: And last question. On Friday, the Paris climate agreement is going to be signed. What should American citizens expect to see different on Saturday after this thing has been signed? Is there going to be a tangible benefit to everyday Americans that they're going to see? Or is this more just a step toward making us look good in front of the rest of the world?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what this is is this is another example of American leadership; that there will be a substantial number of countries, including some with large economies, joining the United States in making a serious international commitment to fighting climate change and to fighting carbon pollution.\nAnd this has long-term benefits for future generations of Americans. It also has shorter-term benefits for significant economic policy decisions that have been made in this country. This is going to open up a global market for the kind of renewable energy technology that is -- that U.S. companies are at the cutting edge of. This will open up a market for energy efficiency innovation that U.S. companies have pioneered. And no longer will they be in a position of essentially being a small sliver of the energy market. We know that now countries around the world, because of the policy commitments that they have made, are going to be looking to invest in that kind of technology.\nAnd that's why it has significant growth potential for our economy back here at home. It has the potential to create jobs in a brand new industry. And it certainly is something that the President is quite enthusiastic about, both in terms of its long-term impact on our planet, but also its more medium-term impact on our economy.\nJim.\nQ: I'd like to go back to the President's decision to deploy -- or approval to deploy the 217 Special Operations Forces there in Iraq in an attempt to accelerate the offensive against ISIS there. For the first time, these U.S. Special Forces will be permitted to embed at the battalion level, which means they will not be behind the fences and the defenses of an encampment somewhere, but they will be much closer to the front lines. And yesterday, in his interview with Charlie Rose, the President even said that those U.S. Special Operations Forces would be backing up the Iraqi forces. And it's somewhat unrealistic to believe that when the shooting starts, the Special Operations Forces are just going to retreat and watch it happen.\nAnd one of the real concerning issues about this is the American people would not even know that the U.S. Special Operations Forces would be engaged in combat unless they're wounded or killed, because the military is not going to announce that. Is this a little bit of fudging? The U.S. military is not going to be involved in combat? Because all the earmarks and recent experiences indicate that they will likely be.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jim, we've gone to -- I think we have been pretty blunt about the significant risks that our servicemen and women in Iraq are taking to protect our national security. And there's not been an attempt at any point to downplay the significant of the operations that they're undertaking.\nThat's true if you're talking about our military pilots who are flying combat operations. There are some 10,000 or 11,000 airstrikes that have now been taken against ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria. This is true of Special Operators who have been formed and stationed throughout Iraq to carry out raids when an opportunity presents itself to try to take out a senior ISIL figure or to capitalize on a treasure trove of intelligence that may be there for the taking.\nThis is also true when you talk about our military servicemembers who are engaged in training efforts. In some cases, particularly earlier in our efforts, you have U.S. military members who were in dangerous parts of Iraq who were working to try to train fellow Iraqis to make them more effective on the battlefield against ISIL.\nWe have not at all tried to downplay the significance of those operations, or the risks that those individual members are taking, or of the bravery that they are displaying when carrying out their mission. What is true is that when these kinds of operations are undertaken, the decisions to commence the operations are made by the Iraqi government and leaders in the Iraqi military, that the operations are focused on being carried out by Iraqi forces. Those forces, though, are supported by the United States military. In some cases, that is supported by U.S. military pilots that are conducting airstrikes in support of their operations. In other cases, that is Special Operators who are in proximity who can offer advice about specific tactics that can be employed on the battlefield to make the completion of their operation more likely to be successful.\nSo there is an important role for U.S. servicemembers to carry out, and it is a role that requires bravery. It is a role that requires a willingness to assume some risk. But it is different than the kind of combat mission that previous U.S. military servicemembers were asked to undertake in the invasion of Iraq back in 2003.\nQ: But you would acknowledge then that it's likely or very possible that those forces could indeed be involved in ground combat even though that's not their primary mission?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the way that we have described the situation is that they are engaged in missions that can be described as offering advice, assistance, and in some cases, training to Iraqi forces. That is different from a mission that is exclusively focused on combat. But we have never -- and I certainly am not going to start from here -- seek to downplay how dangerous and how much bravery is required to carry out the kind of advice and assistance missions that our servicemembers are undertaking on a daily basis in Iraq right now.\nQ: Also, in his interview with Charlie Rose, his remarks are being widely interpreted that the President meant to say that, given this acceleration of U.S. participation in assisting the Iraqi forces, that Mosul would fall by the end of the year. Did the President mean to say that? And does he believe that?\nMR. EARNEST: I looked at this portion of the transcript, too. I think what the President was trying to make the case for is to set expectations that we're hopeful that the conditions could be created where Mosul could fall this year.\nBut what the Iraqi forces have been engaged in for some time now is essentially undertaking operations in the area around Mosul to sort of lay the groundwork for a more significant operation. And those kinds of shaping missions have been underway for quite some time. They are at work trying to create the conditions where Mosul could fall. And that work to create those conditions is work that continues.\nObviously this is significant because Mosul is one of the two areas where ISIL has concentrated their fighters and concentrated a bunch of their organization in a way that allows them to project some power and violence that poses a longer-term threat and a broader threat to the United States and our interests around the globe.\nPam.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Could I just clarify something? You said at least three times that I've heard, quoting from the 9/11 Commission Report, the line about how there's no evidence that the Saudi government or high-level officials supported al Qaeda. And Senator Bob Kerry, who was on that commission, said flatly, \"We did not exonerate the Saudis.\" When you quote that line are you saying that the White House believes that the Saudis were exonerated?\nMR. EARNEST: No, Pam, what I'm merely doing is -- let's back up. The reason I have quoted that line frequently is because the suggestion has been raised that by refusing to release 28 pages of classified material that your network has been talking about is somehow a secret attempt to cover up verified, damaging information about the complicity of the Saudi government in the 9/11 attacks.\nAnd what I have been trying to do is to point you to the conclusion that was reached by this independent, blue ribbon panel that took an unvarnished look at what happened in the lead-up to 9/11 and what steps should be implemented in the aftermath of 9/11 to make sure that it would never happen again. And so pointing to their conclusion that was made public years ago and continues to be available for public review I think is relevant to a discussion about whether or not there's an ulterior motive to this question about the 28 pages.\nQ: But what do you think that phrase means? What does that mean to you?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think people can take a look at the report and draw their own conclusions, based on people who looked at reams of evidence. The 9/11 Commission was given extensive access to information and materials that were relevant to their investigation. These were individuals that had expertise in national security and intelligence matters. They were in a position to evaluate the evidence. They were in a position to examine the evidence. They were in a position to consider where they should look to find evidence. And they wrote a report that was made public so that everybody could see it and draw their own conclusions. And so what I have done is tried to point you to their conclusions because I think they're relevant to the question about whether or not these 28 pages are going to be declassified.\nBut I obviously haven't done the kind of investigation that they did, so I think what I would encourage people to do is if you have questions about whether or not the Saudi government as an institution or senior officials in the Saudi government were complicit in knowingly assisting the 9/11 plotters, one piece of evidence that they should know is that the blue ribbon panel that took a close look at this did not find any evidence to indicate that that was the case. And that's their conclusion. They certainly have the standing to make that conclusion. If there are people that want to ask different questions or seek additional evidence, they certainly are entitled to do that, but the conclusion of this particular commission I think is relevant to the questions.\nQ: As far as the suggestion that there's some damaging information in the 28 pages, former Senator Bob Graham was asked, what do you believe -- who in Saudi Arabia is responsible, government, charities, wealthy Saudis? And he said, \"All of the above.\" So he clearly believes that there was some involvement by the Saudi government and that the 28 pages points to that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I haven't read the 28 pages, so -- and even if I had I wouldn't be in a position to talk about them because they're currently classified. But we don't have to go over this territory again. I think what is relevant is that there was this blue ribbon commission, the 9/11 Commission, that did take a look at it and they've made public their conclusions. So people can certainly evaluate those opinions and those conclusions and draw their own conclusions accordingly.\nLet me just say something else that also happens to be true. It's undeniable that since 9/11 we have seen the Saudi government focus more intently on combating and countering those who propagate extremist ideology. If it wasn't clear to them before, it is certainly clear to them in the aftermath of 9/11 how dangerous that is. And we certainly have welcomed the efforts of the Saudi government to counter the propagation of that ideology.\nAnd that is just one sign of the improved security cooperation between the United States and Saudi Arabia since 9/11. It certainly does not eliminate all of the disagreements that we have between our two countries, but it is an indication that since 9/11, because of important work that was done both by the Bush administration and by national security professionals in this administration, that the relationship between our two countries has been enhanced in a way that has had important benefits for our national security.\nQ: And if the 9/11 families cannot sue the Saudi government, what other recourse do they have? Is diplomacy -- can that do something to satisfy what they would like to see happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I mentioned, Pam, I'll let the 9/11 families speak for themselves. Obviously they can set their own priorities in terms of what they would like to see. I know that just reading the public comments of many of those individuals, they're quite concerned about American national security, about protecting the U.S. homeland and making sure that a tragedy on the scale of 9/11 never happens again.\nAnd what is true is that by using diplomacy -- not just with Saudi Arabia but with countries around the world -- the United States is safer than we were on 9/11; that we have made progress. Osama bin Laden no longer threatens the American people. Core al Qaeda has been decimated. We have made progress in applying significant pressure to al Qaeda affiliates around the globe. We have deepened our security cooperation and our counterterrorism cooperation with countries around the globe -- not just in the Middle East, but also in places like Africa and Southeast Asia.\nI'm not seeking to downplay the risks. It's precisely because these risks exist that the administration has been so vigorous in countering them. And I think that is a policy priority and a set of policy accomplishments that anybody who is concerned about U.S. national security would be pleased about.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Secretary Carter is in the UAE today in advance to the President's trip to that region. I'm wondering if we should expect any announcements at the GCC summit about future, further commitments by GCC countries in the counter-ISIS efforts.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know whether or not Secretary Carter is prepared to make any announcements today. Obviously the leaders of those countries and President Obama will have an opportunity to meet in Riyadh, starting tomorrow. And that will be -- actually, starting on Thursday. My days -- this overnight flight thing has really got me confused. President Obama will arrive in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. On Thursday, he will convene a series of meetings with GCC leaders, including the leader of Saudi Arabia, to talk about a range of important national security priorities. And you all will have an opportunity to hear from President Obama at the conclusion of those meetings, and he'll be in a position to talk to you about any progress that we've made in the context of those negotiations.\nQ: I wanted to ask about Afghanistan. There was a car bomb that killed several dozens of people and injured hundreds in Kabul. And the Taliban has said that that's a sign of a new fighting season where there will be more and more of these attacks. I'm wondering, first, what the response is from the White House? And whether or not that factored into the President's decision on whether to draw down the troops at the same time schedule that he put out last year by going down to 5,500 by the end of this year.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that the United States strongly condemns the cowardly attack on Afghan forces and civilians in Kabul this morning that killed dozens and wounded hundreds. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and their loved ones.\nAt the outset of this year's fighting season, we remain committed to support the Afghan people and their government. We also call on the Taliban to pursue a pathway of peace instead of continuing a military campaign responsible for the senseless deaths of Afghan civilians. We remain steadfast partners with Afghan security forces as we work to promote peace and stability in the region and as we counter the threat of terrorism that affects all of us.\nI don't have an updated assessment in terms of what if any impact this attack would have on our military posture going forward. Obviously the President had an opportunity to talk about this at the end of last year. And this will be among the important policy decisions that the incoming President, President Obama's successor, will have to make.\nWhen President Obama took office, you'll recall, in 2009, he did so vowing to follow through on a campaign promise to ensure that we were -- that the United States and the international community was focused on the terror threat that was emanating from this region of the world. And the sense was -- not just the sense of President Obama, but also the sense of the American people -- was that our attention had drifted from Afghanistan and been diverted to the situation in Iraq. President Obama vowed to recalibrate that situation and to ensure that we were reinforcing our efforts in Afghanistan and in that region of the world where we know the al Qaeda leadership, under the protection of the Taliban, had carried out the 9/11 attacks against the United States.\nPresident Obama has executed a military and diplomatic strategy that has decimated core al Qaeda, that took Osama bin Laden off the battlefield, and that has supported an Afghan government that is committed to the kind of security approach that we're supporting.\nSo there's no denying that tremendous progress that we have made in Afghanistan, it has made America safer. But there is -- there are years of work, decades of work that still needs to be done in that region of the world to continue to advance our national security interests.\nQ: One more quickly on the $10 bill. I'm wondering -- there are reports that the Treasury Secretary will be making an announcement, and I'm wondering has the White House, has the President been briefed? Have you seen a mock-up of what the new bill might look like? Should we be expecting an announcement on that soon?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a policy decision that's made by the Treasury Department. It, of course, is not at all uncommon for the Treasury Department to consult with the White House where appropriate when making important policy decisions. But I don't have any news to make on Treasury's behalf, at least not today.\nByron.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. New York voters head to the polls today. You've said in the past the debate happening within the Democratic Party, about the direction and the future of the party is a healthy one, but it's now April 19th; Senator Sanders trails pretty badly in the delegate count, and you've seen the tone of the last debate and some of the rhetoric on the campaign trail get heated. Does the President still feel that this is a constructive campaign and conversation that's happening?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Byron, there's no denying that when you compare the campaign that's been waged by the Democratic candidates, that it has been much healthier and more productive than the campaign that we've seen be waged by the other side. And the President has obviously been pleased to see Democratic candidates who are giving voice and prioritizing the kinds of values that he's spent his career fighting for. That's been a good thing, and the President has obviously been pleased by that.\nBut, ultimately, the individual candidates are going to have to decide for themselves how this campaign will play out here in the remaining weeks of the Democratic contest. In 2008 -- I've talked about this a couple of times -- in 2008, there was a vigorous contest between then-Senator Clinton and then-Senator Obama that dragged on longer than people expected -- I think longer than anybody expected. But with some departures, it was primarily focused on policy and articulating a vision for the country. And that longer-than-expected Democratic primary had positive benefits for the party as a whole, and it certainly improved the performance of the Democratic nominee in the general election, and it certainly resulted in a Democratic campaign organization being stronger in states that Democrats had not recently competed in.\nI often cite the example of Indiana, a state that had a primary in May, that had rarely not been -- that had rarely been contested by Democratic presidential candidates. But there was a vigorous contest in May of 2008 between then-Senator Clinton and then-Senator Obama in Indiana. And there were some who concluded that that would be a bad thing for the Democratic Party.\nInstead, what resulted was a Democratic Party infrastructure being built in Indiana to support both candidates, each individual candidate, that then went on to greatly contribute to the Democratic candidate's success in the general election. And that led to President Obama winning the state of Indiana in the general election in 2008, something a Democratic presidential candidate hadn't done in decades.\nSo that's just one illustration of how a longer-than-expected primary contest can yield some positive results for the party and for the party's nominee. Is that going to happen this time around? I think it's too early to tell. Hopefully it will. But we'll see.\nQ: We've asked you sort of piecemeal about whether the President has watched individual debates or election night returns. But broadly speaking, how closely is the President following campaign news and the campaign trail? Is he watching sort of live election returns some nights? Is he reading about this online and in the newspaper? How does he sort of follow the campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's fair to say the President is following the election pretty closely. He obviously has a stake in who will succeed him in office. I do not believe that the President has spent much if any time watching live election returns. I know that he has not spent much time watching the debates. But he certainly is following the course of the broader debate that's taking place on both sides, frankly. And at some point, the President will have an opportunity to be a much more active participant in that debate. But that will be when we shift to the general election.\nQ: Does he miss it?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think that -- I don't think he does. Gardiner, I'm going to give you the last one and then I'm going to get ready for my overnight flight here.\nQ: Okay. Do you have any sense about if the Saudis follow through on their threat to sell $750 billion in U.S. assets, what kind of damage that would do to the U.S. economy and to the United States generally?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Gardiner, at the New York Times, you certainly have access to more sophisticated analysts of global financial markets than me, thank goodness. That is welcome news to the readers of your business pages, I'm sure.\nWhat I'll just say in general is our concern is that a hypothetical transaction or series of transactions like this would destabilize the global financial markets. And that kind of instability and that kind of volatility is not in the interest of any of the advanced economies around the world. Both the United States and Saudi Arabia would be in the category of advanced economies that would not benefit from a situation like that.\nThat's the observation that I have made. I know that the suggestion was raised in a story in your newspaper that that could be a potential response, and I don't know -- as I recall, that wasn't an on-the-record statement from a Saudi official. So I think it's hard to assess exactly how seriously something like that is being considered there.\nGiven our shared interest in protecting the stability of the global financial system, I suspect it's not something that would be considered for long.\nQ: I think there's increasing concern on the Saudi side that Washington has become far less hospitable a place for them sort of from a policy and also from a diplomatic perspective. They see the Obama administration has far less warm to them as the previous administration had been. They see this legislation on Capitol Hill as arising from what they worry is a sort of a growing anti-Saudi sentiment. Do they have reason to feel worried about this? This is President Obama's third trip to Saudi Arabia, this week, but the Saudis themselves and even some GCC members generally feel that they have seen their place in Washington decline substantially over the last several years. Is that -- are those worries justified?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I would encourage people who harbor that concern to do is to take a close look at President Obama's record. Just last year, the President convened the first-ever GCC-U.S. Summit at Camp David. That is a location that many world leaders are not invited to enjoy, but it is an indication of how important the President considers the relationship between the United States and our partners in that region of the world. The fact that he is following through with a second summit less than a year later I think is an indication that he's committed to following through on the discussions that were convened at Camp David last year.\nThe President has talked about the impact of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Part of the case that we made to our partners in the region who were initially skeptical of the wisdom of this diplomatic approach is that it would yield important national security benefits for them. And that's proved to be true.\nThe national security position of Saudi Arabia is strengthened if they know that one of their chief rivals in the region is verifiably not in pursuit of a nuclear weapon. That's a good thing for Saudi Arabia. That enhances their security. And that advancement would not have been possible without the United States leading the diplomatic effort to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nLet me give you another example. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been justifiably concerned about the security situation in Yemen. They share a long border with Yemen. The United States has offered them the kind of logistical support that has been critical to their ability to apply military pressure to rebels and extremists in Yemen. The United States and Saudi Arabia have worked together to apply pressure to al Qaeda plotters in Yemen. These are dangerous extremists that have designs not just on carrying out attacks against shared U.S.-Saudi interests in the region, they have designs on carrying out attacks against U.S. interests around the world. We're mindful of that threat, and we have worked effectively with the Saudis to counter it.\nWe have also worked effectively with Saudi Arabia and other GCC partners to add important resources to our counter-ISIL campaign. That includes not just important military contributions both in the form of military actions, but also in the form of military assistance to fighting forces on the ground, we've also obtained important Saudi assistance in countering ISIL's efforts to radicalize people online.\nWe have worked closely with the Saudis and the Emiratis and other GCC partners to shut down ISIL's efforts to finance their operations. We're talking -- some of the countries that the President will be meeting with have capitals who are a regional financial center, and by blocking or at least countering ISIL's ability to access the services available in those capitals is important to our longer-term success. And we have made progress in that effort because of their cooperation with the United States and because of their support for our coalition.\nSo there are a variety of ways in which the partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia has been enhanced under President Obama's leadership in a way that is good for the United States, that is good for our national security, and that's good for our homeland security. And that's always what the President is focused on when he's making these kinds of decisions and when he's engaged in this kind of diplomacy. And this is a good example of the President focused on the right goal in pursuit of the kind of common ground that benefits the citizens of both the United States and Saudi Arabia.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you next week.\nEND 2:27 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-04-19", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Bernie Sanders' campaign today announced that he has earned the endorsement of United Steelworkers Local 1999, whose members stand to lose 1,400 jobs with Carrier Corporation's decision to ship jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico.\n\"Bernie Sanders for decades has fought against the kinds of disastrous trade deals that are now allowing Carrier to ship over a thousand good-paying Indiana jobs to Mexico,\" said Local 1999 president Chuck Jones. \"Bernie Sanders is the only candidate running for president who will do something to stop this kind of corporate greed if he is elected – because he's been fighting against it for years. We will be doing everything we can to help him win the primary here in Indiana on May 3.\"\nSanders previously denounced the decision by Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, to move operations to Mexico.\n\"The decision by United Technologies to ship 2,100 jobs from Indiana to Mexico is the latest example of how NAFTA and other trade policies have been a disaster for American workers,\" said Sanders. \"In my view, we have got to fundamentally rewrite our failed trade policies so that American jobs are no longer our number one export. I was proud to help lead the effort against NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. Unfortunately, Secretary Clinton supported these trade policies which have led to the loss of millions of jobs and thousands of factories.\"\nIn the last week, Sanders has also earned the endorsement of Indianapolis City-County Councillors Zach Adamson and Jared Evans.

Bernie Sanders on Tuesday brought his White House campaign and the fight for working families to this city hard hit by the loss of decent-paying manufacturing jobs.\nThis year alone, General Electric has laid off almost 1,400 workers at a plant here. The jobs were shifted to Texas where anti-worker labor laws let the company slash wages in half. The Pennsylvania Department of Labor says the ripple effect of the GE layoffs will affect as many as 18,000 jobs in the region.\nBefore speaking to 2,197 supporters at the Bayfront Convention Center, Sanders met with members of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers Local 506, which represents workers at the GE plant.\nSanders has singled out GE as an example of \"corporate greed\" for taking advantage of job-killing trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. Over the last decade, GE has shut down 10 plants in the U.S., while it opened 58 factories in low-wage countries overseas. Sanders has led the fight in Congress against NAFTA and other trade deals which Hillary Clinton supported.\nSanders also has exposed GE as one of the major multi-national corporations which have exploited legal loopholes to avoid paying U.S. income taxes. He has introduced legislation that would repeal tax laws that cost the U.S. treasury $100 billion a year in lost revenue. From 2008 through 2013. GE, Verizon and Boeing posted profits totaling more than $102 billion but received income tax rebates from the Internal Revenue Service totaling more than $4.1 billion, according to a report from Citizens for Tax Justice.\nSanders traveled to Pennsylvania from New York, where 247 pledged delegates to this summer's Democratic National Convention were at stake in a primary election underway on Tuesday.

That's the latest in a string of Obamacare failures that have led to American families losing their doctors, having few or no insurance options, and facing skyrocketing premiums and deductibles.\n\"Sadly, none of this comes as a surprise.

God bless New York and God bless the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nI am so excited to share with you what America has learned over the past few months.\nAnd it has nothing to do with a politician tonight winning his home state.\nIt has everything to do with what we've seen in the towns and faces that have been weathered with trouble, joblessness, and fear. It is what we learned looking at the factories that have been shuttered and the hearts that are closing.\nWe have learned that America is at a point of choosing.\nThe media will say it is about choosing a president.\nBut it really isn't.\nOur real choice is personal, and every generation must make the same choice.\nWill we continue to live in the past with what we know no longer works, or will we move forward to a new and better place?\nThe people in state after state have made it clear.  They cry out for a new path.\nThis is the year of the outsider.\nI am an outsider, Bernie Sanders is an outsider.\nBoth with the same diagnosis, but both with very different paths to healing.\nMillions of Americans have chosen one of these outsiders. Our campaigns don't find our fuel in bundlers and special interests, but rather directly from the people.  The wide-eyed youth of any age that haven't given up on the hope that tomorrow can and will be better.\nRonald Reagan and Jack Kennedy were outsiders.\nThey both represented a whole new vision and vibrancy.\nA new generation of ideas.\nJack Kennedy looked forward instead of back to the first half century of world war.\nHe knew that America could dream and build if we were set free.\nNot tanks for war, but rockets for exploration.\nReagan looked out — to us - the most powerful force for innovation that the world has ever known:\nThere we found the new tech pioneers like Bill Gates and a young Steve Jobs.  They had vision and the freedom to build a new world that that at the time only THEY saw and because they were free. They challenged the way and changed the way all of us live, work, and interact.\nNow it is our turn.\nThis generation must first look inward to see who we really are, after years of being beaten down.\nYears of being told we couldn't, shouldn't, or wouldn't.\nThis generation needs to answer a new set of questions.\nCan we? Should we? Will we?\nAre we still those people?\nThose dreamers and doers?\nAre America's greatest generations in our past?\nOr are our best days yet ahead?\nWe must unite the Republican Party because doing so is the first step toward uniting all Americans.\nThe question is not whether all Americans can or will agree on a majority of issues all of the time.  The question is whether a majority of Americans are hungry to rally around a set of principles larger than any single issue that a politician may use to divide us.\nTonight, I'm speaking to you from Philadelphia.  It's natural, when we talk about our Nation's earliest days, that we focus our attention on the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  And we can learn a great deal about a path forward by focusing on the passionate disputes and disagreements among our founding fathers — differences that were put aside only because of the weight and consequence of the foundational principles they sought to proclaim and the price to be paid if they failed to rise to the task.\nToday, as Republicans, we agree on a lot.  And sure, areas of lesser agreement exist as well.  But on the fundamental question: are we satisfied with the current direction of our country; we speak with one voice.\nI call on you, as JFK did in the 60's.\nAnd as Reagan did in the 80's.\nTo chart a new American journey forward.\nOne that isn't led by me or anyone in Washington, but by you.\nAnd millions of others just like you.\nOne where we still have differences, yet we choose to concentrate on what we have in common.\nOne that lifts others up and believes in the rights, responsibilities, goodness, and strength of all mankind.\nWe have so much that binds us together: our families, our work ethic, our ability to dream and build unlike any people in history. But most of all our charity, our love for our fellow men and women and our willingness to sacrifice for those in need.\nLet us unite…on the things that have always made us great.\nWe are great because we are good.\nBecause over and over again we have chosen courage in the moments of crisis; freedom in the face of compromise; and hope in the face of challenges that everyone told us could not be overcome.\nOur sitting president ran on a slogan that should have been a great first step…\nIt promised us, \"yes we can.\"\nNow is the time to take that slogan and put it into action.\n\"Yes we can\" was a recognition of the hope that we can and should recover. The problem was that Barack Obama's prescriptions only led to more elitist control from Washington.  Less freedom for the People.\nBut now is the time, as Americans, to once again reclaim that hope.\nTo take another giant leap for mankind.\nTo speak the words with all the power and might that we can muster and use the words that have changed the world time and again:\nThe words that the slaves yearned to hear from the American people and Abraham Lincoln when they cried out for freedom.\nThe words, that Europe and Britain heard when they cried out for help defeating totalitarian evil in the 1940's.\nThe words that led two men in North Carolina to be the first in flight.\nAnd half a century later the first man to reach the moon.\nAnd decades later, two men in their garage to come up with Apple.\nThey are the words that will repair our tattered spirit, lift up our economy and those who are barely making it, they are the words that will vanquish the evil of ISIS. and return the rule of law.\nThey are the words that when Americans come together and say with conviction — they change the world.\nThey are the vision of this campaign:\nNot yes we can, but now: Yes we will.\nWe will restore our spirit;\nWe will free our minds and imagination;\nWe will create a new and better world;\nWe will bring back jobs, freedom, and security;\nWe will find new ways to ignite an energy revolution with more jobs and greater choices;\nWe will defeat the evil of Islamists and ISIS;\nWe will live as neighbors, friends, and family in peace once again;\nWe will heal the sick, feed the poor, and defend the defenseless;\nWe will restore our rightful place in the world.\nWe will do what Americans do best.\nWe will live for others - we will change the world through the hope of freedom's enduring promise. And our unrelenting spirit.\nYou can be empowered, and in a digital age it is all the easier for your voice to be heard.  Your choices to govern your work, your education, your future.  If only Washington will get out of the way.\nJoin me on this journey of less talk and more action because I know you. You may have been knocked down, but America has always been best when she is lying down with her back on the mat and the crowd has given the final count.  It is time for us to get up, shake it off and be who we were destined to be.\nDon't let anyone try to convince you otherwise.\nHere is the truth:  You don't need me or any politician.\nBut we do need each other, all of us, coming together as one, as We the People, because not only do we say — yes WE can, beginning here and now we pledge to each and every one of us, yes we will.\nAnd now my friends, onward to victory.", "timestamp": "2016-04-19", "title": "Remarks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: \"America Is at a Point of Choosing\""}

To address this threat, and in view of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 2174 of August 27, 2014, and 2213 of March 27, 2015, I hereby order:\nSection 1. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:\n(i) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, directly or indirectly, any of the following:\n(A) actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Libya, including through the supply of arms or related materiel;\n(B) actions or policies that obstruct, undermine, delay, or impede, or pose a significant risk of obstructing, undermining, delaying, or impeding, the adoption of or political transition to a Government of National Accord or a successor government;\n(C) actions that may lead to or result in the misappropriation of state assets of Libya; or\n(D) threatening or coercing Libyan state financial institutions or the Libyan National Oil Company;\n(ii) to be planning, directing, or committing, or to have planned, directed, or committed, attacks against any Libyan state facility or installation (including oil facilities), against any air, land, or sea port in Libya, or against any foreign mission in Libya; (iii) to be involved in, or to have been involved in, the targeting of civilians through the commission of acts of violence, abduction, forced displacement, or attacks on schools, hospitals, religious sites, or locations where civilians are seeking refuge, or through conduct that would constitute a serious abuse or violation of human rights or a violation of international humanitarian law;\n(iv) to be involved in, or to have been involved in, the illicit exploitation of crude oil or any other natural resources in Libya, including the illicit production, refining, brokering, sale, purchase, or export of Libyan oil;\n(v) to be a leader of an entity that has, or whose members have, engaged in any activity described in subsections (a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii), or (a)(iv) of this section;\n(vi) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, logistical, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of (A) any of the activities described in subsections (a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii), or (a)(iv) of this section or (B) any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or\n(vii) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.\n(b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order. The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section are in addition to export control authorities implemented by the Department of Commerce.\nSec. 2. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). Further, United Nations Security Council Resolution 2174 shall be treated as a Resolution listed in Annex A of Proclamation 8693.\nSec. 3. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566 and expanded in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.\nSec. 4. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not limited to:\n(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and\n(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\nSec. 5.

For the purposes of this order:\n(a) the term \"person\" means an individual or entity;\n(b) the term \"entity\" means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and\n(c) the term \"United States person\" means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\n(d) the term \"Government of National Accord or a successor government\" means:\n(i) a Government of National Accord formed pursuant to the terms of the Libyan Political Agreement signed in Skhirat, Morocco, on December 17, 2015, or any amendments thereto;\n(ii) a governmental authority formed under the Libyan Constitution pursuant to the terms of the Libyan Political Agreement signed in Skhirat, Morocco, on December 17, 2015, or any amendments thereto;\n(iii) any subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the foregoing, and any partnership, association, corporation, or other organization owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by, or acting for or on behalf of, the foregoing; or\n(iv) any other person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be included within paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.\nSec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566 and expanded in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.\nSec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and the UNPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.\nSec. 9.

All agencies of the United States Government are directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of the order.\nI am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nApril 19, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-04-19", "title": "Message to the Congress on Blocking Property and Suspending Entry Into the United States of Persons Contributing to the Situation in Libya"}

Recent public polling shows Trump leading statewide, but Gov. Kasich is sitting in a strong second place, far ahead of Ted Cruz.\nOur data show that Trump could lose to Kasich in almost any district but MD-1. He is particularly vulnerable in MD-4 and MD-8 as well as MD-2, MD-3, MD-5, MD-6 and MD-7.\nA serious effort in Maryland could cut the number of delegates Trump can win by almost half.\nConnecticut\nConnecticut is winner-take-all by congressional district and proportional over 20% statewide if no candidate reaches 50%. Current public polling has Trump at 49% statewide with John Kasich showing a strong second place. Internal data show Kasich can top Trump in CT-1, CT-2, CT-4 and CT-5.\nKeeping Trump under 50% statewide is critical. A serious #NeverTrump effort in Connecticut could cost Trump close to half the delegates here too.\nRhode Island\nRhode Island is proportional with a 10% threshold both statewide and by congressional district. Keeping Trump's margins down could cost him at least half a dozen delegates.\nDelaware\nDelaware will award all 16 of its delegates if a candidate receives a plurality of the vote. We expect Trump to have a strong chance of finishing above 50% and would recommend spending resources on the other April 26th states.\nPennsylvania\nSeventeen of Pennsylvania's delegates are bound to the winner, who we expect to again be Donald Trump. The remaining 54 are unbound but assigned by congressional districts. We expect to be competitive, but more importantly, we're focused on supporting delegate candidates who will work at the convention to nominate the most electable candidate in the fall.\nBottom-line: Donald Trump's win in New York got him closer to 1,237 delegates and if the #StopTrump movement is serious about stopping him, they should follow this roadmap leading up to the Tuesday, April 26th primaries.", "timestamp": "2016-04-20", "title": "Press Release - MEMO: The #NeverTrump Strategy for MD, CT, RI, DE and PA"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117360", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(Senate)\n(Sen. Cochran, R-MS)\nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides views on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 2028, containing the text of S. 2804, making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.\nThe Administration welcomes the bill's investments in improving resilience against current and ongoing climate impacts that threaten our economy, public health, and natural resources, as well as the Committee's stated support for the premise and goals of Mission Innovation. Additionally, the Administration appreciates the Committee's work to support investments in critical nonproliferation efforts and in maintaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal. However, the bill underfunds critical energy research and development activities and fails to put us on an achievable path toward doubling clean energy research and development by FY 2021. Specifically, the Administration objects to the low funding levels provided for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Reductions in both of these programs significantly below the FY 2017 Budget request would undermine critical activities that support the development and commercialization of clean energy technologies. At this funding level, the number of research, development, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs would be reduced, limiting innovation and technological advancement. Funding at this level also would impede development of solutions to reduce U.S. dependence on oil and reduce energy waste, and undermine the Nation's competitiveness in the future global clean energy economy.\nThe Administration supports the bill's investments in restoring the Nation's aquatic ecosystems, improving commercial navigation, and helping local communities reduce the risk of floods. However, the Administration believes funding included in the bill for the Army Corps of Engineers beyond the FY 2017 Budget request would not provide a high return on investment to the American taxpayer.\nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017. By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities. However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation. If the final bill that is presented to the President includes such provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.\nDepartment of Energy (DOE)\nMission Innovation. The Administration appreciates the Committee's stated support for the premise and goals of Mission Innovation and the support expressed for the related regional consortia. However, the bill underfunds critical energy research and development activities and fails to put us on an achievable path toward doubling clean energy research and development by FY 2021. The bill underfunds investment in our students, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs; our businesses and universities; and our future economy. This would slow the pace of progress on breakthroughs in energy efficiency and clean energy; undermine America's long-standing, nonpartisan support for pioneering research that seeks solutions to pressing problems; and hinder our ability to harness the power of new ideas and innovation to drive sustained economic growth in the clean energy economy of the future.\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). The Administration objects to the $293 million provided in the bill for ARPA-E, a reduction of $57 million or 16 percent from the discretionary request for ARPA-E in FY 2017 Budget request. This reduction would hinder the ability to invest in transformational technologies that reduce energy-related emissions, increase energy efficiency across multiple economic sectors, and reduce energy imports.\nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). The Administration strongly objects to the $2.1 billion provided in the bill for the EERE. Overall, this level is $825 million below the FY 2017 Budget request. Relative to the FY 2017 Budget request, the bill reduces funding for renewable energy by 26 percent, sustainable transportation by 27 percent, and energy efficiency by 20 percent. These reductions would significantly underfund critical activities that support the development and commercialization of clean energy technologies including wind energy, electric and other advanced vehicles, and building technologies. At this funding level, the number of research, development, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs would be reduced, limiting innovation and technological advancement. Funding at this level also would curtail solutions to reduce U.S. dependence on oil and reduce energy waste, and undermine the Nation's competitiveness in the future global clean energy economy. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request of $2.9 billion.\nElectricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.The Administration objects to the $206 million provided in the bill for Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability. The FY 2017 Budget requested funding levels for research and development (R&D) that provide for a balanced R&D portfolio. This includes funding for important energy storage and transformer resilience and advanced components activities as well as materials activities via the proposed Grid Manufacturing Institute. Both the State Distribution-Level Reform and State Energy Assurance programs respond to important Quadrennial Energy Review recommendations and the Administration encourages the Congress to fund these programs.\nOffice of Science. While the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Office of Science, the level of funding provided, which is $172 million below the discretionary total of the FY 2017 Budget request, would significantly impact basic R&D programs.\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The Administration opposes the $200 million level provided for SPR. At the bill level, important investments in SPR maintenance activities would be deferred potentially adversely impacting operational readiness.\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA). The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request of $131 million for EIA to fully fund investments in adding regional detail to petroleum data, enhancing commercial building energy efficiency data and expanding international analysis.\nNuclear Waste. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for implementing a workable solution for the management and disposal of the Nation's nuclear waste.\nDepartmental Administration. The Administration appreciates language in the bill which provides flexibility to the Department in the management and funding of its support functions within this account. However, a 10-percent reduction from the FY 2017 Budget request may significantly hinder DOE's ability to effectively implement priority management objectives such as project management and cost estimating, which ultimately drive greater efficiency within the agency.\nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). The Administration appreciates the Committee's strong support for NNSA's Weapons Activities, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Naval Reactors programs.\nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act). While the Administration appreciates the funding provided in the bill for DOE to implement the DATA Act, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to implement the DATA Act. This funding would support efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and employing a uniform procurement instrument identifier.\nU.S. Digital Service Team. The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop a U.S. Digital Service team. This funding would support efforts to manage digital services that have the greatest impact to citizens and businesses.\nCorps of Engineers – Civil Works (Corps)\nOverall Funding. The bill funds the Corps civil works program at a net level of $6 billion. The Administration believes the more appropriate overall funding levels proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request which would limit spending on projects that provide a low return to the Nation.\nEcosystem Restoration. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for ecosystem restoration activities, such as Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Restoration, Columbia River, South Florida Ecosystem Restoration, and Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Recovery, at the levels provided in the FY 2017 Budget request.\nTechnical Assistance. The Administration also appreciates the Committee's support for funding ongoing efforts that provide local communities with technical and planning assistance to enable them to reduce their flood risk, including nonstructural approaches.\nFill Material under the Clean Water Act.The Administration believes that it is essential to retain Federal agencies' discretion to pursue rulemakings they deem necessary to protect America's clean water resources, which are critical to American families and businesses. The Administration objects to section 103 of the bill, which could hamstring future regulatory work in this area, putting our water resources at risk.\nDepartment of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project\nOverall Funding. The bill provides $1.2 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and $10 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Act. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for priorities within the Bureau of Reclamation's program, as reflected in the FY 2017 Budget request, including the San Joaquin River Restoration Program, Indian Water Rights settlements, and the WaterSMART program.\nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.", "timestamp": "2016-04-20", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: Senate Amendment to H.R. 2028 - Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017"}

But it's not going to be perfect, so I'll try to get to as many people as I can.\nBut we have a first questioner already selected. You want to stand up tell us your -- tell everybody your name. Because I know you, but I want to make sure that everybody else knows who you are too. We just got to meet backstage. So introduce yourself, sweetheart.\nCHILD: Okay. Hello. My name is Keniya Brown. And my question for you would be, how do you plan to keep the Let's Move! program and any other health organisms [organizations] that you've already made during the White House -- how do you plan to keep those up?\nMRS. OBAMA: That's an excellent question. You may be seated, my dear. We're starting to think about that now. We're trying to figure out what organizations we can continue to work with when we leave the White House, how best to use the new platform as a former First Lady. The President is thinking about the same thing.\nBut the short answer to the question is, we're going to keep doing that work and we're going to figure out what are the best ways we can impact these issues. And we hope that a lot of the stuff that we've done here, particularly the White House Kitchen Garden that you guys got to see, that that will continue to be a fixture of the White House so that that won't go away, so that that's something that other Presidents and First Spouses and families continue to enjoy and continue to share with the rest of the community and the rest of the country. Because it's really sparked a conversation about community gardening, and there are more gardens in schools, and kids are eating what's grown in the garden. It's really starting to change the conversation.\nSo we'll have a better sense of exactly how we'll do it when we leave. But we're going to be working on that. One of the things an ex-President has to do is start a presidential library. I don't know if any of you have ever visited any of the existing presidential libraries -- have you? Is that what your little hand is for? I'll get to you in a second. But that's where -- it's sort of like a museum. It's part of the Smithsonian. But it's also a place where people can learn about what the President has done, how his legacy has impacted the nation. And usually it takes a few years before that library is planned and open.\nSo we're going to be working on that. That's a pretty big project. All right? Thanks for being here.\nAll right, let's start over on this side and I'll work each section, okay? Let's start in the back. I see a young lady way in the back. Yes, you, you! You, young lady. Yes. They're going to bring you the mic. Speak up. Tell me your name, your age, and if you know where your parent works -- but if you don't, don't worry about it.\nCHILD: My name is Addison (ph.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Speak up just a little more.\nCHILD: My name is Addison. I'm 9 years old. I don't know where my dad works. And my question is, what's it like to live in the White House?\nMRS. OBAMA: It's very special. But in many ways, living in the White House is -- at least the part of the house that is our home -- like, this floor is sort of the ceremonial floor, right? This is where all the state dinners happen, and all the important stuff. This isn't where we live every day. We live upstairs, right? And when you get upstairs, it still feels like home. We tried to make sure that our home here at the White House still felt like a regular home. Because, you remember, when we first got here, Malia and Sasha, our daughters, were little. They were in fifth grade and second grade. So it was important to make sure their rooms felt like little-kid rooms, and not like they were living in a museum. We made sure that how we eat dinner and what we do every day feels just like being at home.\nBecause you can imagine, if you were that age, moving into the White House, you wouldn't want to live in a museum, right? I mean, it would be cool a couple of times, right, maybe -- and sometimes when they were little they'd sneak down here, they'd play hide-and-seek. But the older they got the less excited they were about living in a museum, and they just wanted to live in a regular home where they can have their friends and have sleep-overs.\nSo, in many ways, it's like living in a museum, part of the house that we share with the world. And we've got visitors here -- thousands of people visit the White House every day, and they're walking through. We've got staff that are walking through sort of the public part of the White House. But then we get on the elevator and go upstairs and it's just a big home. Okay? Does that answer your question? But it's been fun. It's been a lot of fun.\nAll right, we've got this section. Okay, we're going to go with the young gentleman in the blue with the Polo -- yes, you. What's your name?\nCHILD: My name is Eamon. And my question for you is, how does it feel being on TV the whole time?\nMRS. OBAMA: The whole time. (Laughter.) Sometimes it's really, really weird. I don't even like to watch myself on TV. So I usually don't watch the things I do. Like I'll tape something -- because a lot of times when you're on TV, you tape it maybe weeks, sometimes months in advance, and then it comes on later. Just like all this stuff that you guys see me on iCarly and Doc McStuffins, and what else have I done -- guys remind -- Jessie -- that's right, Jessie. I can't forget Jessie. Pitch Perfect -- did I do Pitch Perfect? Okay, see, I'm getting old, I'm forgetting that stuff.\nBut when we do that, like Jessie -- I taped Jessie like almost three or four years ago. Can you believe that? It's been that long. And then they rerun it. So we tape it and go to the set and I do what I'm supposed to do, and then it airs. And a lot of times I don't even watch it because it's kind of uncomfortable for me to watch myself on TV.\nCan you guys understand that? Like I don't want to look and see -- it's, oh, I don't like the way I looked. Oh, I sounded funny. So I just kind of ignore it.\nCHILD: I love it.\nMRS. OBAMA: You love it? You love being -- I love Jessie, too. We love Jessie, right?\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\nMRS. OBAMA: I mean, the cast is cool. You know the thing I like most about Jessie, is all the cast members in real life, they're real people, they're really nice people and they're smart and they work really hard. Can you imagine being that young and working every day on a TV set, and need to know your lines and do things again and again and again?\nCHILD: (Inaudible.)\nMRS. OBAMA: You got to learn some poetry? Poetry is hard. Yes.\nSo it's fun to do, but I don't like to watch it.\nAll right, let's go over here. We're going to do a girl. In that pink coat. Yes, you. What's your name?\nCHILD: My name is Anayah (ph). I was wondering, you like to run, right?\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes. I'm a little scared of this question. (Laughter.)\nCHILD: There's a race here -- it's called Girls on the Run --\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes, I know Girls on the Run.\nCHILD: I was wondering if you could come support us on our 5K run.\nMRS. OBAMA: When is your 5K run?\nCHILD: May 14th.\nMRS. OBAMA: May 14th. You know what, this is one of these important-people responses. I have to check my schedule, because there is stuff they put on my schedule way ahead. But I know Girls on the Run. We work closely with Girls on the Run for our Let's Move! work. So you're doing a 5K? Did you train for your 5K?\nCHILD: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: Are you ready to do this?\nCHILD: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay. Well, if I can't come, know that I am supporting you every step of the way, because I'm so proud that you have committed to getting good exercise every day. And running is, like, not that easy, right? Don't you get tired sometimes?\nCHILD: I do.\nMRS. OBAMA: How many people here, how many kids are runners? I love that. I love that. It is so important for you guys to get exercise on a regular basis. And it doesn't have to be running. It doesn't have to be a sport. Some kids are good at sports, but it can be dancing. It can be playing with your dog. It can be going for a walk with your parents. But it is so important for you guys, if you want to grow up to be big and strong and capable, to make sure that you start figuring out how to incorporate exercise in your life in some way, shape, or form. Okay?\nGood luck on your race, babe. I'll be thinking about you. Thank you for the invitation, though.\nAll right, we're coming over here. All right, young man in the checkered shirt in the third row. You, yes. You're looking around -- well, this kid in the third row. What's your name, babe?\nCHILD: Logan.\nMRS. OBAMA: Logan. Welcome.\nCHILD: What's your favorite thing to do with your dogs?\nMRS. OBAMA: Just squeeze them. (Laughter.) I let my dogs do a lot. They can sit on my lap, they sit on my chair, they cuddle with me. I like to lay on the floor with them and blow in their face. (Laughter.) I like to make them run and chase each other. But they're so cute, I just love to just cuddle them and massage them. I give them massages, I do. That's why they love me, because they know I'll give them a massage.\nBut I just love to love them, you know? I think you guys are going to get a chance to meet them too, hopefully, before you guys -- Bo and Sunny, the very dogs! We don't have any other dogs, just Bo and Sunny.\nAll right, let's come back over here. I'm going to do a girl in this section. Young cutie in the front. Yes, you, in the black and white.\nCHILD: Why do you like to exercise a lot?\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah. (Laughter.) Because it makes me feel young. (Laughter.) Because it makes me feel good. It gives me energy, you know? I mean, sometimes -- it doesn't make sense sometimes that when you're tired, that doing more work that makes you exert energy would make you feel better, but there's something about exercise that gets your heart pumping and the blood running that actually makes me feel better.\nAnd when I don't exercise a lot, I start feeling sluggish and more tired. And I don't know about you, but I want to live a long time, okay? I want to be -- I've said this before -- I want to be, like, a 90-year-old lady that's really fly, you know? (Laughter.) Do you guys have grandparents that are still pretty fly? They still dress -- you're like, no. (Laughter.) Well, I want to be one of those grandparents that's still, like, out in the park running with the grandkids and lifting them up, and maybe doing some runs and things like that. If I want to be that when I'm 90, then I've got to be exercising now when I'm 52, okay?\nSo that's why I like to exercise. And it's fun. I try to make it fun.\nOkay, we're coming over here. We're going to do a -- we're going to flip it, do a girl here so we can do a boy there so we're not doing each section the same. Okay. White sweater, hand up, so excited. What's your name?\nCHILD: My name is Rowan (ph.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Rowan. How are you? How old are you?\nCHILD: I'm 10.\nMRS. OBAMA: Ten.\nCHILD: And I have two really quick questions.\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay.\nCHILD: One is, what gave you -- what is your inspiration to do, like, Let's Move! and Joining Forces and all of those things that you do?\nMRS. OBAMA: All my initiatives? Well, they're kind of different. With Let's Move!, it's really -- I've seen a lot of kids who are not as healthy as they could be. And when my kids were little, my kids were -- when they were really little, the doctor warned me to make sure that we weren't giving our kids too much junk food and that they were getting enough exercise.\nSo I know that when my kids were little, that was something that I had to worry about. So I wanted to make sure that all parents, families were getting the kind of information they needed about how important it is for a child's overall well-being to make sure they're getting enough vegetables, not eating too much processed food, not going out to eat at fast-food places too much. Because it does affect how your brain works and what you're able to do in life.\nBecause some kids, we were starting to have an obesity epidemic in this country -- we still do. And when kids are morbidly obese at an early age, it makes them more susceptible to things like high blood pressure. They can have strokes and heart attacks when they're young. And I just sort of thought -- to imagine that these are all preventable things, right? That if parents just knew and got their kids moving, we'd eliminate that issue for kids.\nSo I was like, I'm going to make sure that more people know about it. So we started Let's Move!\nNow, with Joining Forces -- for those of you who don't know, Joining Forces is an initiative that Dr. Biden, Jill Biden, who is the Vice President's wife, and I started. Because Jill Biden had a son in the military, so she was what's called a Blue Star Mom. And I came to know the military community through campaigning and going on bases and getting to understand all the challenges that these families are facing.\nBecause most people don't know -- how many people here belong to a military family? So we've got a few military kids. And when your parent is a part of the military, a lot of times kids like you move a lot, right? And when you have to move every couple of years -- the average military kid might be at seven, eight, nine schools in their lives because they're moving with their parents. A lot of people don't know that, and how hard that can be on families, right?\nImagine if you had a parent who was deployed year after year -- that means they're off somewhere fighting in a war and you don't know how they're going to be -- that adds pressure to them. And a lot of Americans just didn't know that these families were out there. They knew about the soldiers that are fighting, right, but they don't know that back home there are all these amazing families serving right alongside them.\nSo Jill and I wanted to make sure that the whole country, we were always aware of these families and that we were doing everything we can to thank them and make sure we were supporting them. So those are the reasons I started those two initiatives.\nCHILD: Can I have a hug?\nMRS. OBAMA: You want a hug? All right, you know, we're going to do a little hugging afterwards, but if I start hugging, we'll never get out of here. We're just going to hug our way out. So I'll give a few little hugs before I go, okay? All right, sweetie. Thank you!\nAll right, we've got a boy over here, blue T-shirt right in the third row. What's your name, sir?\nCHILD: My name is Joshua.\nMRS. OBAMA: Stand up so we can see you, Joshua.\nCHILD: And I'm 13.\nMRS. OBAMA: Thirteen, ohh, that's a serious age. What's your question?\nCHILD: Where did you grow up?\nMRS. OBAMA: I grew up in Chicago, on the South Side of Chicago. What did you say? Is it what?\nCHILD: Illinois.\nMRS. OBAMA: Illinois, yes. Chicago is in Illinois. So that's where I grew up. I was born and raised there. I went to public school there. Went to grammar school and high school, and then I graduated and went to college, and left home. So Chicago is my home.\nAll right, let's go over here. We're going to go to the back. And we've got a young lady in a blue sweater and a white shirt. Yes, you! There you go. What's your name?\nCHILD: My name is Margo (ph.) And I'm 11.\nMRS. OBAMA: You had to think about that for a second?\nCHILD: No.\nMRS. OBAMA: Like, huh.\nCHILD: And my dad works at USTR, over there.\nMRS. OBAMA: Nice.\nCHILD: And my question was, what is the biggest thing that you're going to miss when you leave the White House?\nMRS. OBAMA: This. Yeah, I'm going to miss all the time I get to spend with kids like you guys. I could do this -- I could sit and talk to you guys all day, every day if they would let me. Because I really do believe that you guy are our future, and if there's anything that I can do to help kids in our country grow up healthier and smarter, with more opportunities, I think it's the best investment that we can make.\nI love you guys like I love my own kids. I don't nag you guys as much, but trust me, if you were around me longer I would. So I will miss this. I will miss the opportunities to have a big platform to make a lot of change.\nBut like I said in the first question, that we're going to figure out -- the President and I are going to figure out ways to keep doing the things that we love to do even when we're not here in the White House. All right?\nOkay, we're coming back over here. We've got a boy -- all right, you've got your hat on -- hat and glasses. Just because you've got that hat and glasses on, and I can't even pretend like I don't see you. What's your name?\nCHILD: My name is Dominic (ph.)\nMRS. OBAMA: How old are you?\nCHILD: Eleven.\nMRS. OBAMA: Welcome.\nCHILD: And what would you want the next President to do? Like, what would you suggest for the next President to keep doing?\nMRS. OBAMA: Doing that we're doing here?\nCHILD: Yeah.\nMRS. OBAMA: That's a good question. Well, one of the main things I hope that every presidential family and every administration does going forward, which I think this is an easy and important thing to do, is to continue focusing on our military families.\nBecause sometimes we forget, in a country when we're worried about how safe we are, and we're worried about making sure that our enemies are not going to threaten us, that there are families behind all of those cries for strong defense, right? There are families that sacrifice. And we can never forget those families.\nAnd in order to really support them, it's really helpful if the President and the Vice President and the First Spouse and the Second Spouse make this a top priority. And whether they call it Joining Forces or call it whatever, continuing to put a spotlight on our servicemembers, our military families, making sure they have jobs when they come home, that their kids have a good education, that that's always one of the top priorities of this country -- I think that's important.\nThat would be the only thing. Because really, it's up to the President and that family to have their own priorities. That's the prerogative. And I wouldn't ask somebody to necessarily do the things I thought they should do, because that's one of the things they get to do. When you're elected as President, you get to decide your agenda.\nBut I think that the whole country can always rally around our military and our families and our veterans in a really major, powerful way. I hope the next administration outdoes everything we do on Joining Forces, and I hope that the country holds the next administration accountable to making sure they do that -- do it even better than we're doing it. Because we don't mind being outdone on this initiative. We hope somebody knocks the ball out of the park -- and that we're a country that never forgets the sacrifices that people make to keep us safe. Does that make sense?\nAll right. We're coming over here. We're going to the back. Little one in the red right here. Yes, you. What's your name?\nCHILD: My name is Naomi (ph.) I am eight. My mom works at the New Executive Office Building.\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay.\nCHILD: My question is, how do you help people in your job?\nMRS. OBAMA: In my job?\nCHILD: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: You guys are asking some really good questions. My goodness. Gosh, that's a tough -- I hope I'm helping kids think about eating better. I mean, let me ask you guys -- do you guys think about what you eat differently, do you think? Do you guys believe that vegetables and fruit are important? Do you know that's important?\nCHILDREN: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: Tell me more about what you know. Because you'll tell me whether I'm helping you, whether you're hearing the messages. What do you think about kids' health?\nCHILD: (Inaudible.)\nMRS. OBAMA: I know that's hard.\nCHILD: I think maybe we should eat healthier, like there should be no dessert sometimes and eat our vegetables every once in a while, and fruits.\nMRS. OBAMA: So we have some balance, right?\nCHILD: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: But you can't eat junk food all the time. You can't have dessert all the time. You've got to have some vegetables and fruit in there some of the time, right? It's all about balance.\nWell, if I've helped kids in any way be more conscious of that kind of stuff -- I hope that I've helped some kids in that way. I hope I've helped some military families feel like they're getting the recognition and support they deserve.\nBut we'll see. I mean, it's hard for me to say whether what I've done has actually helped. I hope it has. We're starting to see some changing trends in childhood obesity that I won't go into with you. But that's one thing I hope -- I hope when I leave here, people look back on the things that I've done and they say, wow, Michelle Obama really helped her country. But we'll see. Okay?\nAll right, we're over here. Way in the back, young man in the blue. Yes. Stand up. Stand up. What's your name?\nCHILD: My name is Theo. I'm 13 years old. And my dad works in the New Executive Office Building. I was wondering, what do you personally think is the most important thing that you've done or initiative that you've started during this administration?\nMRS. OBAMA: Wow. You know, I think the work that we've done on childhood health has been really important because when I first came here and we started talking about childhood obesity, there are a lot of people who said that's not a problem. So we didn't even realize there was a problem in this country seven years ago. Now we know it's a problem.\nAnd the question is, what do we do to solve it? Can we make improvements in the school lunches that our kids are eating? And we've been able to do that. Are we doing more to get kids more active? Are we incorporating more big-name celebrities to endorse things that are healthy? Like Steph Curry. You know, Steph Curry isn't endorsing a soda, right? He's endorsing water. And that's huge, right? Because most -- a lot of celebrities, they'll endorse something that may not be that good for you, right? But somebody as big as Steph Curry is endorsing water. And water is good for everybody, right?\nSo I think that those are some of the changes that I think can really have an impact. And as I said earlier, I think that anything that helps you guys as kids grow up healthier is going to help our country twelvefold, right? Because if you grow up healthier, grow up more active, grow up with better opportunities to get an education and get a job, that makes our country stronger.\nSo I hope that even though I'm working with kids, that you guys, as you grow, will carry on those habits and those opportunities to your -- when you go to college, and eventually when you get married and have your kids, if you decide to do that, that those will be things that will be passed on generations after you guys.\nAll right, let's go over here. I'm going to come up front. Little Miss Boots. What's your name? Stand up and tell us who you are.\nCHILD: My name is Treasure (ph). My question is --\nMRS. OBAMA: How old are you, Treasure?\nCHILD: Seven.\nMRS. OBAMA: I like your boots.\nCHILD: Thank you.\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes. What's your question?\nCHILD: My question is, how many dogs do you have?\nMRS. OBAMA: I have two dogs. One is named Bo, who's a boy. He'll be eight years old in October. And Sunny is a girl, and she'll be three. And hopefully, you'll get to meet them. You like dogs? Do you have a pet? What do you have? She has a dog. What's your dog's name? D.C.? Nice. (Laughter.)\nAll right, I want to come over here. Okay, okay, okay. Red T-shirt. Oh, yes, right in the back. What's your name?\nCHILD: My name is Deamonte (ph). And I'm 14 years old. And my question for you is, what was your dream job before becoming First Lady?\nMRS. OBAMA: My dream job. I went to law school, so I'm a lawyer by training. And I thought being a lawyer was my dream job. And I got a big job at a big law firm and made a lot of money. But then I realized when I got to my dream job that I wasn't really happy, happy, because what I really liked to do, what I learned was that I like working with people and I like working in the community, and I like helping people develop skills to work in the community and help more people than just me, or just make money. That wasn't important to me. After I did it and I realized, yes, this is nice, but I want to do more.\nSo I got the chance to run a nonprofit organization that helped young people who were just out of college find out how to develop themselves for careers in the public service -- working in youth programs, and working in foundations that raise money to help kids do things. There are a whole range of nonprofit organizations that do good work. And I got to help young people gain entry into those careers.\nBecause a lot of times, you don't know about those careers, right? A lot of times, as you're growing up, people ask you, what do you want to be? And maybe you know about being a doctor or a lawyer, some of the major professions that we know about. But being the director of a youth program may not be something you even know you can do, right? But you can. You can get paid for working in your neighborhood with kids just like you. You can get paid to raise money for organizations that are helping kids go to college.\nSo that was one of the jobs I got to do. And I got to start a whole new organization on my own. I had to hire staff. I had to raise money. So that was a pretty fun job that got me out of the law and into more public service work, which is what I like to do. All right?\nOkay, we're coming over here. All right, we're going to do middle. We have a little pink with the white fluff around your neck. What's your name?\nCHILD: Saya (ph).\nMRS. OBAMA: Saya, how are you?\nCHILD: Good.\nMRS. OBAMA: What's your question?\nCHILD: My question is, what's your favorite part of your job?\nMRS. OBAMA: The favorite part of my job. Sometimes I like to travel when I'm not too tired. Sometimes travel is hard, but it's -- I've been able to see the world, right? I mean, on Friday, the President and I are going to have lunch with the Queen of England. Oh, I know! That's really going to be pretty cool. We're going to go to Windsor Castle and we're going to have lunch with the Queen. Pretty cool.\nSo we've gotten to do some fun things like that. I got to meet the Pope twice -- two Popes. So travel is a really fun part of being First Lady. But sometimes it gets tiring because you're, like, in another part of the world. You have to get up and you have to work even though you're jetlagged and you're away from your family, and all that good stuff. But it's been fun to be able to see a lot of parts of the world.\nAll right, we're coming over here. We're going to do a boy over here. There's a plaid shirt on the end -- yes. I know there are two plaid shirts. What's your name, babe?\nCHILD: My name is Ryan.\nMRS. OBAMA: Stand up for me, sweetie.\nCHILD: My name is Ryan. I'm 10 years old. What group do you support most?\nMRS. OBAMA: What kind of -- what do you mean by group?\nCHILD: Like what -- Girls on the Run --\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, what organization. You know what, as First Lady, I get to support a lot of different organizations. I don't have to pick just one. So we work with -- oh, we work with -- I wouldn't even begin to name the hundreds and hundreds of great organizations that we work with to get what we do done. Because the truth is -- I don't know if people know this about the First Lady, but unlike the President, I don't have a budget or a big staff to do all the things that I do. So I have to rely on a lot of other organizations who are doing the work that we think is important. And I help lift them up, right?\nSo they're doing the hard work. And there are tons of really great organizations that work with me on military family issues. We've got Blue Star families and great veterans' organizations, and an organization called Gold Star Families that supports families who've lost someone in the war. Let's Move, we work with all these great youth organizations, like Girls on the Run. From my Let Girls Learn effort, I've worked with the Peace Corps in order to get a lot of that stuff done.\nSo I could name -- I could go all afternoon naming names. There's no way I could do what I do without the support of a lot of great organizations. But that's a great question.\nAll right, we're coming over here. We're going to do a boy, because I'm going to switch it up so we get a girl. In the back, bow tie, because you've got a bow tie on. What's your name?\nCHILD: My name is Gabriel Papaul (ph.) My dad works at the Office of the Vice President, and I'm 12 years old.\nMRS. OBAMA: Good to have you here.\nCHILD: And my favorite -- my question is, what's your favorite food?\nMRS. OBAMA: Favorite what?\nCHILD: Your favorite food.\nMRS. OBAMA: Favorite food -- hands down, pizza. Pizza! (Laughter.) Don't you all agree?\nCHILDREN: Yes!\nMRS. OBAMA: Pizza is the ultimate food, because it can be a junk food, it can be healthy. Like, almost every Friday I'll eat, like, a veggie pizza on wheat. Now, that may not be something you like, but I like it. You can have dessert pizza. You can do anything with pizza. It's a very versatile, universally loved food. And I like French fries.\nAll right. Okay, we're coming over here, we're going to do a girl. All right, in the jeans jacket, way in the back with the headband. What's your name?\nCHILD: My name is Alyssa (ph.) I'm going to be 12 in six days.\nMRS. OBAMA: In six days? What are you going to do for that birthday, girl?\nCHILD: I'm going to Sky Zone.\nMRS. OBAMA: You're going where?\nCHILD: Sky Zone.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, is that like the trampoline place?\nCHILD: Yeah.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, nice. Well, yes, I know Sky Zone. I've got kids. Okay, what's your question?\nCHILD: My question for you is what are you going to do after your -- when you guys move out?\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, we're going to get our house ready. We've got to find a place to live because we can't live here. They're kicking us out! I've got to find a house to live. And you know what, the President and I, we might just take a vacation -- shh, don't tell anybody. We might just do nothing for a second.\nAnd then, if you remember, I said we've got a presidential library, and I'm going to keep doing all my initiatives. But right after we leave here, we might just, like, take a nap. (Laughter.)\nAll right, we're coming over here. We're going to do a boy. In the third row, yes, with the blue shirt, glasses -- oh, yes, you have a blue -- with the glasses on. Your name, sweetie.\nCHILD: My name is Cameron. And my question -- I'm eight -- and my question is, why did you choose President Barack Obama as your husband? (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh. That's a good question. Well, Cameron, sir, I chose him because he was smart. Because he cared a lot about other people; that he didn't have to make a lot of money to feel important. And he was kind, and he loved children. And he loved his family, so I figured if he loved his family he would love a family we created. And because he's cute. (Laughter.) All right?\nWe're moving here. All right, in the front. It's getting a little personal in here. (Laughter.) What's your name, sweetie?\nCHILD: My name is Keira (ph.) I'm 11 years old, and my dad works at the USTR.\nMRS. OBAMA: Nice.\nCHILD: My question was, what do you like to do with your family in your free time?\nMRS. OBAMA: You know, we do things like normal families. You know what, teenagers in the room, how many teenagers really care about spending time with their parents? See, mine don't. They're beyond hanging out with us. You still like hanging out with your parents? You're just in seventh grade -- do you? You don't. Well, that's good. Enjoy it, because it goes away.\nSo we try to eat dinner every night as a family. So almost every night we eat dinner together. So we get to catch up, and I love to catch up on the gossip in my girls' life -- whose friends are mad at who, and what boys are in the scene. And I love all that gossip stuff.\nBut generally, now that they're getting older, they want to hang out with their friends. They're trying to go to a party. They're trying to do sleepovers. So when you guys get older, you'll find that your friends are more important than your family. And everybody tells me that that changes -- that after college, they come back to you. I'll be waiting patiently for that to happen.\nSo we don't do anything special. We take family vacations together, and we do a lot of talking. We'll watch movies together -- nothing special. We're a pretty regular family. Nothing too exciting goes on upstairs, trust me.\nAll right, let's come over here. We've got a boy. We're going to do a boy -- young man in the blazer. Yes, you. Up here in this third row, right here in front. Yes, here he comes. Tell me your name.\nCHILD: My name is Jonathan Brezwill (ph.) I'm 14 years old. And my question to you is, do you think Hillary Clinton is -- has made major accomplishments as a female candidate? And would you like to run for President yourself?\nMRS. OBAMA: I think Hillary Clinton is a phenomenal woman. And I've gotten to know her, and I think she's made some pretty major contributions over the course of her life. She's devoted her life to public service, as have many people in -- who are seeking the presidency.\nBut Hillary Clinton is an impressive woman. I will not do what she has done -- I will not run for President. But there are other things that I want to do to stay involved in working in public service. Great question.\nAll right, we're going to -- what? Oh, Pany says this is the last question. Pany, stand up so that you can be the blame. (Laughter.) This is Pany. She looks sweet -- don't run, Pany. (Laughter.) Don't run.\nAll right, here's what we're going to do. I'm going to do one more quick question in every section, and then we'll end it. So it's got to be a quick question, all right?\nYoung lady behind you in the floral dress.\nCHILD: My name is Cammy (ph) and I'm 10. And I was wondering, if you had a choice would you rather have a private life or would you stay in this life forever?\nMRS. OBAMA: You know, once you've been in the public light, at least for me, having privacy becomes much more valued, right? I know a lot of kids your age, you think about being on social media and being a star. But as you get older, you start valuing what's called anonymity -- people now knowing who you are.\nLike, right now, I can't walk out my front door without people knowing who I am. And that sounds cool when you're maybe your age, or you're, like, Justin Bieber's age, or something like that. But when you're my age, having a little anonymity is a good thing.\nBut I also want to be able to continue to have impact. So I'm not going to get mad at the fact that people know who I am because that means I can help more people. So if I can keep helping more people, I don't mind being in the public arena. But a little more privacy would be good. Great question.\nAll right, last question in this section. Way in the back in the plaid shirt. The young man -- yes.\nCHILD: Do you like your job?\nMRS. OBAMA: I love my job. Great question.\nHere, we're coming over here. In the red top right there, little girl. What's your name, sweetie?\nCHILD: My name is Isis (ph.) And my mom works because -- for the President.\nMRS. OBAMA: Okay. What's your question?\nCHILD: Where are you going to work after you're done being the First Lady?\nMRS. OBAMA: I don't know! I'm going to work in my house. (Laughter.)\nAll right, we'll do one more here. We've got time for one quick one. Little one right here. I know! It's just not fair!\nCHILD: My name is Jill. And do Sunny and Bo know any tricks?\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes. Bo can sit, speak, roll over. They can both sit, and down. They can both heel. Bo is very good at giving you his paw, he can give you a high five. Yeah, he knows a few tricks. Sunny, if I spent more time with Sunny, she would know more because she's really smart. But I've been a little busy. So when I leave here I'm going to try to teach her some tricks too.\nAll right, last question! The last one! Young lady right here.\nCHILD: Who is going to perform at the Fourth of July?\nMRS. OBAMA: That's a good question. Deesha, who is going to perform at the Fourth of July? Do you have that figured out yet? Because it's coming.\nMS. DYER: We're working on it. We're working on it.\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, that means she doesn't want to say, because -- all right. We don't know yet, but hopefully it's somebody good.\nOkay, we can do one more, one more, one more! Orange shirt, right there. Last question, make it a good one!\nCHILD: If you had braces when you were little, what age did you have them at?\nMRS. OBAMA: I didn't have braces when I was little, and I wish I did.\nCHILD: What?\nMRS. OBAMA: I know! See, you guys, I wish I had had braces because my bottom teeth stick out a little bit. And if I had had braces, they would be fixed by now. So for all of you who don't like your braces, you will appreciate it when you're my age. And here's a piece of advice: Wear your retainer! (Laughter.) All right, parents, I'm helping you all out -- if you have braces, wear your retainers. This is around the time you'll start getting braces. Both my girls had braces right around middle school. They were seventh, eighth grade; eight, ninth. That's when they got braces.\nAll right, you guys, this has been -- I know, I wish I could stay longer. You guys are awesome. You asked great questions. We're going to do a little -- we're going to try to do some orderly hugging. But I can't hug everybody, but that means you've got to stay in your seat, and I'm going to come to you. You can't move from your seat, okay? But I'm not going to be able to get to everybody, all right?", "timestamp": "2016-04-20", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady in a Question & Answer Session With Children on Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day"}

EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. It's nice to see you all. Ben has a couple of readouts that we'll do at the top, and then we'll open it up to your questions. Obviously we can try to do a little readout of some of the meetings the President did yesterday and at least the beginning of the GCC Summit that the President is participating in as well. But Ben will do this at the top, and then we'll open it up to your questions on any topic.\nBen.\nMR. RHODES: Thanks. Let me just briefly give you a readout of some of the meetings the President had this morning. First of all, he was able to meet with Sheikh Al-Sabah of Kuwait -- their first meeting since last May at the Camp David summit. The President and Sheikh Al-Sabah continued a conversation that they began earlier this year through an exchange of letters that focused on how to strengthen our bilateral cooperation. To bolster that relationship, the leaders agreed to have foreign ministers inaugurate a strategic dialogue that will convene in Washington in the next few months. Currently, Kuwait, of course, continues to be one of our closest partners in this region – it hosts the fourth largest number of U.S. forces abroad.\nOn Iraq, Sheikh Al-Sabah agreed on the need for Gulf support to stabilize areas of Iraq that have been liberated from ISIL. The President and Sheikh Al-Sabah also exchanged thoughts on how to approach Iran's troubling behavior in the region, but also agreed on the importance of engaging Iran with the aim of moving it toward a different, improved relationship with the Gulf.\nSeparately, the President conveyed his deep appreciation of Sheikh Al-Sabah for being a leading voice in the GCC for humanitarian assistance for Syrian refugees. He welcomed Sheikh Al-Sabah's participation in the summit on refugees that the President will host in New York in September.\nSecond, the President was able to meet with His Highness, Sheikh Tamim of Qatar. The two leaders focused on what steps Qatar can take, along with the rest of the GCC, to help address the conflicts in Syria, Yemen, and Libya. On Syria, the President and Emir discussed the importance of reinforcing the cessation of hostilities. The Emir committed to use Qatar's influence with various opposition groups to support the path toward a political transition away from Assad.\nWith regard to Libya, the President conveyed his appreciation for Qatar's support to build Libyan support for the Government of National Accord. He and the Emir agreed on the importance of further consolidating international support behind the new Government of National Accord while also mitigating the actions of potential spoilers.\nFinally, the President also welcomed the Emir's update on expanded Qatari counterterrorism efforts, especially in the area of countering terrorist financing.\nAnd then this morning, in the first session at the GCC Summit, the leaders discussed regional conflicts. That gave them an opportunity to review the situations in Syria, in Yemen, in Iraq, and across the region broadly. They'll have a lunch this afternoon that is focused on countering ISIL and al Qaeda, and our counterterrorism cooperation. And then they'll have a session concluding the summit this afternoon that focuses on Iran and our shared efforts to confront its destabilizing activities in the region while promoting broader peace and stability.\nMR. EARNEST: Good. Let's start with questions.\nNadia, do you want to start?\nQ: First on Kuwait -- the negotiation about Yemen. After this first session, are we closer to see an end to the war in Yemen? Is it some commitment that you have from GCC countries that it's going to be over? And also, what would you describe the main sticking points that the President was unable to convince his GCC counterparts in his meeting?\nMR. RHODES: Well, first of all, on Yemen, I think this meeting takes place at a moment of particular promise and opportunity to resolve the conflict there. The cessation of hostilities has broadly held over the last several days. With that cessation of hostilities, there's an opportunity to pursue broader peace talks. Kuwait, of course, has offered to be a host for those discussions and we very much encourage the Houthis and other forces inside Yemen to participate constructively in that dialogue.\nSo we do believe that there's a pathway to resolving the conflict in Yemen that can restore stability after all of the efforts that have been exerted by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other forces inside of Yemen. And that, of course, will allow us also to focus on threats like AQAP in Yemen and extremist groups across the region.\nOn your second question, I think that there's broad agreement about where we're trying to go in the region. I think everybody would like to see ISIL defeated and pushed out of the territory that it controls. People would like to see stability restored to Yemen and a political transition in Syria away from Assad. And people would like to see Iraq, for instance, maintain its unity and increase its stability.\nSo I think on the core issues there's agreement about where we want to go. There have been I think occasional tactical differences about what we are emphasizing at a given point in time. But I think what this summit allows us to do is make sure that we're working to align our approaches and strategies. And if you look at where we were a year ago at Camp David and where we are now, we have seen progress in the implementation of the Iran deal, in the cessation of hostilities in both Syria and Yemen -- as fragile as they are, particularly in Syria, it at least provides an opening for a political process -- and of course, with ISIL losing a significant amount of its territory.\nSo even with some of the debates that have taken place, we've been able to broadly align our approaches and make progress, and we want to continue that here in Saudi Arabia.\nMR. EARNEST: Margaret.\nQ: Ben, Saudi and Gulf leaders feel like the Iranian regime really poses an existential threat to them. So do you think their fear is irrational? What do you say in these meetings? And do you understand their frustration that they're being asked to reach out to a country that is recognized as a state sponsor of terrorism and make nice with them?\nMR. RHODES: So we made very clear to the leaders last night and today on the subject of Iran that our partners, our friends in this region are in the room with us here, and Iran, on the other hand, has in many ways been confrontational not just to the countries here in the GCC, but to the United States as well, and that we share their concerns about Iran's ballistic missile program, its destabilizing activities in the region, its ongoing support for terrorism.\nAnd, in fact, many of the capabilities that we're developing on the defense side through this process are focused on countering Iranian actions. So when you talk about the ability to have enhanced missile defense systems, maritime interdictions, training of Special Forces -- all of these deal with the type of asymmetric threats that we see emanating from Iran in different parts of the region. And we've been able to have from the United States and several of our partners a number of interdictions, for instance, of Iranian weapon shipments at sea just in recent weeks.\nAt the same time, I think the point the President makes is that there has to be an opening to have a political resolution to these conflicts, that the perpetual nature of the violence that we see in Yemen, in Syria, in Iraq is not in the interest of anybody, and that in order to resolve these conflicts there has to be a diplomatic effort with the Iranians. So in Syria, to the extent to which we can bring the Iranians to the table in supporting a political process, that is going to make it more likely that a political process can succeed.\nIn Iraq, obviously Iran has a series of relationships in Iraq. They have a degree of influence in Iraq, but that should not cause us to disengage. On the contrary, that I think raises the interest of the United States and the Gulf partners to support the Iraqi government and to remain engaged inside of Iraq.\nSo in all these different places, we have a similar assessment of the fact that Iran is engaged in destabilizing activities. We also just think that even as we are vigilant, even as we develop capabilities to counter Iranian actions, we have to have an openness to pursuing diplomatic solutions or else the region is just going to see a perpetuation of the conflicts that have already caused so much suffering and instability.\nQ: Do you think it's irrational for the Saudis to worry that they're no longer the U.S.'s key ally?\nMR. RHODES: Well, I think on the core of the relationship, that remains very solid, and that includes our commitment to Saudi Arabian security and sovereignty. They are a country with whom we share significant interests in this region.\nSo we certainly understand this is their neighborhood. They're worried about Iran and what its agenda is, and the actions that they've taken. Our point is simply that that concern with Iran should not foreclose the potential for diplomatic engagement if there's an ability to resolve problems. And a recent example of course is the nuclear deal where, despite all of our concerns about Iran's behavior, we were able to see a significant rollback in the Iranian nuclear program because we pursued a diplomatic process.\nQ: Now that things are improving somewhat in Yemen, how soon do you expect to see some of these Gulf countries step up their contributions in the fight against ISIS? What do you expect that to look like, if you can give some kind of timeframe?\nAnd then on the Saudi bilat yesterday, did the issue of the 9/11 legislation come up at all? And how was that discussed?\nMR. RHODES: So on the first question, obviously Saudi Arabia, the UAE have exerted a lot of effort, a lot of resources in Yemen. If there is a political resolution to the conflict, if the cessation of hostilities holds, that will, in the first instance, allow for humanitarian assistance to get into Yemen. And that was discussed in the meeting yesterday. It would allow for stability on the Saudi border, which is important, obviously, for their security.\nIt would also allow for a focus on AQAP in Yemen. The civil conflict there in some ways, made it harder to make sure that we were preventing AQAP from trying to establish a safe haven, because groups like that thrive in the conflict environments. So one thing we would like to see is a renewed focus, of course, on AQAP.\nMore broadly, there are many different ways in which we want to support the operation and effort against ISIL. Some of that involves military action, and a number of these countries, of course, are flying with us in the coalition, and we're reviewing what can be done, for instance, in terms of providing support to the opposition and rolling back and holding territory that is taken from ISIL.\nBut there are other political steps that can be taken. And so, for instance, we believe that in order for the strategy to succeed in Iraq, the Iraqi government is going to need some support. We've taken back 40 percent of the territory from ISIL inside of Iraq, but we need to hold that territory. We need to develop those areas that have been devastated by ISIL's presence. And the countries here in the GCC can be helpful in that process, particularly given the fact that those areas in Iraq are Sunni-majority areas.\nAnd similarly, in Syria, we'd like to see them invested in both the support for the opposition, the efforts against ISIL, but also the political process that's going to be important to resolving the conflict there. All of the leaders around the table, all the countries around the table have relationships with the opposition in Syria that are important, and the more we're aligned, the more we're going to be effective in that process.\nQ: And the 9/11 --\nMR. RHODES: Oh, yes. The legislation did not come up in the bilateral meeting.\nQ: Wasn't that a big source of contention that we talked about, though? And did it matter that it didn't come up?\nMR. RHODES: My sense is that the Saudis are aware of the position that we've taken on the legislation, so it's not as if they needed to spend a lot of time addressing it with us. So it wasn't a subject at the bilat even as, obviously, there have been many statements about it over the last several days.\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Ben, I want to ask you about investment in not just armament and airplanes, but also investment in Special Forces and that sort of attack strategy for our Gulf partners. How does the conversation happen so that the President can get them away from, say, F-15s and more towards real steel on the ground, if you will?\nAnd a second question is, does the President take his own advice, which is to say, listen, if he wants the Saudis and others to engage with the Iranians directly, will he take a trip to Tehran or maybe engage with them directly?\nMR. RHODES: Well, first of all, your question is exactly the topic that we're focused on in terms of military capabilities. And we really initiated this process in Camp David, and since then, we've had a working group that meets regularly to review and develop these defense capabilities. Ash Carter had a meeting here yesterday with the defense ministers to focus on this. And we've seen some progress in terms of the types of capabilities that GCC countries are investing in. We've aimed to expedite the transfer of certain capabilities to them.\nAnd here's where the focus is: The large-scale weapons systems that we've sold over many years that are important to Gulf security are not necessarily the capabilities that are best designed to deal with the threats that we face. So, for instance, if you look at conflicts as diverse as Syria or Yemen, the ability to have a significant Special Forces capability makes a big difference. And so we're working to enhance and train and support the development of Gulf Special Forces, and that will be critical in dealing with the types of conflicts that we've seen here in the region.\nThe threat that they see from Iranian weapons shipments going to different groups in the region is best confronted by maritime interdiction capabilities. And this is often kind of small boats, not large naval movements. So we've been working to develop their maritime capacity.\nIran has a ballistic missile program and has an active cyber program. And our ability to work with the GCC to have an interoperable missile defense system will guard against that ballistic missile threat, give them greater assurance in their own security, just as they will want to have cyber defenses in the event of any Iranian cyber intrusion.\nSo we've made progress in each of those areas. We've worked to enhance Gulf capabilities in each of those areas. We have also worked to support interoperability between the GCC countries. And all of that is going to make them better prepared to deal with these threats. So these meetings are an opportunity to review that progress and determine what additional steps can be taken to expedite that process.\nYour second question was --\nQ: Does the President take his own advice.\nMR. RHODES: Oh, Iran. Yes. Well, I think the trip to Cuba was probably enough in terms of breaking a longstanding taboo. With respect to Iran, I think our approach has been that we will engage with the Iranians where we see an opportunity to make progress. The main vehicle for that engagement has been Secretary Kerry with Foreign Minister Zarif, not just on the Iranian nuclear issue but on Syria and other regional issues.\nThe President has always indicated that he is willing to engage the Iranian leadership if he believes that that can make progress on different issues. He's spoken to President Rouhani on the phone. The fact of the matter is we haven't seen from the Iranians I think a desire for that level of engagement. They've really focused on the channel between our foreign ministers. And so that's where I think it's most likely to continue.\nBut that speaks to what we're trying to foster, which is a dynamic where we can have a diplomatic dialogue with the Iranians on issues related to these regional conflicts. Precisely because Iran has had a role in these areas, we would like to try to move them in a more constructive direction. And that requires some amount of dialogue. It also requires vigilance in the type of military capabilities.\nMR. EARNEST: With that, we're told we have the pool on the phone now and can see if there are any questions they want to ask.\nQ: So, Ben, just to follow up on the question about the weapons system, you had talked about ways that the United States and the Gulf countries have a different tactic, even if you have the same goals. Would you put the weapons systems in that category? Do the Gulf countries, are they pressuring you to give them more traditional weapons like the F15, and you guys are trying to push them in the other direction with resources that would help you achieve the United States goal maybe more than the goals that they want to achieve?\nMR. RHODES: No, I think on the capabilities, we have a good amount of alignment. Certainly on the new capabilities that I discussed, I think the GCC countries recognize that it's in their interest to develop these capabilities.\nIf you look at the two threats that are most profound for them, it's Iran and ISIL. And both of them engage in asymmetric tactics, and so the ability to develop the types of capabilities I discussed I think is very relevant to their security. I think they do have an interest in these larger systems, and the fact of the matter is, when you talk about significant air assets, the U.S. government just has a process that it goes through to review those requests. We've made major weapon sales to Gulf states during President Obama's time in office. We'll continue to review requests for systems like F15s through our own government and in consultation with Congress.\nSo we're not resisting cooperation in those areas. What we are doing is focusing and prioritizing these capabilities to deal with asymmetric challenges.\nAnd where I'd discuss some tactical differences over the previous years, often that had to deal with how are we addressing the issues we've been discussing around prioritizing political processes in different conflicts and prioritizing obviously the fight against ISIL. Again, I think the Gulf states share the same objectives we have in those areas, and now that there is a cessation of hostilities in Yemen and in Syria, we believe that is the opening that should be pursued so that we're coupling both our security cooperation with our diplomatic cooperation.\nMR. EARNEST: Other questions from the pool on the phone?\nQ: I wanted to ask on the human rights area in the bilat yesterday, did the President raise any specific cases? There's been pressure from senators to actually discuss some of the cases including the blogger Raif Badawi and others? And then also, maybe this was asked but we couldn't hear the questions. In the war in Yemen, did any of the GCC countries ask for specific weapons or more U.S. assistance in Yemen?\nMR. RHODES: With respect to your second question, there was not really a discussion of U.S. military assistance in Yemen. We have provided some support to the GCC operation there, but I think because they're now in this window where there's a cessation of hostilities, the focus of the discussion was really on humanitarian access, humanitarian assistance to the people of Yemen, and the prospects for a political process, and our threat assessment as it relates to AQAP.\nOn your first question, the President did raise the issue of human rights. There was a very candid discussion around those issues yesterday. While he did not raise individual cases, he certainly did include in that discussion the concerns that have been raised around sentences that have been given out to bloggers and people expressing themselves online. So he was certainly alluding to cases like the one that you cite. That was one of the areas of focus in the human rights discussion.\nMR. EARNEST: Why don't we give the pool one more chance, and then we're going to questions in the room.\nQ: I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of atmospheric inside the room when the President has been speaking with these leaders. Secondly, what discussions did the President have with the Saudi King about the economy, specifically low oil prices, and the recent Saudi decision not to reduce or freeze production? And just following up on another question, were there specific conversations about helping in Yemen, specifically on AQAP? Is there specific U.S. aid coming directed to help these countries deal with AQAP?\nMR. RHODES: So on the atmospherics, I think yesterday the President had very long meetings with both King Salman and Mohammed bin Zayef of the UAE. I think that was probably his longest meeting, with King Salman. It went over two hours. I think it was a very open and honest discussion where they were able to discuss a whole range of issues, some of which we've been on strong agreement and some of which have been sources of tension.\nI think they both agreed that it was to essentially have this opportunity to clear the air and to reaffirm that even as there have been some tensions over the years, that on a set of core issues we are in alignment, whether that's counterterrorism, whether that's the security of our Gulf partners, whether that's the outcome that we would like to see in a conflict like Syria. So I think it definitely moved the ball forward in aligning our approaches, and they were able to be very open and honest and free-flowing with one another in their discussion.\nAnd that's, frankly, the purpose of these meetings, so that meeting regularly allows us, given the complexity of the region, to have a check-in on these issues and make sure we understand where everybody is coming from. And the meeting this morning is an open discussion. All the leaders were addressing those issues. And I think the President knows these leaders well, having been in office for over seven years now. So he has a good sense of where they're coming from, and I think they have a good sense of where he's coming from.\nThere was a brief discussion of the economy with King Salman yesterday. The President welcomed some of the efforts that have been discussed in Saudi Arabia to continue to reform their economy. There are some ambitious plans here, and the President indicated that he wants to be supportive in any way we can as the Saudis work to develop, diversify, enhance their economy going forward.\nOn oil, the President indicated our desire to simply continue to have a dialogue through our Energy Department and our normal channels. So it wasn't a particularly unusual discussion, but rather that's a part of our relationship and we want to continue to have an open dialogue so that we understand our shared strategies going forward.\nWith respect to AQAP, we've obviously remained active in targeting AQAP and we've taken many AQAP leaders off the battlefield, including the leader of AQAP. But, again, our concern is in part in the conflict environment, whether or not AQAP is able -- or was able to establish a foothold or presence in different areas. So I think what we'll be doing is sharing that threat assessment, and then discussing how we can take advantage of the cessation of hostilities to cooperate against AQAP going forward.\nSo that discussion at the GCC summit is actually one of the points at the lunch, so that's ongoing now, but yesterday this was alluded to obviously in his bilateral meetings.\nMR. EARNEST: Let's go back to questions in the room here.\nRon.\nQ: Just in terms of 9/11, to button this up, even though it did not come up in the bilateral, I'm curious as to -- and we know that the administration does not support the Senate bill. I believe that you are in favor of declassifying these 28 pages that have been in the news and so forth. So is it the administration's position that it stands by the previous findings of the commissions that have looked at this? Has the administration engaged the Saudis in any way now on 9/11 questions that are still out there, being raised by the families?\nAnd a second issue -- there are some reports that there are now more aggressive rules on engagement in the air campaign against ISIS. Is that, in fact, true? And there are concerns about increased number of civilian casualties. The main point of that, is there now going to be a faster tempo or more aggressive pace to the air campaign and other military operations on the ground as you approach Mosul and other places?\nMR. RHODES: So on your second question, no. And I think there have been some inaccurate reports out there. There have not been changes to the rules of engagement with respect to the air campaign. We believe that part of defeating ISIL is showing that we hold ourselves to a high standard on issues like civilian casualties. That's a significant part of what separates us from groups like ISIL or dictators like Bashar al-Assad. So we're going to be very aggressive, but we're also going to be very focused in our efforts to roll back ISIL.\nWe have taken a number of steps to try to enhance that campaign, and Secretary Carter addressed some of those in Iraq, in terms of our ability to provide more support to the Iraqi government and Kurdish forces, and our ability to have personnel who can support the ongoing efforts around Mosul. But part of those efforts with Special Forces -- part of those efforts are focused on making sure we have good targets\nSo in our view, the way to ensure that we're rolling back ISIL is not to shift to a more -- looser approach to rules of engagement, but rather to make sure we're gathering intelligence, partnering with forces on the ground, and finding and taking out ISIL targets. And again, that's what our Special Forces, including the augmentations that we've done recently, allow us to do.\nOn 9/11, on the legislation, I mean, I think it's just important to reiterate that our opposition to that legislation is not rooted in the Saudi bilateral relationship, it's rooted in our concern that if you set a precedent for removing sovereign immunity, you open up the United States to lawsuits and litigation and processes on a whole range of issues around the world. And so we simply believe it's not the way to address those concerns.\nWith respect to the 28 pages, the President has asked for this declassification review. We have been deferential to the DNI in leading that review, and so when that's done we'd expect that there will be some degree of declassification that provides more information.\nI will say that the joint inquiry report and those 28 pages and all the other materials that were developed in those initial months after 9/11 -- all of that fed into the 9/11 Commission's work. And we believe that that provided a definitive statement about the nature of support that came from Saudi Arabia or other countries with respect to al Qaeda financing. Obviously, it did not determine that the Saudi government had an intent to support al Qaeda.\nSo we believe that -- our understanding of 9/11 is well established. The U.S. government has been very clear about what we believe took place. And again, the question at issue in the 28 pages has to do with material that was drawn upon in all those subsequent investigations, notably the 9/11 Commission, which was very transparent in its findings.\nQ: Have you read them? Have you or the President read the 28 pages?\nMR. RHODES: Again, the President is familiar with their contents. I, in a previous life, obviously, worked with the 9/11 Commission, so I'm very familiar with their contents. And again, what they provided was I think important information, preliminary information as a part of the joint inquiries report that then was followed up on by the 9/11 Commission, which did subsequent interviews, investigations, and published its finding in the 9/11 report.\nSo I'm actually more familiar with this process from my previous life. And you know, I'm quite confident that the 9/11 Commission spent a good amount of time wrestling with what was in those 28 pages and making sure that they were following threads and leads that may have been present in those pages, and that ultimately -- was able to lay that out in the report and I think address some of those questions in the public testimony that the 9/11 commissioners did after the publication of the report.\nQ: -- said today that Russia had a considerable military presence in Syria. Do you see that as an obstacle for resolution on the ground? And second question, how would you describe the cessation of hostilities on the ground? Is it holding, in your view?\nMR. RHODES: So we've been concerned about reports of Russia moving materiel into Syria. We believe that President Putin is certainly on the record and went public with his statement that Russia would be removing its military personnel and presence in Syria. And we believe -- and President Obama said directly to President Putin when they spoke on the phone several days ago -- that Russia should focus its efforts on the diplomatic process, on maintaining the cessation of hostilities and working with the Syrian government to get them to take seriously the process of negotiation and, ultimately, transition.\nSo again, we think it would be negative for Russia to move additional military equipment or personnel into Syria. We believe that our efforts are best focused on supporting the diplomatic process.\nI think the cessation of hostilities has, over the last several weeks, provided an opening for the restoration of some degree of calm in areas in Syria and has allowed for the delivery of some amount of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people. We have seen persistent violations of the cessation of hostilities. We've seen those from the regime that is engaged in military activity, particularly in northwestern Syria. We've seen it from al Nusra, an extremist group, as well. And we've been concerned by an uptick in violations of the cessation of hostilities, including the regime not allowing for the delivery of humanitarian assistance in certain areas.\nSo it's important now that the U.S., our Gulf partners are reinforcing the importance of this opportunity, and we're strongly urging Russia to use its influence and, frankly, Iran as well, to try to sustain what has been an opening for the Syrian people to enjoy a greater degree of calm than we've of course had the last several years.\nQ: So do you think Russia is also violating?\nMR. RHODES: No, we think the Syrian regime has been violating, and al Nusra. Russia, of course has a great degree of influence, however, with the Syrian regime, so we would encourage Russia to press the Syrian government to abide by the cessation of hostilities. And certainly the movement of any additional Russian military support into Syria would be inconsistent with our shared objective of getting a political process moving.\nQ: On the issue of this 9/11 bill, there's, of course, the separate ruling by the Supreme Court with regard to the Iran case in allowing victims to have access to money from the Iran Central Bank, $2 billion. What is the White House's reaction to that ruling? And how do you see that comparing to it being different from this bill being debated in Congress?\nAnd then separately -- I may be pronouncing this wrong -- but there's a lot of talk of course about Saudi Arabia's support for a brand of Islam, Wahhabism. Understandably, that would be difficult to -- they're not going to change their support of this brand of Islam, but there's thinking that groups like al Qaeda or ISIS are inspired by this extreme and conservative view. Is there any way to discuss that, or is there any discussion of that either on the leader-presidential level or lower?\nMR. RHODES: So on the second question, I think the President -- look, obviously we inhabit very different cultures and have very different practices in the United States than Saudi Arabia. And the President respects, of course, Saudi Arabia's commitment to Islam and obviously plays a unique role of the host of the two most holy mosques within Islam.\nAt the same time, what we've focused on is making sure that, number one, there's a sustained effort to combat any financing of extremism from any individuals in Saudi Arabia or anywhere else. We work with many countries around the world to ensure that we're drawing up any pools of funding that might go to terrorism. And so that has been a subject of conversation.\nAnd also, the President I think has been clear not just privately but publicly if you think about the speech he gave at the United Nations the year before last about the need for countries to not just fight against ISIL, but to publicly reject and show that these more virulent strains that we see from ISIL and al Qaeda are demonstrated to be incompatible with Islam.\nSo it's incumbent upon everybody to reject more extremist ideologies, to reject any extremist interpretation of Islam that could lead to violence. And so we would like to see all countries in this region do that.\nI think we are seeing, since ISIL established itself, a greater willingness by countries to engage in that type of effort. The UAE hosts a center that is dedicated to combatting the ideology that underpins ISIL. Saudi Arabia has discussed a similar effort, and we would welcome them doing so.\nSo, again, we obviously don't get into discussion of Islamic doctrine. What we do discuss is the need to combat any extremist ideologies, and to do so by making sure that they cannot be financed and making sure that people all around the world are speaking out against anything that leads to violence.\nYour first question was?\nQ: Supreme Court.\nMR. RHODES: Supreme Court, yes. So the specific Supreme Court decision dealt with a question of separation of powers. And it determined that a bill that was passed through Congress and signed by the President could serve as a means for victims of terrorism to seek assets from the Iranian government. We, of course, very much support the efforts of those families.\nI think the distinction is, in this specific case, you're dealing with a state sponsor or terrorism, Iran. That has a very specific designation. And that, frankly, also carries with it a whole host of tools that we use, including sanctions and other types of steps that we would not take against Saudi Arabia or other countries.\nSo given Iran's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and given the various financial tools that we have to hold them accountable to designated individuals, we believe that part of that is allowing for this type of process to go forward. The problem with the JASTA legislation is it applies to all countries. It would suggest that the principle of sovereign immunity does not hold for countries. And again, that opens the door to potential blowback on the United States.\nSo while we understand and are sympathetic to the concerns of 9/11 families and have worked to support them in many different ways over the years, on this specific legislation, again, it's not an objection related to Saudi Arabia, it's an objection related to the principle that it might establish internationally.\nMR. EARNEST: I think it warrants mentioning also that the Department of Justice did make an argument in the case, and the Supreme Court essentially ruled in favor of the argument that we were making. So we've been pretty consistent in making this argument, dating back several years now.\nOther questions?\nColleen.\nQ: This will be the President's last trip here during his administration, and I wondered if you could just give a broader assessment of how he's leaving the relationship versus where it stood seven years ago. And also I wondered if any discussion came up about his potential successor, and concerns about that.\nMR. RHODES: Well, on the first question, one thing I do think it's worth doing is stepping back and for all the discussion about tensions, it's hardly the first time in which there have been disagreements or tensions in the U.S.-Saudi relationship. The Saudis weren't particularly enthusiastic about the war in Iraq and certainly were not supportive of the Maliki government.\nSo when we took office, for instance, they didn't have a diplomatic presence in Iraq. They were very concerned about the direction of events there. And that had been a source of disagreement.\nIn terms of where things stand today versus when we took office, I think on the core issue of how are we supporting Saudi Arabia and its security, and how are we cooperating on counterterrorism, that cooperation remains strong. Our defense relationship remains strong and in some ways has been enhanced over the last seven years. And our counterterrorism cooperation is very broad. I think really the changes have been more in just what are the first order of priorities in the region. When we took office, it was the presence of 150,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, and a significant concern about al Qaeda. We've significantly reduced the U.S. military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. We've significantly rolled back al Qaeda.\nI think today, of course, the concern is more on the threat posed by ISIL and regional conflicts particularly in Syria and Iraq and Yemen. Again, I think what the President hopes to leave at the conclusion of his time in office is a situation where we have significantly rolled back ISIL and its safe havens just as we have been able to do with al Qaeda; that we have a political framework around these regional conflicts so that there's a basis for the next administration to work to enhance stability here in the region. And Saudi Arabia is going to be an important part of that.\nSo there's always a degree of challenges here in the Middle East, in the Gulf. I think the President is focused on how can we have the right capabilities and how can we align approaches so that we're more capable promoting stability. And on that score, I think meetings like today's are very important because if you look at where we were at Camp David and where we are today, we've made a substantial amount of progress. And part of that is because we have to continue to talk to each other -- it's not just these summits, these summits have led to much greater engagement at the diplomatic and military and intelligence level as well.\nQ: And on a successor?\nMR. RHODES: That did not come up in -- well, actually, it did not come up other than the notion that we made clear that we believe that the basis of the work that we're doing is likely to continue because a lot of this is how is the U.S. government, Defense Department, and the intelligence community engaging counterparts and so there's a lot of lines of effort that are not going to stop on Election Day or Inauguration Day. Obviously the new administration will have its own approach to things but, frankly, what we're doing is creating habits of cooperation within our government, and we did make clear that we thought that that would continue under the next administration.\nMR. EARNEST: We've probably got time for one or two more.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thank you. Have lessons from Libya formed discussions around Syria? So is the administration still determined that Assad must go? And was Libya a topic of discussion at all? Also, it sounds like the discussion have centered specifically around AQAP. Is al Qaeda in Maghreb a completely discussion or strategy? And then on a slightly different note, the administration has engaged Cuba and Iran. Are there any plans to engage North Korea? And if not, why not North Korea? I read reports recently that the North Korean regime has made noise about reaching out.\nMR. RHODES: So on Libya, it has been a topic of discussion. And I think the focus here has been on how can we work to support the Government of National Accord. A lot of nations here have a lot of influence in Libya, and what we would like to see is the opportunity of a new government that enjoys international support being able to take hold, establish its presence, establish its authority in Libya, and that is going to be much easier to do if all the different countries that have been providing support into Libya are working towards the same outcome. So a lot of the focus here was on, again, how can we align our support to forces in Libya to strengthen this new government.\nWith Syria, I do think we take lessons from -- well, not just Libya but Iraq that you can't just simply have military solutions to these challenges. We believe Assad has to go precisely because we don't think any political process could work with him in power, given the fact that he slaughtered his own people, given the fact that he is rejected by a majority of his own population.\nSo we have not said that we would impose a military regime change on Syria. What we've said is that there should be a political transition in which he leaves power for the sake of the country and the Syrian people.\nAQIM obviously is a significant concern for the United States. I think there is a greater degree of focus in these discussions here on ISIL and AQAP simply because of the geography -- that they're very active in this area -- AQAP of course in Yemen, and ISIL in countries across the Middle East. But the United States remains deeply engaged in the effort against AQAP -- AQIM. And, in fact, the Moroccan king was here yesterday. Morocco, Algeria, others are CT partners in that effort.\nFrankly, the effort to stabilize Libya would be very relevant to our ability to make sure that there's not safe havens for either ISIL or al Qaeda inside of that country.\nNorth Korea, frankly, just has not indicated any degree of seriousness about denuclearization. We've said we'd be open to engagement with North Korea if they are serious about meeting their past commitments and moving towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We've seen the opposite from the North Koreans in their behavior.\nI think the Iran deal demonstrates that diplomacy can resolve these issues, but ultimately the North Koreans have not taken that path.\nMR. EARNEST: We've probably got time for one more if there are any more.\nYes?\nQ: Molly Hunter from ABC. You shared the Saudis' assessment with Iran and sharing those fears, but you also mentioned a new and improved relationship with the Gulf. How far are the Gulf partners willing to go? Obviously something that this afternoon session will be focused on, but what indications have you gotten from the Gulf partners that they are willing to bring Iran into the fold?\nMR. RHODES: Yes, I mean, look, I think we share the assessment of Iranian behavior. We do think that it's imperative that we're focused on the fight against ISIL and that we can have an openness to diplomacy and engagement with Iran in the service of resolving regional conflicts. I think we've gotten thus far from the Gulf countries and the Saudis yesterday certainly a lot of concerns about Iran, but an openness to that engagement. They have not expressed an opposition to the notion that they would have some diplomatic contact or dialogue with the Iranians.\nI do think that they're very skeptical, and I think that's not a surprise to anybody. Our point is simply that we can put ourselves in a position of strength, we can do that in part from the development of the capabilities that I talked about. At the same time, the best way to try to resolve these issues and encourage Iran to move in a more constructive direction is a mix of standing up to Iran when it's necessary but also being open to diplomacy where we can make progress.\nAnd the fact of the matter is, Iran itself is not monolithic. There are elements of the Iranian system that are more invested in conflict and that there are elements of the Iranian system that are more open to diplomacy. And part of what we've indicated is it's important for us to work with those inside of Iran who are more open to a constructive relationship, rather than to allow the hardliners there to dominate the regional engagement.\nMR. EARNEST: Thanks, everybody. You'll have an opportunity to hear from the President at the conclusion of the summit, and we'll see you in London.\nEND 2:14 P.M.

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117190", "text": "READING, Pa. – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday talked about jobs and unfair trade deals as he returned to the campaign trail in Pennsylvania ahead of next Tuesday's primaries here and in four other Atlantic coast states.\nHe also split with Clinton over her support on Wednesday for a regressive tax on soft drinks, juice drinks, sports drinks and teas.\nDuring his speech to more than 2,600 supporters at the Santander Performing Arts Center, Sanders detailed differences with Clinton on issues ranging from health care to the environment and from the minimum wage to college affordability.\nOne key difference he detailed was on trade policies that have destroyed decent-paying jobs in the United States. \"We have seen the middle class of this country decline,\" Sanders told more than 2,600 supporters at the Santander Performing Arts Center.\nSanders led the fight in Congress against the North American Free Trade Agreement and other job-killing trade pacts that Clinton supported. Pennsylvania was especially hard hit by a manufacturing decline in the past 15 years that saw 60,000 factories and almost 5 million jobs disappear as companies moved operations to low-wage countries overseas.\nHershey in 2009 shut its York Peppermint Patties plant here and 300 jobs were shifted to Monterey, Mexico where workers are paid a fraction of what they were paid in Pennsylvania. Sony in 2008 closed the last TV manufacturing plant in the U.S. in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania, destroying 560 Pennsylvania jobs when the plant was moved to Baja, Mexico.\nCampaign funding was another major difference with Clinton. Sanders on Wednesday reported raising a record $46 million last month, mostly in donations averaging about $27 apiece. Clinton raised $19 million in her traditional campaign fund last month and another $11.8 million for a super PAC, Priorities USA Action, which is funded by wealthy donors and special interests.\nTurning to immigration policy, Sanders spoke out on a local issue. \"It is time to shut down the Berks Family Detention Center,\" he said. \"The government should not be in the painful and inhumane business of locking up families who have fled unspeakable violence in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and other countries throughout the world. Instead, we should treat these families with the compassion, the dignity and the respect they deserve.\"\nThe rally here followed a stop earlier Thursday in Scranton. The Vermont senator was headed later for an event in the Philadelphia suburbs.\nMeanwhile, Sanders spoke out on a proposal by Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney to provide universal pre-school for all 4-year olds in Philadelphia.\n\"Making sure that every family has high quality, affordable pre-school and childcare is a vision that I strongly share. On the other hand, I do not support paying for this proposal through a regressive tax on soda and juice drinks that will significantly increase taxes on low-income and middle class Americans,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, it should be the people on top who see an increase in their taxes, not low-income and working people.\"\nSanders also chided Clinton for supporting the soda tax. \"Frankly, I am very surprised that Secretary Clinton would support this regressive tax after pledging not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. This proposal clearly violates her pledge. A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia.\"", "timestamp": "2016-04-21", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Contrasts with Clinton on Jobs, Trade"}

Today, he joined them in calling for grown men to be allowed to use little girls' public restrooms. As the dad of young daughters, I dread what this will mean for our daughters — and for our sisters and our wives. It is a reckless policy that will endanger our loved ones.\n\"Yet Donald stands up for this irresponsible policy while at the same time caving in on defending individual freedoms and religious liberty. He has succumbed to the Left's agenda, which is to force Americans to leave God out of public life while paying lip service to false tolerance.\n\"This is not real tolerance. The Left wants to force its belief system onto Americans across the country and silence people of faith in the public square. Unsurprisingly, Donald Trump is all too eager to join them. This simply confirms that the same man who favored partial-birth abortion and still supports public funding for Planned Parenthood will sacrifice principle on the altar of political correctness. Trump will not defeat political correctness. Today he bowed to it.\"\nCruz also spoke about this on Glenn Beck's radio show today. Full interview may be viewed here, excerpts below.\nBECK: Let's just start with the genderless bathrooms… because we were talking about this. North Carolina, Mississippi standing up for the right to practice your religion… You can go get a wedding cake at another store just down the street, I'm sure. Practice your religion and the genderless bathrooms… the UK has just come out with a travel advisory to LBGT in London, in England, that you should be warned about North Carolina and Mississippi.\nCRUZ: Well, listen, we have gone off the deep end. This is absurd. Number one, religious liberty is our founding liberty, this country was literally founded by men and women who were fleeing religious oppression and coming to a land where we could live according to our faith and conscience without government getting in the way. It wasn't too long ago—\nBECK: Go ahead—\nCRUZ: —that religious liberty was a bipartisan commitment. It has only been in recent years that the modern democratic party, aided and abetted by the mainstream media and Hollywood, has decided religious liberty is inconsistent with their extreme political protections -political bias—and that's just wrong. I think that the 2016 election will be about many things but one of the things it will be is a religious liberty election. If you believe that the first amendment protects the rights of all of us —of Jews, Christians, Muslims, of atheists, of all of us, to live according to our faith, then there is only one candidate running who has spent his entire adult life fighting to defend religious liberty and the first amendment, and the bill of rights, and the constitution.\nBECK: OK Ted, tell me this, how do you, and, I'm sorry, we need to move as quickly as we can. How do you make the case to people, this isn't because I hate transgendered people? I'm concerned about my daughter and my wife in a bathroom not from the transgendered people but from the heterosexual pervert, yes, the heterosexual pervert that will use this.\nCRUZ: Well, a part of it, Glenn, this is not complicated to make the case… Most people know this intuitively and, as you know, my daughters are five and eight. My five-year-old knows the difference between boys and girls. You've got the Obama education department suing to try to force junior highs to let teenage boys shower with teenage girls.\nBECK: Oh my gosh.\nCRUZ : That's crazy. It's just, that's not a reasonable position. It is simply crazy. The idea that grown men would be allowed alone in a bathroom with little girls… you don't need to be a behavioral psychologist to realize bad things can happen and any prudent person wouldn't allow that. It is only the lunacy of political correctness -if he had fired Curt Schilling—for making the rather obvious point, that we shouldn't allow grown adult men strangers alone in a bathroom with little girls... That's a point anyone who is rational should understand.\nBECK: I will tell you that we always hear from the left on gun control… if it would just save one person then we should do it. If this would just save one little girl from being molested by a heterosexual pervert, we should do it.\nCRUZ: Glenn, I was the Solicitor General of Texas for five and a half years. I handled case after case after case of child molesters, of pedophiles, of people who abused little kids. These are serious issues and when you deal with people who are repulsive perverts and criminals… there are some bad people in the world and we shouldn't be facilitating putting little girls alone in a bathroom with grown adult men.

This partnership is based on reciprocal commitments to improve the security, stability, and prosperity of the region. Over the past year, we have convened several U.S.-GCC minister-level meetings, and had dozens of bilateral conversations, with the aim of translating the commitments from the Camp David Summit into concrete actions. U.S and Gulf defense ministers met on April 20 in Riyadh and determined additional measures to further strengthen security cooperation, especially efforts to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Foreign ministers met most recently on April 7 in Manama, Bahrain to prepare for the April 21 U.S.-GCC Riyadh summit. This cabinet-level engagement complements extensive leader-level outreach by the President, to include his fourth visit to Saudi Arabia - the most ever by a sitting U.S. president - and also hosting His Majesty King Salman to Washington in September 2015.\nDefeating ISIL and Stabilizing the Region\nThe United States is working with GCC states to resolve conflicts and reduce regional tensions.\n• Counter-ISIL. All GCC countries are members of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL. Contributions range from flying missions as part of the air campaign, to leading the Coalition's working group on counter terrorist financing, and launching new centers for countering terrorist messaging.\n• Yemen. We worked with GCC states to foster a nation-wide cessation of hostilities. In addition to encouraging all parties to reach a durable political settlement, the United States and the GCC states are supporting the international humanitarian response and collaborating to more effectively combat al-Qa'ida and ISIL in Yemen.\n• Iraq. Supported by the Counter-ISIL Coalition, Iraqi forces have pushed ISIL back from more than 40 percent of the territory it once controlled. At the Summit, leaders underscored the importance of stabilizing areas of Iraq liberated from ISIL in order to ensure its defeat.\n• Syria. The United States and GCC countries supported the cessation of hostilities and political talks to achieve a political transition away from Asad. Leaders committed to redouble support for the cessation and to encourage sustained engagement by all parties in the Geneva talks.\n• Libya. Following the Camp David Summit, GCC countries worked more closely to stabilize Libya. Leaders pledged to bolster the Government of National Accord and mitigate the actions of any spoilers.\n• Iran. GCC countries joined the United States in supporting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. In Riyadh, leaders discussed the challenges posed by Iran's problematic regional activities and underscored the importance of an inclusive approach to de-escalating regional conflicts.?\nSecurity Cooperation\nFive working groups have been established to strengthen U.S.-GCC security cooperation, as committed at the Camp David Summit. Each working group has convened twice, bringing together experts to discuss cooperation in the areas of: counterterrorism; ballistic missile defense; military preparedness and training; streamlining the transfer of critical defense capabilities; and cyber security. Specialized working groups have also convened on Special Operations Forces (SOF), maritime cooperation, countering terrorist financing, and countering terrorist messaging. Among the outcomes of these working groups and related bilateral engagements:\n• Briefed GCC countries on the initial findings of a U.S. study offering recommendations for establishing a GCC-wide ballistic missile early warning system.\n• Expedited the process for transfers of equipment for GCC member states to strengthen their ability to contribute to their defense and the counter-ISIL campaign;\n• Enhanced cooperation on cybersecurity, including with respect to critical infrastructure;\n• Strengthened regional counter terrorist finance and anti-money laundering regimes, including through a GCC-wide conference on addressing the misuse of charity for terrorist financing, and a public and private banking dialogue;\n• Increased most GCC states' Force Activity Designator priority levels for requested military articles, giving them priority access for parts from U.S. stockpiles;\n• Hosted GCC member delegations for visits to U.S. counterterrorism and screening centers, in order to share information on foreign terrorist fighters;\n• Supported GCC countries' development of a network of countering violent extremist messaging practitioners, including through the exchange of best practices; and\n• Increased coordination to disrupt Hizballah's operational networks and activities in the Gulf through the use of law enforcement and counterterrorism-finance tools.\nAdditional security initiatives endorsed by leaders at the Riyadh Summit include:\n• GCC SOF Response Force Initiative. This framework will pair elite special operations forces from each GCC member state with U.S. trainers, in both bilateral and multilateral settings. These SOF partnerships will allows us to maintain close communications, ensure interoperability, and plan jointly to confront regional terrorist threats.\n• Intelligence Exchange. An exchange among U.S. and GCC experts will be formalized to inform ongoing work on a common approach to regional challenges.\n• Ballistic Missile Defense. Leaders committed to accelerate efforts to field an integrated GCC Ballistic Missile Early Warning System that would help counter regional threats. As a next step in this process, GCC countries will participate in a Ballistic Missile Defense Senior Leader Seminar in May 2016, to include a tabletop simulation exercise that will underscore the importance of regional ballistic missile defense cooperation.\n• Significant Military Exercise. Leaders finalized plans to begin immediately planning for a significant U.S.-GCC military exercise, to be held in March 2017. It will showcase the full breadth of U.S.-GCC security capabilities across all domains, and emphasize furthering the interoperability of U.S. and GCC forces and demonstrating joint, multilateral, and inter-government operations as part of a U.S.-GCC Combined Joint Task Force to collectively address pressing security issues. Ahead of the exercise, GCC countries will participate in defense-focused symposia on critical skills such as combat medical care, logistics, strategic communication, and also a strategy and planning group.\n• Peacetime Cyber Norms. Acknowledging the need for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, leaders stated their support for key concepts that will promote an environment of global cyber stability. These include the affirmation of the applicability of international law to state conduct in cyberspace and of voluntary norms of responsible state behavior in peacetime previously affirmed by leaders of the G-20.\n• Maritime Cooperation. As part of expanded cooperation, the United States and GCC countries committed to joint maritime patrols over the next year, to ensure shared situational awareness and improve maritime security.\nEconomic and Energy Cooperation\nConsistent with the emphasis at the Camp David Summit on strengthening governance, leaders at the Riyadh Summit committed to launch a new ministerial-level U.S.-GCC economic and energy dialogue this year. It will provide a forum to discuss GCC countries' plans to adopt new policies that could make available additional resources to meet their citizens' needs, and more broadly facilitate a dialogue on the challenges posed by low oil prices and growing youth populations. Other potential topics for this dialogue include: steps to improve the investment environment in GCC countries; development of sovereign bond markets; reduction of fossil fuel subsidies; climate finance; and potential policy approaches to macro-economic and energy trends. This ministerial dialogue will complement extensive U.S. bilateral economic and investment engagement with GCC members, as well as ongoing engagement with GCC countries on clean energy and climate policy.\nClimate Cooperation\nThe United States and GCC countries committed to work together on a 2016 Amendment to the Montreal Protocol to reduce the production and consumption of harmful hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These greenhouse gases can be up to 10,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide in contributing to climate change. A 2016 amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down HFCs would achieve substantial greenhouse gas reductions and could avoid up to 0.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100.\nHumanitarian Cooperation\nThe United States and GCC countries are partnering to help meet the extraordinary humanitarian needs facing the more than 18 million Syrians, including nearly 5 million refugees, people affected by violence in Syria and other regional conflicts. To date, the United States has led the way in contributing more than $5 billion in aid since the start of the Syrian conflict. GCC countries have collectively contributed over $2.5 billion. Ahead of the High Level Summit on Refugees, which the President will host on the margins of the 2016 U.N. General Assembly in New York, GCC countries will work to expand their assistance to refugees.", "timestamp": "2016-04-21", "title": "Fact Sheet: Implementation of the U.S.-Gulf Cooperation Council Strategic Partnership"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118143", "text": "Since the beginning of his Administration, President Obama has focused on creating an economy that works for every American. Under President Obama, our economy has added 14.4 million jobs over 73 straight months, the longest streak of job creation on record. The jobs available today, and the jobs of the future, are higher-skill jobs that require more education and advanced skills.\nJob-driven apprenticeships are among the surest pathways to provide American workers from all backgrounds with the skills and knowledge they need to acquire good-paying jobs and grow the economy. In fact, 87 percent of apprentices are employed after completing their programs, with an average starting wage above $50,000. The return on investment for employers is also impressive — international studies suggest that for every dollar spent on apprenticeship, employers may get an average of $1.47 back in increased productivity, reduced waste and greater front-line innovation. As a result, the President has made expanding apprenticeship a priority for his Administration.\nSince the President's 2014 State of the Union call to action, the U.S. has added more than 75,000 new apprenticeships, the largest increase in nearly a decade. And last year, the President signed into law the first-ever annual funding for apprenticeship in the Fiscal Year 2016 spending bill, following a bipartisan agreement based on the President's budget request.\nToday, the Department of Labor is announcing the Administration's latest step to increase access to apprenticeship - using the $90 million provided in that spending bill for new investments through ApprenticeshipUSA to expand apprenticeship in the United States, including:\n• $60 million to support state strategies to expand apprenticeship, including funding for regional industry partnerships and innovative strategies that diversify apprenticeship locally;\n• $30 million to catalyze industry partnerships in fast-growing and high-tech industries, to support organizations focused on increasing diversity, and to launch national efforts to make it easier for employers to start and for workers to find apprenticeship opportunities.\nBuilding on the bipartisan support for apprenticeship, the Department of Labor intends to make multi-year grants and contract awards to winning states, non-profits, workforce intermediaries, and industry associations subject to the availability of funding through the appropriations process using the $90 million provided through bipartisan support in the FY2016 spending bill for the first year of the awards.\nInvesting $60 Million to Support Smart State Strategies to Expand Apprenticeship\nToday, the Department of Labor is announcing a first step in investing in state apprenticeship strategies. Recognizing Governors' unique ability to create smart statewide strategies to expand apprenticeship, the Department is making up to $9.5 million available for ApprenticeshipUSA State Accelerator Grants, for states to develop strategic plans and build partnerships for apprenticeship expansion and diversification. States will also receive support to develop comprehensive game plans for encouraging businesses to launch apprenticeship programs in a variety of industries including advanced manufacturing, health care, IT, construction, and transportation.\nThese state accelerator grants will be followed this spring by a $50 million ApprenticeshipUSA State Expansion Grants Competition to scale-up state efforts to expand apprenticeship. The expansion grants will help states integrate apprenticeship into their education and workforce systems; engage industry and other partners at scale to expand apprenticeship to new sectors and new populations; support state capacity to conduct outreach and work with employers to start new programs; provide support to promote greater inclusion and diversity in apprenticeship; and implement state innovations, incentives and system reforms. By investing in state strategies for growing apprenticeship opportunities, these funds will help strengthen the foundation for the rapid and sustained expansion of quality apprenticeship nationwide.\nThe ApprenticeshipUSA state investments build on the demonstrated success several states have already shown in expanding apprenticeship. With the leadership of Governors across the country, 14 states have increased the number of apprentices in their state by over 20 percent - including:\n• Iowa, which tripled state funds to support apprenticeship across key industries\n• California, which unlocked additional funds to cover training costs,\n• Georgia, which brought together its workforce development and community college systems to partner with over thirty major employers on apprenticeship,\n• Connecticut, which launched a Manufacturing Innovation Fund to support employers engaged in apprenticeship expansion.\nProviding $30 Million for Industry Partnerships, Innovations to Enhance Diversity, and Access to Apprenticeship\nThrough ApprenticeshipUSA, the Department of Labor will also make investments to help more employers start or grow apprenticeship programs, particularly in high-growth and high-tech industries like health care, IT and advanced manufacturing where apprenticeship has not been as broadly adopted. Through industry-driven partnerships, these investments will focus on leveraging collaborations with workforce development organizations, industry associations, labor groups, and training providers to help multiple employers at a time accelerate the expansion of apprenticeship nationwide.\nIndustry and training intermediaries can provide support for individual employers and entire industries as they seek to start or expand apprenticeship. For example, through one such partnership, the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and healthcare employers ranging from Pfizer to the Seattle Children's Hospital joined forces to create an industry-recognized apprenticeship preparing workers for careers in healthcare services and hospital IT, leveraging common industry-approved curriculum and training solutions. The Department of Labor's investments will help spur similar collaborations across growing, high-skills industries.\nExpanding Registered Apprenticeship also means opening up opportunities to traditionally underrepresented populations including women, minorities, and people with disabilities, tapping into the full range of America's talent. While all of the ApprenticeshipUSA investments include a focus on making apprenticeships more inclusive, the Department of Labor, through ApprenticeshipUSA, will invest in strategies specifically focused on building pathways to apprenticeship, expanding recruiting and other strategies for attracting diverse participants, and in national innovations that promote greater access to apprenticeships for traditionally underrepresented groups.\nThese national investments will complement investments made at the state level, ensuring that state strategies embrace diversity in apprenticeship. They will also support national efforts to engage community-based organizations, workforce intermediaries and other non-profits in the development and implementation of pathways to apprenticeship including pre-apprenticeship, supportive services, and youth apprenticeships. In addition, the Department of Labor will invest in national activities to increase access to apprenticeship including strategic marketing and outreach, technology improvements and innovations that make it easier for employers to start apprenticeships and for job-seekers to connect with apprenticeship opportunities.\nFor more information on the timeline of additional investments and deadlines for proposals, please visit http://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship\nBuilding on Success in Expanding Apprenticeship and Increase Access to Jobs-Driven Training\nToday's announcement builds on the Obama Administration's previous efforts to increase access to apprenticeship and jobs-driven training to prepare workers for high-skill jobs available today, including:\n• Investing an unprecedented $175 million in American Apprenticeship Grants.\nIn September 2015, the Department of Labor announced $175 million in grants to 46 public-private partnerships between employers, organized labor, non-profits, local governments, and educational institutions that are expanding high-quality apprenticeships. The grantees are well on their way to creating and filling more than 34,000 new apprentices in high-growth and high-tech industries including health care, IT and advanced manufacturing over the next five years.\n• Highlighting the value of apprenticeships through LEADERS. More than 170 employers, colleges, and labor organizations have signed on to be ApprenticeshipUSA LEADERS (Leaders of Excellence in Apprenticeship Development, Education and Research) by starting or expanding their own work-based learning programs and encouraging their peers to follow. Together, employers in the LEADERS program have pledged to create nearly 20,000 new apprenticeship positions.\n• Expanding opportunities for apprentices to earn college credit towards a degree.\nMore than 200 colleges nationwide have joined the Registered Apprenticeship-College Consortium, which allows graduates of Registered Apprenticeship programs to turn their on-the-job and classroom training into college credits toward an associate or bachelor degree.\n• Directing training investments into job-driven strategies. Following the Vice President's Job-Driven Training review, federal agencies have taken actions to make programs serving over 21 million Americans every year more effective and accountable for preparing Americans for good jobs that employers need to fill. These actions include ensuring training investments include essential elements that matter most for getting Americans into better jobs— such as strong employer engagement, work-based learning approaches like apprenticeship, better use of labor market information, and accountability for employment outcomes.

Mr. President, on behalf of my brothers, the leaders of the GCC countries, and on my personal behalf, I'd like to thank you for attending this constructive and fruitful summit, which will contribute to enhancing the consultation and cooperation between the GCC countries and the United States.\nI commend the constructive discussions and the points reached. I would like to emphasize the keenness and commitment of the GCC countries to develop the historical and strategic relations between our respective countries and the United States of America to serve our mutual interest as well as the security and peace of the region and the world.\nWe wish you all health and happiness, and we wish our countries and peoples security, stability, and prosperity.\nPresident Obama. Well, thank you very much, Your Majesty.\nOnce again, I want to thank His Majesty and the Government and people of Saudi Arabia for their hospitality, as well as Secretary General Zayani and all of our GCC countries for another successful summit.\nI just want to make a brief comment on what we've accomplished. Last year, at our summit at Camp David, we agreed to build an even stronger partnership between our nations. We already had strong bilateral relations and, collectively, had a shared vision of peace and prosperity in the region. But we felt that we could do more, given the new challenges that had arisen.\nToday we reviewed the important progress that we've made together. I reaffirmed the policy of the United States to use all elements of our power to secure our core interests in the Gulf region and to deter and confront external aggression against our allies and our partners. And we reached a common vision on how to move forward together in key areas.\nWe remain united in our fight to destroy ISIL, or Daesh, which is a threat to all of us. And the United States will help our GCC partners ensure that their special operations forces are interoperable, and GCC nations will continue to increase their contributions to the fight against ISIL and the coalition that we've formed. We'll continue to offer support to Iraq as it liberates and stabilizes towns and cities from ISIL control, and we'll remain leading donors of humanitarian aid to the peoples of Syria and Iraq who have suffered so much.\nWe agreed to continue working closely to deescalate and resolve regional conflicts. In Syria, the cessation of hostilities is obviously under tremendous strain, including continued violations by the Asad regime. This violence is yet another reminder that there's only one way to end this civil war, as our GCC partners agree: a transitional governing body, a new Constitution with free elections, including a transition away from Asad.\nWith regard to Yemen, we urged all parties to abide by the cessation of hostilities so that humanitarian aid can be reached to the Yemeni people and the peace process can proceed. With regard to Libya, we agreed to keep building support for the new national unity Government. Given the ongoing threats in the region, the United States will continue to increase our security cooperation with our GCC partners, including helping them improve their own capacity to defend themselves.\nAnd I thanked our GCC partners for their support of the comprehensive deal that has now cut off every single one of Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon. That makes the region safer. We'll remain vigilant to ensure that Iran fulfills its commitments, just as we will fulfill ours.\nEven with the nuclear deal, we recognize collectively that we continue to have serious concerns about Iranian behavior. Our nations committed to continuing to interdict illegal Iranian arms shipments in the region, impose costs on Iran for its ballistic missile program, and oppose Iran's destabilizing activities in the region.\nAt the same time, as I said at Camp David last year, none of our nations have an interest in conflict with Iran. We welcome an Iran that plays a responsible role in the region, one that takes concrete, practical steps to build trust and resolve its differences with its neighbors by peaceful means and abides by international rules and norms.\nAnd finally, even as these summits focus on security issues, it remains the case that true and lasting security also depends on governance and an economy that serves all its citizens and respects universal human rights. And with this in mind, the United States and the GCC will launch a new high-level economic dialogue with a focus on adjusting to lower oil prices, increasing our economic ties, and supporting GCC reforms as they work to provide jobs and opportunities to their young people and all of their citizens.\nSo again, I want to thank His Majesty and all of our GCC partners for this very successful summit. When we look back on the past year, a lot has gotten done. I'm confident that a year from now we will be able to say that because of these actions, all of our nations are more peaceful and more secure and more prosperous. And it underscores the enduring friendship and partnership between the United States and the countries that are represented around this table.\nThank you for your hospitality.", "timestamp": "2016-04-21", "title": "Remarks With King Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia Following a Meeting With Gulf Cooperation Council Leaders in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"}

An original was not available for verification of the content of this joint statement.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117432", "text": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\nAt the invitation of King Salman ibn Abdulaziz, heads of State and Government of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member countries and the United States convened today in Riyadh to reaffirm the GCC-U.S. strategic partnership in pursuit of a stable, secure, and prosperous region. They reviewed the substantial progress made since the first GCC-U.S. Summit in May 2015 at Camp David, including measures to strengthen GCC-U.S. cooperation and deepen the partnership between the GCC and the United States. Recognizing the scope of the region's challenges, leaders also committed to urgently undertake additional steps to intensify the campaign to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, Daesh) and al-Qa'ida; de-escalate and seek to resolve regional conflicts; strengthen GCC states' capacity to address external and internal threats; and address Iran's destabilizing activities, while also working to reduce regional and sectarian tensions that fuel instability.\nStabilizing the Region\nThe leaders discussed a shared vision for addressing the most pressing conflicts in the region, welcoming the important progress achieved since the Camp David summit, while also underscoring the need to solidify gains. To build on this progress, leaders reaffirmed their support for the common principles decided at Camp David, including a shared recognition that there is no military solution to the region's armed civil conflicts, which can only be resolved through political and peaceful means; respect for all states' sovereignty and non-interference in their internal affairs; and the need for inclusive governance in conflict-ridden societies as well as protection of all minorities and of human rights.\nThe leaders expressed solidarity with the Syrian people and emphasized the importance of the full implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254, to include immediate humanitarian access to besieged and hard-to-reach areas and the release of any arbitrarily detained persons. Leaders also emphasized their resolve to strengthen the cessation of hostilities. They reaffirmed the need for a political transition away from Bashar Asad that preserves state institutions and sustains renewed focus on the fight against ISIL and the Nusrah Front.\nThe GCC and United States also expressed their deep concern for the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons. They welcomed plans by the United States to convene a High-Level Summit on Refugees in September 2016, recognizing the opportunity it affords to galvanize additional international support. Ahead of that Summit, the United States and GCC countries underscored the need to provide additional assistance for refugees.\nThe leaders encouraged additional Iraqi progress toward reducing sectarian tensions and promoting inclusive governance and reconciliation among all Iraqis, including by urgently addressing the legitimate grievances of all components of Iraqi society through the implementation of reforms. The leaders pledged to intensify support for Iraqi measures to put ISIL on a path to a lasting defeat. They called for intensified efforts to stabilize territory liberated from ISIL and deliver additional aid to Iraq's refugees and IDPs. The leaders welcomed the cessation of hostilities in Yemen, pledged to support it, and urged all Yemeni parties to also abide by it. They expressed continued strong support for U.N. envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed's work and emphasized the importance of achieving progress in talks convening in Kuwait. They urged all parties to make the difficult decisions necessary to achieve a durable, inclusive political settlement of the conflict, according to the terms of UNSCR 2216 (2015), GCC Initiative, and Yemen's National Dialogue Outcomes. Acknowledging the tremendous human pain and suffering of the Yemeni people, GCC leaders pledged to further facilitate the unimpeded, timely delivery of humanitarian assistance, food, medicine, fuel, and commercial goods to all of Yemen, as rapidly as possible. They also undertook to support the long-term reconstruction of Yemen, including through its economic integration with the GCC economies.\nRegarding Libya, leaders welcomed the recent seating of the Government of National Accord in Tripoli. They expressed the strong view that all Libyans throughout the country must overcome attempted obstructions by spoilers, respect the Government's authority and legitimacy, and embrace this important opportunity for a peaceful and more prosperous future. The GCC and United States called on the international community to assist the Government of National Accord's work addressing the challenges facing Libya, including the grave threat posed by ISIL.\nThe GCC countries and United States also underscored the necessity of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the basis of a just, lasting, comprehensive peace agreement that results in a sovereign and contiguous Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel. Toward that end, the leaders reaffirmed the enduring importance of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative and determined to remain closely coordinated on efforts to encourage the parties to demonstrate—through policies and actions—their commitment to a two-state solution.\nDefeating ISIL and al-Qa'ida\nUnderscoring their shared commitment to defeat terrorism in all of its forms, both the GCC and United States welcomed progress reversing ISIL's territorial gains in Iraq and Syria. The United States welcomed GCC members' participation in and support for the international Counter-ISIL coalition and commended the rigorous efforts by GCC member states to prevent terrorist attacks, including by bolstering information sharing on foreign terrorist fighters, as well as actions by Gulf partners to counter ISIL's hateful ideology and message, and more broadly to counter violent extremism. Expressing concern at attempts by al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIL to take advantage of the vacuum of authority in Yemen, they emphasized the importance of actions to counter this threat in parallel with progress reaching a political settlement of the conflict. Leaders received an update on the recently-formed Islamic Counterterrorism Coalition, and pledged to further strengthen their counterterrorism partnership.\nIran and Regional Stability\nThe United States and the GCC states reiterated support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran, noting that successful implementation of the JCPOA, thus far, has blocked Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon and enhanced regional security and stability. Leaders reaffirmed the need to remain vigilant about addressing Iran's destabilizing actions in the region, including its ballistic missile program and support for terrorist groups such as Hizballah and other extremist proxies, in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, and elsewhere. To help inform a shared approach to those activities, the GCC and the United States pledged to increase information sharing on Iran and other asymmetric threats in the region. GCC countries also committed to redouble their engagement on U.S. offers of maritime security cooperation, and to expeditiously reach consensus on steps necessary to implement an integrated ballistic missile defense early warning system. The United States and the GCC stressed the need for broader dialogue to resolve the region's conflicts, as well as their shared interest in reducing sectarian tensions. GCC countries reaffirmed their willingness to build trust and resolve longstanding differences through engagement with Iran; it being understood that Iran must engage the region according to the principles of good neighborliness, strict non-interference in domestic affairs, and respect for territorial integrity, consistent with international law, including the United Nations Charter.\nStrengthening GCC Capacity to Address External and Internal Threats\nThe United States policy to use all elements of power to secure its core interests in the Gulf region, and to deter and confront external aggression against its allies and partners, as it did during the Gulf War, is unequivocal. The United States remains prepared to work jointly with the GCC states to deter and confront an external threat to any GCC state's territorial integrity that is inconsistent with the U.N. charter. GCC leaders, in turn, committed to strengthening their engagement on U.S. offers of security assistance, cooperation, and training aimed at enhancing the Gulf states' ability to play a larger role in addressing regional challenges.\nLeaders were briefed on the April 20 meeting of U.S. and GCC defense ministers. Validating the importance of GCC-U.S. training exercises, they announced that GCC countries and the United States would immediately begin planning for a combined military exercise in March 2017, to showcase the full breath of GCC-U.S. security capabilities. GCC countries endorsed quick implementation of a new initiative to train specially-designated Special Operations Forces (SOF) units from each GCC country, in order to bolster interoperable counterterrorism capabilities. GCC countries also supported expanded cooperation on cyber security, endorsing peacetime cyber norms codified by Saudi Arabia, the United States, and other G-20 countries.\nThe U.S. expressed its readiness to support GCC efforts to diversify their economies, provide more effective governance, and adapt to economic challenges posed by low oil prices and changing demographics. Toward that end, GCC countries endorsed a U.S. proposal to inaugurate a ministerial-level GCC-U.S. economic dialogue in 2016, to supplement the activities undertaken under the GCC-U.S. Framework Agreement on Economic, Trade, Investment and Technical Cooperation of 2012. In addition to strengthening GCC-U.S. economic and investment ties, this dialogue would seek to assist GCC countries' implementation of economic and energy policies aimed at making available additional resources to meet their development needs. Leaders reaffirmed the mutual benefits of cooperation on climate issues, and committed to work toward the adoption of an amendment to the Montreal Protocol in 2016 to phasedown hydrofluorocarbons.\nAn Enduring Partnership\nLeaders committed to continue coordinating closely on issues of mutual concern, including through meetings of GCC and U.S. foreign and defense ministers, and support for an annual leader-level Summit. The United States welcomed GCC interest in opening an office in Washington to advance cooperation, and will support efforts toward that end. Leaders also directed that all U.S.-GCC working groups meet at least twice annually, to advance partnership on counterterrorism, streamlining the transfer of critical defense capabilities, missile defense, military preparedness, and cyber security. For continuity of those efforts, and speedy implementation of decisions expressed in the Camp David Joint Statement of May 14, 2015, its annex, and this communique, they directed their respective administrations to strengthen the framework of the GCC-U.S. partnership, including the Strategic Cooperation Forum.\nLeaders expressed satisfaction with and stressed the central importance of an enduring GCC-U.S. partnership as a means to promote peace, security and stability in the region.", "timestamp": "2016-04-21", "title": "Joint Statement—United States-Gulf Cooperation Council Second Summit Leaders Communique"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 4:16 p.m. in the First Floor Lunch Room at Diriyah Palace. In his remarks, he referred to President Bashar al-Asad of Syria; and President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization, also known as \"Daesh.\" A portion of these remarks could not be verified because the audio was incomplete.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117093", "text": "[The President's remarks were joined in progress.]\nThe President. ——the entire Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for their hospitality and their generosity and all my counterparts in the GCC who devoted the time and the energy to make sure that this was a successful summit.\nYou already heard my statement, so I'm going to take a couple of questions, starting with Kathleen Hennessey of AP. Where's Kathleen? Where are you? There you are.\nGulf Cooperation Council-U.S. Relations/Libya/Yemen/Iran/Iraq/Syria\nQ. Thanks for doing this, Mr. President. In the lead-up to this trip, there was a lot of talk about strains in the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, some of it stemming from your comments about Gulf partners being \"free riders\" and specifically that Iran and Saudi Arabia should \"share the neighborhood.\" I'm wondering if after your meeting you feel like you've eased any of those tensions, if that was the goal. And can you point to any evidence of greater cooperation or engagement in the campaign against ISIL? Do you feel now that the Gulf partners are carrying their weight?\nThe President. Well, I think that a lot of the strain was always overblown. The fact of the matter is, is that the friendship and cooperation that exist between the United States and the Gulf countries has been consistent for decades. During the course of our administration, the GCC countries have extensively cooperated with us on counterterrorism, on curbing the financing of terrorist activities. They are part of the ISIL—counter-ISIL coalition that has made progress both in Syria and in Iraq.\nIf you think about last year, when we had the Camp David meeting, you were already seeing the onset of conflict in Libya as well as in Yemen. And as we come to this meeting, in part because of the collective efforts of members of the GCC, we have a new Government in Libya that is very nascent, but has the opportunity finally to organize itself in a way that we haven't seen in a couple of years. That would not have happened had it not been for the effective diplomatic pressure that was applied by all the GCC countries, as well as the United States and the United Nations.\nIn Yemen, we now have a cessation of hostilities that allows us to build a peace process that can relieve the suffering of the people inside of Yemen. That would not have happened had it not been for the GCC-U.S. cooperation. We would not have gotten an Iran deal to get their nuclear weapons out had not the GCC been supportive of it.\nSo what is true between the United States and the GCC, as is true with all of our allies and friends, is that at any point in time, there are going to be differences in tactics. And part of the goal here, as well as the meeting at Camp David, is to make sure that not only do we share a broad common vision of how prosperity and stability and peace are achieved in this region and how we counter extremist activity, but that we have knowledge of what each party is doing on an ongoing basis. I think it is no doubt true that when we entered into the negotiations with Iran around the nuclear deal, there was concern that in the interest of getting the deal done, we would somehow look the other way with respect to their other destabilizing activities. And in fact, what we are able to report is not only have we seen Iran do what it was supposed to do under the deal and the threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon is greatly reduced, but what we've also seen, what the GCC has seen, is our continued cooperation in, for example, interdicting Iranian efforts to arm the Houthi militias inside of Yemen. That, I think, has created some confidence.\nBut one of the things, at a time when the region is so fraught with so many different problems and challenges, is the need for more consistent institutionalized communication at every level of government. And that's part of what we've been able to achieve through these two summits. And my hope is, is that it will continue into the next administration. I think it has been highly useful, because the possibilities of misunderstanding increase when there's so much activity taking place.\nI'll give you one last example. Inside of Iraq, there are understandable concerns about Iranian influence in the Iraqi Government at a time when the Iraqi Government is also critical for us fighting ISIL. It was very important, I think, for us to describe our assessment that Prime Minister Abadi is in fact effectively fighting against ISIL and trying to reach out to Sunnis inside of Iraq, while acknowledging that there are significant problems in terms of Government stability inside of Baghdad. And that's a reason for us not to withdraw, but rather to get more involved in helping to stabilize areas like Anbar, where we've not cleared out ISIL, but the towns that they were governing have been left devastated. And if we want Sunni communities to be able to rebuild themselves and to get back into the lives they were leading before ISIL took over, then we're going to have to help the Iraqi Government respond.\nThe same is true with respect to Syria. Right now the cessation of hostilities is very fragile and may be breaking down in part because of the Asad regime's continuing attacks on areas where they perceive they have an advantage. This is part of the reason why I called Mr. Putin on Monday, indicating to him that in the same way that we are continually urging moderate opposition inside of Syria to abide by the cessation of hostilities, he needs to be holding the regime into account.\nFor us to be able to describe the specifics of that conversation in a setting like this to give the opportunity for the other heads of state to ask questions about Russian intentions, I think, was extremely useful.\nIraq/Kuwait\nQ. Were you able to secure any new commitments on the stabilization effort? I mean, you were asking for aid. Did you get any?\nThe President. We've been able to secure additional commitments with respect to the counter-ISIL campaign more broadly. With respect to direct help to the Iraqi Government, what I recommended was that we wait to assess how the current Government turmoil in Iraq plays itself out over the next couple of weeks before we make final decisions about how useful particular offers of assistance will be. Although, already what we've seen is, for example, the Government of Kuwait over the last year has deferred payments that were required under the U.N. resolution between Iraq and Kuwait. That's worth a couple of billion dollars to the Iraqi Government. And we described our efforts to make sure that in addition to the military assistance we're providing Iraq, that we're also focusing on these stabilization functions. But frankly, right now in Baghdad, there's some big challenges in terms of Prime Minister Abadi forming a new Government—or a new Cabinet. Until that's settled, I think it's important for us to make sure that any additional stabilization dollars that are put in are going to be effectively spent.\nGreg Jaffe [Washington Post]. Go ahead, Greg.\nIraq/Syria\nQ. I was going to ask, since you just spoke about Prime Minister Abadi, how concerned are you about his hold on power? Are there things that the GCC partners can do to help solidify his government? And then, did you guys talk about a plan B in Syria if the cessation of hostilities falters? And then, lastly, I was just going to ask, have you contemplated adding additional special forces in Syria to bolster the counter-ISIL fight? And what might it take for you to make that decision?\nThe President. Good. On the first item, I'm concerned. I think Prime Minister Abadi has been a good partner for us. But interestingly enough, right now in Baghdad, the challenges within the Government don't fall along the usual lines of Kurdish-Sunni-Shia. There's actually significant dissension and disputes even among the Shia power blocks.\nObviously, ultimately, it's up to the Iraqis to make these decisions. It's not up to us, it's not up to the Iranians, it's not up to GCC countries. It's up to the Iraqi people to determine the Government that they form.\nWe do think, however, that it is vital for the health and stability of Iraq that the Cabinet and the makeup of Government is finalized and stabilized. And we've been urging them to get the job done. And we have contacts with all the various factions and parties, saying to them they have to take the long view and think about the well-being of the country at a time when they're still fighting Daesh, Mosul is still under ISIL control; at a time when, because of low oil prices, they've got challenges with respect to their budget. There's a dam that needs to be fixed. They've got a lot on their plate. Now is not the time for Government gridlock or bickering.\nWith respect to Syria, we had discussions about what options are available to us should the current cessation of hostilities break down. None of the options are good. It has been my view consistently that we have to get a political solution inside of Syria and that all the external actors involved have to be committed to that as well as the actors inside of Syria. Certainly, that's what the Syrian people want. They want an end to the bombing. They want to be able to go back to their homes. They want to be able to farm their lands and run their businesses and send their kids to school.\nAnd the problem with any plan B that does not involve a political settlement is that it means more fighting, potentially for years. And whoever comes out on top will be standing on top of a country that's been devastated and that will then take years to rebuild. So the sooner we can end fighting and resolve this in a political fashion, the better.\nThe primary reasons that we have been emphasizing the need for Asad to go is not just because he's killed his people and barrel bombed women and children, it's that it is hard to conceive of him being at the head of a Government that would end the fighting because it was perceived as legitimate. That's what we have to emphasize, that's what we have to work on. Okay?\nI'm going to take one last question. [At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.]\nQ. Arab press, Mr. President. A question from the Arab press, please.\nThe President. Go ahead. Here's—I assume this is Arab press, not just you. Go ahead, but there are other people who are——\nQ. [Inaudible]—from Al Saudia newspaper.\nThe President. I'm sorry, go ahead, please.\nQ. My name is—[inaudible]. I'm from Al Saudia newspaper.\nThe President. Yes, go ahead.\nGulf Cooperation Council-U.S. Relations/Iran\nQ. My question: What, Mr. President, do you think the main issue or case that you have a different opinion between GCC and the United States and this—something you think there is different?\nThe President. Yes, yes. Well, I think that, overall, there's a broad consensus in assisting each other in our collective security. The GCC hosts the United States, and we could not operate effectively militarily in the region if it weren't for GCC countries. Our intelligence sharing is vital in fighting against terrorism and has consistently improved.\nWe're starting to see the need to cooperate on new threats like cyber attacks, for example. Our efforts as a consequence of these summits to form a unified ballistic missile defense is very important. Our belief that the prosperity and stability of the region depends on countries treating all their citizens fairly and that sectarianism is an enemy of peace and prosperity: that if people are seeing themselves not as a citizen of a country, but as a member of a particular branch of Islam, that that is a recipe for countries falling apart. I think there's broad agreement there.\nProbably, the biggest area where there's been tactical differences has been with respect to Iran. And the issue is not the need for shared cooperation to deter against Iranian provocations. On that, we're all agreed. I think that there has been concern, even when we were working on the Iran nuclear deal, that if we were in discussions with them about these issues, that somehow, Iran would feel emboldened to act more provocatively in the region.\nAnd what I've said to them is, we have to have a dual track. We have to be effective in our defenses and hold Iran to account where it is acting in ways that are contrary to international rules and norms. But we also have to have the capacity to enter into a dialogue to reduce tensions and to identify ways in which the more reasonable forces inside of Iran can negotiate with the countries in the region, with its neighbors, so that we don't see an escalation of proxy fights across the region.\nAnd I think that that view is one that is consistent with how many in the GCC view it, but because there's been so much mistrust that's been built up—in part because of Iranian provocations—that people are cautious and want to make sure that nobody is naive about what Iran may be doing to stir up problems in other countries.\nAnd what we've consistently shown them is, we're not naive. But as I pointed out, during the height of the cold war, both Democratic Presidents like John F. Kennedy and Republican Presidents like Ronald Reagan still negotiated with the Soviet Union. Even when the Soviet Union was threatening the destruction of the United States, there was still dialogue so that we could find ways to reduce tensions and the dangers of war and chaos. And that's the same approach that we have to take. Even as Iran is calling us the \"Great Satan,\" we were able to get a deal done where they got rid of their nuclear stockpiles, and that makes us safer. That's not a sign of weakness, that's a sign of strength.\nOkay? Thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-04-21", "title": "Remarks During a Question-and-Answer Session With Reporters in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation was published in the  Federal Register  on April 26.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117123", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nOn April 22, 1970, millions of people from every corner of our country joined in common cause to demand basic protections to safeguard our planet for future generations. The first Earth Day helped transform the ways we interact with the world around us, and it changed how we view our impact on the natural world—inspiring the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and landmark legislation that protects the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the animals that live alongside us. Today, we resolve to build on the progress made in the nearly half-century since, and we reaffirm our commitment to leaving a clean, healthy Earth for our children and grandchildren.\nJust as the people who came together on Earth Day in 1970 embraced their responsibility to preserve our planet, today we face a threat that also requires collective action. Human activity is disrupting the climate, and the challenge of combating climate change is one that will define the contours of our time. The effects of climate change are already evident in stronger storms, deeper droughts, more rapidly eroding soil, and longer wildfire seasons—and as of last year, 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have occurred since 2000. This urgent threat will worsen with each passing year unless we act now.\nNo country can solve this challenge alone. This Earth Day, nations from across the globe are gathering in New York to sign an agreement reached by nearly 200 countries in Paris late last year that establishes an enduring framework to reduce global carbon pollution and set the world on a path to a low-carbon future. Under the Paris Agreement, countries pledge to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius at most, and to pursue efforts to keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Science tells us these levels will help prevent some of the most devastating impacts of climate change, including more frequent and extreme droughts, storms, fires, and floods, as well as catastrophic increases in sea level.\nThe Paris Agreement demonstrates what is possible when the world is united by a common concern and a shared purpose. The Agreement sets ambitious and specific targets for each nation that are necessary to solving the climate crisis. It applies to all countries, establishes meaningful accountability and reporting requirements, and brings countries back to the table every 5 years to grow their commitments as markets change and technologies improve. It also provides financing mechanisms so developing economies can move forward using clean energy, and it creates a collaborative process through which countries can establish and achieve their targets.\nKey to reaching the Paris Agreement was principled American leadership. Over the past decade, the United States has cut our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. We are committed to upholding our responsibility in the global effort to combat climate change and protect our planet, and my Administration has taken action to reduce our carbon pollution and lead the world in transitioning to a clean energy future. For example, we have made significant investments in clean energy—since I took Office, the amount of electricity generated from wind energy has tripled, and the amount generated from solar energy has increased more than thirtyfold. Last year, I announced the first set of nationwide standards to end the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from our country's power plants. To prepare for the impacts of climate change that we cannot prevent, we are working with States and cities to help communities build climate-resilient infrastructure. And I have protected more public lands and waters than any other President in history—more than 265 million acres.\nWe each have a role to play in ensuring that we do not pass a world beyond repair on to our children. Everyone must do their part, and as long as we unite to protect the one planet we have, we can leave it in better shape for future generations. On Earth Day, let us all accept our individual responsibilities to care for the world we live in, and let us marshal our best efforts toward building a safer, more stable, and more sustainable world.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22, 2016, as Earth Day. I encourage all Americans to participate in programs and activities that will protect our environment and contribute to a healthy, sustainable future.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-21", "title": "Proclamation 9426—Earth Day, 2016"}

Well, good afternoon, and welcome. It's great to welcome President Obama again, on his fifth visit to the United Kingdom.\nBarack has been President for more than 7 years; I've been Prime Minister for nearly 6 years. And our two countries have been working together through some of the most difficult and troubled global times. We faced the aftermath of the banking crisis, the need to revive growth and create jobs in our economies, new threats to our security from Russia in the east to the rise of Islamist terrorism in the south, and of course, huge global challenges like Ebola and climate change. And through it all, the strong and essential partnership between our nations has never been more important.\nWhen, 70 years ago last month, Winston Churchill first described the special relationship, it was not merely an enduring expression of friendship, it was a way of working together. It was about two nations, kindred spirits who share the same values and, so often, the same approaches to the many issues that we face.\nAnd just as for our predecessors, that has been true for Barack and me, whether we're working to deliver economic security, national security, or new, emerging challenges. And today we've been discussing all three.\nOn economic security, we've succeeded in getting our economies growing and creating jobs for our people. The global economy still faces serious challenges, but last year, Britain and the United States were the two fastest growing major economies in the world.\nAnd we both know just how important trade deals are in driving global growth. So Barack and I remain among the most determined to achieve our vision of a U.S.-EU trade deal. And we're working hard to push this forward because it would add billions to our economies and set the standards for the rest of the world to follow.\nOn national security, together with our partners in the EU, we've used our economic muscle to avoid the calamity of an Iranian nuclear weapon. We've delivered sanctions against Russia in response to its aggression against Ukraine. We've secured the first-ever global and legally binding deal on climate change, being formally signed today by over 150 governments at the United Nations.\nAnd we've transformed the way that we use our aid, our diplomacy, and our military together to make progress on some of the most difficult issues of our time. For example, in East Africa, we've helped to turn around the prospects for Somalia. For instance, thanks to an EU operation, led by Britain, supported by America, its waters are no longer a safe haven for pirates. And in West Africa, British leadership in Europe secured a billion euros to support our efforts in helping the people of the region to defeat the outbreak of Ebola, with Britain taking the lead in Sierra Leone, the United States in Liberia, France in Guinea.\nBut just as we've made important progress in all these areas, so there are many more that need a lot more work. There's no doubt that the situation in Libya is immensely challenging, but we now finally have a Government of National Accord with whom we can work, while in Syria and Iraq, we are continuing coalition efforts to defeat and degrade Daesh.\nMore than 25,000 Daesh fighters have now been killed, over 600 in the last month alone, with the total number of Daesh fighters now estimated to be at its lowest for about 2 years. The Iraqi security forces are steadily pushing Daesh out of its territory, this week almost entirely clearing them out of the town of Hit. And in Syria, our partners have liberated the large Kurdish areas in the northeast and cut off the main route between Raqqa and Mosul.\nWe also discussed efforts to deal with the migration crisis. This doesn't directly affect the United States, and in the U.K., we've maintained our borders, and we will continue to do so. But we both know the challenge this poses to our friends and our allies and to the continent of Europe. This is the sort of challenge that can only be tackled effectively through international cooperation. NATO is helping to reduce the number of migrants in the Eastern Mediterranean. And Barack and I have discussed how NATO might now contribute to the EU's efforts in the Central Mediterranean too.\nWe also need to do more to break the business model of the people smugglers, so, together with our EU partners and the Libyan Government, we'll look at whether there's more we can do to strength the Libyan Coast Guard. Barack and I will be discussing this further when we meet with the leaders of France, Germany, and Italy in Hannover on Monday. And this will be another opportunity to show that—how, working together, collectively, we can better protect ourselves from the threats that we face.\nWe also covered a number of new and emerging challenges where it will be more important than ever that we work together with our own international partners to identify problems and deal with them rapidly. Just as we've done with Ebola, we now need the same international cooperation on dealing with the Zika virus, on the challenge of antimicrobial resistance, on cybersecurity, and on tackling corruption.\nBritain is holding a big anticorruption summit here in London next month, which Secretary Kerry will attend. And Barack and I have talked today about some of the things we wanted to achieve. One of the biggest problems is that if you're a country that wants to take action against corruption you have to go all around the globe to lobby for help. So we'd like to see an international anticorruption coordination center to help law enforcement agencies and investigators work together right across different jurisdictions. And if we get international agreement on this next month, both Britain and America will help contribute to set it up.\nAll this work we have done together, and at the same time, I think we've got to know each other very well. I'm honored to have Barack as a friend. He's taught me the rules of basketball. He's beaten me at table tennis. [Laughter] I remember very fondly the barbecue we had in Number 10 Downing Street, serving service men and women who serve our countries and serve our countries together here in the United Kingdom. I've always found Barack someone who gives sage advice. He's a man with a very good heart, and been a very good friend, and always will be a good friend, I know, to the United Kingdom.\nLet me finish by saying this. In all the areas we've discussed today, our collective power and reach is amplified by Britain's membership of the European Union. Let me be clear. When it comes to the special relationship between our two countries, there's no greater enthusiast than me. I'm very proud to have the opportunity to be Prime Minister and to stand outside the White House, listening to this man, my friend, Barack, say that the special relationship between our countries has never been stronger. But I've never felt constrained in any way in strengthening this relationship by the fact that we're in the European Union.\nIn fact, quite the reverse. We deliver for our people through all the international groups that we're part of. We enhance our security through the membership of NATO. We further our prosperity through the G-7 and the G-20. And like those organizations, Britain's membership of the EU gives us a powerful tool to deliver on the prosperity and security that our people need and to stand up for the values that our countries share. And now, I think, is a time to stay true to those values and to stick together with our friends and allies in Europe and around the world.\nThank you very much.\nBarack.\nPresident Obama. Thank you, David. And as always, it is wonderful to be here in London and to meet with my good friend David Cameron. I confess I've also come back to wish Her Majesty the Queen a very happy 90th birthday. Earlier today Michelle and I had the honor to join Her Majesty and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh as their guests at Windsor Castle, where we conveyed the good wishes of the American people.\nI have to say, I have never been driven by a Duke of Edinburgh before. [Laughter] And I can report that it was very smooth riding. As for Her Majesty, the Queen has been a source of inspiration for me, like so many people around the world. She is truly one of my favorite people. And should we be fortunate enough to reach 90, may we be as vibrant as she is. She's an astonishing person and a real jewel to the world and not just to the United Kingdom.\nThe alliance between the United States and the United Kingdom is one of the oldest and one of the strongest that the world has ever known. When the U.S. and the U.K. stand together, we make our countries more secure, we make our people more prosperous, and we make the world safer and better.\nThat's one of the reasons why my first overseas visit as President more than 7 years ago was here to London, at a time of global crisis. And the one thing I knew, as green as I was as a new President, was that it was absolutely vital that the United States and the United Kingdom, working together in an international forum, tackle the challenges that lie ahead. Our success depended on our ability to coordinate and to be able to leverage our relationship to have an impact on other countries.\nI met with David on that visit. He wasn't yet Prime Minister. But just as our nations share a special relationship, David and I have shared an extraordinary partnership. He has proven to be a great friend and is one of my closest and most trusted partners. Over the 6 years or so that our terms have overlapped, we have met or spoken more times than I can count. We've shared our countries' beers with each other—he vouches for his, I vouch for mine—[laughter]—taken in a basketball game in America.\nDavid, I think you should recall, we were actually partners in that ping-pong game. [Laughter] And we lost to some schoolchildren.\nPrime Minister Cameron. Yes. [Laughter]\nPresident Obama. I can't remember whether they were 8 or 10, but they were decidedly shorter than we were, and they whooped us. [Laughter] Samantha and Michelle, our better halves, have become good friends as well. And it's the depth and the breadth of that special relationship that has helped us tackle some of the most daunting challenges of our time.\nAround the world, our joint efforts, as David mentioned, have stopped the outbreak of Ebola, helped Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, forged a climate agreement in Paris that, hopefully, will help to protect our planet for future generations.\nAnd today, on Earth Day, our governments, along with about 170 others, are in New York to sign that agreement. And the U.S. is committed to formally joining it this year, which should help it take effect years earlier than anybody expected.\nWe also discussed the full array of challenges to our shared security. We remain resolute in our efforts to prevent terrorist attacks against our people and to continue the progress that we've made in rolling back and ultimately defeating ISIL. Our forces, as David mentioned, are systematically degrading ISIL's finances and safe havens and removing its top leaders from the battlefield. And we've got to keep working to improve security and information sharing across Europe and to stem the flow of foreign fighters into and out of Syria.\nWe discussed our efforts to resolve political conflicts in the Middle East, from Yemen to Syria to Libya, in order to increase the prospects for stability. In Libya, going forward, we have an opportunity to support a new Government and help Libyans root out extremist elements. In Syria, as challenging as it is, we still need to see more progress towards an enduring cease-fire, and we continue to push for greater humanitarian access to the people who need it most.\nWe have to continue to invest in NATO so that we can meet our overseas commitments, from Afghanistan to the Aegean. We have to resolve the conflict in the Ukraine and reassure allies who are rightly concerned about Russian aggression. All NATO allies should aim for the NATO target of spending 2 percent of their GDP on defense, something that David has made sure happens here in the U.K. to meet that standard.\nWe discussed new actions we can take to address the refugee crisis, including with our NATO allies. And because a strong defense relies on more than just military spending, but on helping to unleash the potential of others to live freer and more prosperous lives, I want to thank the people of the United Kingdom for their extraordinary generosity as one of the world's foremost donors of humanitarian aid.\nWe talked about promoting jobs and stronger growth through increased transatlantic trade and investment so that our young people can achieve greater opportunity and prosperity. And yes, the Prime Minister and I discussed the upcoming referendum here on whether or not the U.K. should remain part of the European Union.\nLet me be clear: Ultimately, this is something that the British voters have to decide for themselves. But as part of our special relationship, part of being friends is to be honest and to let you know what I think. And speaking honestly, the outcome of that decision is a matter of deep interest to the United States because it affects our prospects as well. The United States wants a strong United Kingdom as a partner. And the United Kingdom is at its best when it's helping to lead a strong Europe. It leverages U.K. power to be part of the European Union.\nAs I wrote in the op-ed here today, I don't believe the EU moderates British influence in the world, it magnifies it. The EU has helped to spread British values and practices across the continent. The single market brings extraordinary economic benefits to the United Kingdom. And that ends up being good for America, because we're more prosperous when one of our best friends and closest allies has a strong, stable, growing economy. Americans want Britain's influence to grow, including within Europe.\nThe fact is, in today's world, no nation is immune to the challenges that David and I just discussed. And in today's world, solving them requires collective action. All of us cherish our sovereignty—my country is pretty vocal about that—but the U.S. also recognizes that we strengthen our security through our membership in NATO. We strengthen our prosperity through organizations like the G-7 and the G-20. And I believe the U.K. strengthens both our collective security and prosperity through the EU.\nIn the 21st century, the nations that make their presence felt on the world stage aren't the nations that go it alone, but the nations that team up to aggregate their power and multiply their influence. And precisely because Britain's values and institutions are so strong and so sound, we want to make sure that that influence is heard, that it's felt, that it influences how other countries think about critical issues. We have confidence that when the U.K. is involved in a problem that they're going to help solve it in the right way. That's why the United States cares about this.\nFor centuries, Europe was marked by war and by violence. The architecture that our two countries helped build with the EU has provided the foundation for decades of relative peace and prosperity on that continent. What a remarkable legacy, a legacy born in part out of what took place in this building.\nBefore we walked out, I happened to see Enigma on display. And that was a reminder of the incredible innovation and collaboration of the allies in World War II and the fact that neither of us could have won that alone. And in the same way, after World War II, we built out the international institutions that, yes, occasionally constrained us, but we willingly allowed those constraints because we understood that by doing so, we were able to institutionalize and internationalize the basic values of rule of law and freedom and democracy that would benefit our citizens as well as people around the world.\nI think there's a British poet who once said, \"No man is an island\"—[laughter]—even an island as beautiful as this. We're stronger together. And if we continue to tackle our challenges together, then future generations will look back on ours, just as we look back on the previous generation of English and American citizens who worked so hard to make this world safer and more secure and more prosperous, and they'll say that we did our part. And that's important. That's important not just here; that's important in the United States as well.\nThanks.\nPrime Minister Cameron. Thank you very much.\nRight, we've got some questions. We're going to start with a question from the British press. We'll have Chris Ship from ITV.\nUnited Kingdom's European Union Membership Referendum\nQ. Thank you very much, Prime Minister. Chris Ship from ITV News.\nMr. President, you, yourself, acknowledge the controversial timing of your comments on the EU referendum and the spirited debate that we're having here. And I think you're right. In the weeks before your arrival here, Leave campaigners have said that you're acting hypocritically. America would not accept the loss of sovereignty that we have to accept as part of the EU. America would not accept the levels of immigration from Mexico that we have to accept from the EU. And therefore, in various degrees of politeness, they have said to you that you should really keep your views to yourself. [Laughter] With that in mind, Mr. President, do you still think it was the right decision to intervene in this debate? And can I ask you this: Crucially, what happens if the U.K. does decide in June to leave the European Union?\nPresident Obama. Well, first of all, let me repeat: This is a decision for the people of the United Kingdom to make. I'm not coming here to fix any votes. I'm not casting a vote myself. I'm offering my opinion. And in democracies, you—everybody should want more information, not less. And you shouldn't be afraid to hear an argument being made. That's not a threat. That should enhance the debate.\nParticularly, because my understanding is that some of the folks on the other side have been ascribing to the United States certain actions we'll take if the U.K. does leave the EU. So they say, for example, that, well, we'll just cut our own trade deals with the United States. So they're voicing an opinion about what the United States is going to do. I figured you might want to hear it from the President of the United States what I think the United States is going to do. [Laughter]\nAnd on that matter, for example, I think it's fair to say that maybe some point down the line, there might be a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement, but it's not going to happen anytime soon, because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done, and the U.K. is going to be in the back of the queue, not because we don't have a special relationship, but because, given the heavy lift on any trade agreement, us having access to a big market with a lot of countries, rather than trying to do piecemeal trade agreements, is hugely inefficient.\nNow, to the subject at hand, obviously, the United States is in a different hemisphere, different circumstances, has different sets of relationships with its neighbors than the U.K. does. But I can tell you this. If right now I've got access to a massive market where I sell 44 percent of my exports, and now I'm thinking about leaving the organization that gives me access to that market and that is responsible for millions of jobs in my country and responsible for an enormous amount of commerce and upon which a lot of businesses depend, that's not something I'd probably do.\nAnd what I'm trying to describe is a broader principle, which is, in our own ways—I mean, we don't have a common market in the Americas—but in all sorts of ways, the United States constrains itself in order to bind everyone under a common set of norms and rules that makes everybody more prosperous.\nThat's what we built after World War II. The United States and the U.K. designed a set of institutions, whether it was the United Nations or the Bretton Woods structure, IMF, World Bank, NATO, across the board. Now, that, to some degree, constrained our freedom to operate. It meant that occasionally we had to deal with some bureaucracy. It meant that on occasion we have to persuade other countries and we don't get a hundred percent of what we want in each case. But we knew that by doing so, everybody was going to be better off, partly because the norms and rules that were put in place were reflective of what we believe. If there were more free markets around the world and an orderly financial system, we knew we could operate in that environment. If we had collective defense treaties through NATO, we understood that we could formalize an architecture that would deter aggression, rather than us having, piecemeal, to put together alliances to defeat aggression after it already started. And that principle is what's at stake here. And the last point I'll make on this—until I get the next question, I suspect—[laughter]—is that, as David said, this magnifies the power of the U.K. It doesn't diminish it. On just about every issue, what happens in Europe is going to have an impact here. And what happens in Europe is going to have an impact in the United States.\nWe just discussed, for example, the refugee and the migration crisis. And I've told my team—which is sitting right here, so they'll vouch for me—[laughter]—that we consider it a major national security issue that you have uncontrolled migration into Europe, not because these folks are coming to the United States, but because if it destabilizes Europe, our largest trading bloc—trading partner, it's going to be bad for our economy. If you start seeing divisions in Europe, that weakens NATO. That will have an impact on our collective security.\nNow, if in fact I want somebody who's smart and common sense and tough and is thinking, as I do, in the conversations about how migration is going to be handled, somebody who also has a sense of compassion and recognizes that immigration can enhance, when done properly, the assets of a country, and not just diminish them, well, I want David Cameron in the conversation. Just as I want him in the conversation when we're having conversations—discussions about information sharing and counterterrorism activity. There—precisely because I have confidence in the U.K., and I know that if we're not working effectively with Paris or Brussels, then those attacks are going to migrate to the United States and to London, I want one of my strongest partners in that conversation. So it enhances the special relationship. It doesn't diminish it.\nPrime Minister Cameron. Let me just make, Chris, one point in response to that. I mean, this is our choice, nobody else's; the sovereign choice of the British people. But as we make that choice, it surely makes sense to listen to what our friends think, to listen to their opinion, to listen to their views. And that's what Barack has been talking about today.\nBut it's also worth remembering as we make this choice, it's a British choice about the British membership of the European Union. We're not being asked to make a choice about whether we support the German style of membership or the Italian style of membership. Britain has a special status in the European Union. We're in the single market; we're not part of the single currency. We're able to travel and live and work in other European countries, but we've maintained our borders, because we're not in the Schengen no-border zone.\nAnd on this vital issue of trade, where Barack has made such a clear statement, we should remember why we are currently negotiating this biggest trade deal in the whole world and in the whole world's history, between the European Union and the United States. It's because Britain played an absolutely leading part in pushing for those talks to get going. Indeed, we announced them at the G-8 in Northern Ireland, when Britain was in the chair of that organization. We set the agenda for what could be an absolutely game-changing trade deal for jobs, for investment, because we were part of this organization.\nSo I just want to add those important points.\nI think we have a U.S. question now.\nPresident Obama. Justin Sink [Bloomberg News].\nEuropean Migration Crisis/United Kingdom's European Union Membership Referendum/Libya\nQ. Thanks, Mr. President. Following on that, do you think that between Brexit and the migration issue, European unity is at a crisis point? What do you hope leaders gathering in Germany can concretely do about it? And do you expect those nations to militarily support, including the possibility of ground troops, the new Government in Libya to keep that situation from further straining Europe? While we're talking about future summits, I'm also wondering if maybe you could talk about whether you plan to go to Hiroshima when you visit Japan. And——\nPresident Obama. Oh, come on, man. You're really stretching it. [Laughter]\nQ. This one is for Prime Minister Cameron, and it's short. I promise.\nPrime Minister Cameron, the President has come here to tell the U.K. that, as a friend, and speaking honestly, that they should stay in the EU. As a friend and speaking honestly, what would you advise American voters to do about Donald Trump? Thanks. [Laughter]\nPresident Obama. That was so predictable.\nPrime Minister Cameron. I'll let you take the first six——\nPresident Obama. Yes, exactly.\nPrime Minister Cameron. ——and then, I'll pick up that last one. [Laughter]\nPresident Obama. I wouldn't describe European unity as in a crisis, but I would say it is under strain. And some of that just has to do with the aftermath of the financial crisis and the strains that we're all aware of with respect to the euro zone. I think it is important to emphasize, as David points out, that the U.K. is not part of the euro zone, and so the blowback to the British economy has been different than it is on the continent. But we've seen some divisions and difficulties between the southern and the northern parts of Europe. That's created some strains.\nI think the migration crisis amplifies a debate that's taking place not just in Europe, but in the United States as well. At a time of globalization, at a time when a lot of the challenges that we face are transnational, as opposed to just focused on one country, there is a temptation to want to just pull up the drawbridge, either literally or figuratively. We see that played out in some of the debates that are taking place in the U.S. Presidential race. And that debate, I think, is accelerated in Europe. But I'm confident that the ties that bind Europe together are ultimately much stronger than the forces that are trying to pull them apart.\nEurope has undergone an extraordinary stretch of prosperity, maybe unmatched in the history of the world. And if you think about the 20th century and you think about the 21st century, 21st-century Europe looks an awful lot better. And I think the majority of Europeans recognize that. They see that unity and peace have delivered sustained economic growth, reduced conflict, reduced violence, enhanced the quality of life of people. And I'm confident that can continue.\nBut I do believe that it's important to watch out for some of these faultlines that are developing. And in that sense, I do think that the Brexit vote—which, if I'm a citizen of U.K., I'm thinking about it solely in terms of how is this helping me, how is this helping the U.K. economy, how is it helping create jobs here in the U.K.—that's the right way to think about it. But I do also think that this vote will send a signal that is relevant about whether the kind of prosperity that we've built together is going to continue or whether the forces of division end up being more prominent. And that's why it's—that's part of the reason why it's relevant to the United States and why I have had the temerity to weigh in on it. What were your four other questions? [Laughter] I've got to figure I've knocked out two through that answer.\nQ. Libya.\nPresident Obama. With respect to Libya, both David and I discussed our commitment to try to assist this nascent Government. And it's a challenge, but there are people in this Government of National Accord that are genuinely committed to building back up a state. That's something we desperately want, because both the United States and United Kingdom, but also a number of our other allies, are more than prepared to invest in helping create border security in Libya and helping to drive out terrorists inside of Libya and trying to make sure that what could be a thriving society—a relatively small population, a lot of resources—this is not an issue where we should have to subsidize Libya. They're actually much better positioned than some other countries that we've been helping, if they can just get their act together. And we want to help provide that technical assistance to get that done.\nThere is no plans for ground troops in Libya. I don't think that's necessary. I don't think it would be welcomed by this new Government. It would send the wrong signal. This is a matter of, can Libyans come together? What we can do is to provide them our expertise. What we can do is provide them training. What we can do is provide them a roadmap for how they can get basic services to their citizens and build up legitimacy.\nBut I do think that the one area where both David and I are heavily committed is, as this progresses, we can't wait if ISIL is starting to get a foothold there. And so we are working not just with the Libyan Government, but a lot of our international partners, to make sure that we're getting the intelligence that we need and, in some cases, taking actions to prevent ISIL from having another stronghold from which to launch attacks against Europe or against the United States.\nAnd I think you have to wait until I get to Asia to start asking me Asia questions. [Laughter]\nPrime Minister Cameron. The question you asked me: This is not a general election. This is a referendum. And as Barack has explained, it's a referendum that affects, of course, the people of the United Kingdom very deeply, but it also does affect others in the European Union; it affects partners like America or Canada or Australia or New Zealand. And as I look around the world, it is hard to find—so far, I haven't found one—a country that wishes Britain well that thinks we ought to leave the European Union.\nAnd I think that's—again, it's our choice. We'll make the decision. We'll listen to all the arguments. People want the facts. They want the arguments. They want to know the consequences. And I'll try to lay those out as Prime Minister as clearly as I can. But listening to our friends, listening to countries that wish us well, is part of the process and is a good thing to do.\nAs for the American elections, I've made some comments in recent weeks and months. I don't think now is a moment to add to them or subtract from them. [Laughter] But I think, Justin, as a Prime Minister who's been through two general elections leading my party, you always look on at the U.S. elections in awe of the scale of the process and the length of the process, and I marvel at anyone who is left standing at the end of it. [Laughter]\nPresident Obama. Fortunately, we're term limited. [Laughter] So I, too, can look in awe at the process. [Laughter] Prime Minister Cameron. We have another British question from Laura Kuenssberg from the BBC.\nWhite House Bust of Former Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom/United Kingdom-U.S. Relations/United Kingdom's European Union Membership Referendum\nQ. Thank you. Mr. President, you've made your views very plain on the fact that British voters should choose to stay in the EU. But in the interest of good friends always being honest, are you also saying that our decades-old special relationship that's been through so much would be fundamentally damaged and changed by our exit? If so, how? And are you also—do you have any sympathy with people who think this is none of your business?\nAnd, Prime Minister, to you, if I may, some of your colleagues believe it's utterly wrong that you have dragged our closest ally into the EU referendum campaign. What do you say to them? And is it appropriate for the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, to have brought up President Obama's Kenyan ancestry in the context of this debate?\nPrime Minister Cameron. Well, let me—this is a British question, let me go first. I mean, first of all, questions for Boris are questions for Boris are questions for Boris, they're not questions for me.\nI don't have some special power over the President of the United States. Barack feels strongly about this and has said what he's said. And as I said, it's our decision as a sovereign people, the choice we make about Europe, but I think it's right to listen to and consider the advice of your friends.\nAnd just to amplify one of the points that Barack made, we have a shared interest of making sure Europe takes a robust approach to Russian aggression. And if you take those issues of the sanctions that we put in place through the European Union, I think I can put my hand on my heart and say that Britain played a really important role, and continues to play an important role, in making sure those sanctions were put in place and kept in place. I'm not sure it would have happened if we weren't there.\nNow, if it's in our interests—and it is in our interest for Europe to be strong against aggression—how can it be in our interests not to be at that table and potentially to see those sanctions not take place? And I think it's been that working between Britain and the United States over this issue that has helped to make a big difference.\nI would just say about the special relationship, to me—and I'm passionate about this, and I believe it very, very deeply, for all the reasons of the history and the language and the culture, but also about the future of our country—and the truth is this: The stronger Britain is, and the stronger America is, the stronger that relationship will be. And I want Britain to be as strong as possible. And we draw our strength from all sorts of things that we have as a country: the fifth largest economy in the world; amazing Armed Forces, brilliant security and intelligence forces, that we were discussing about how well they work together; incredibly talented people; brilliant universities; the fact that we're members of NATO, the G-7, the G-20, the Commonwealth. But we also draw strength and project strength and project power and project our values and protect our people and make our country wealthier and our people wealthier by being in the European Union.\nSo I want Britain to be as strong as possible. And the stronger Britain is, the stronger that special relationship is, and the more that we can get done together to make sure that we have a world that promotes democracy and peace and human rights and the development that we want to see across the world.\nSo to me, it's simple: Stronger Britain, stronger special relationship—that's in our interests, and that's in the interests of the United States of America as well.\nPresident Obama. Let me start with Winston Churchill. [Laughter] You know, I don't know if people are aware of this, but in the Residence, on the second floor, my office, my private office is called the Treaty Room. And right outside the door of the Treaty Room, so that I see it every day—including on weekends, when I'm going into that office to watch a basketball game—[laughter]—the primary image I see is a bust of Winston Churchill. It's there voluntarily, because I can do anything on the second floor. [Laughter] I love Winston Churchill. I love the guy. [Laughter]\nNow, when I was elected as President of the United States, my predecessor had kept a Churchill bust in the Oval Office. There are only so many tables where you can put busts; otherwise, it starts looking a little cluttered. [Laughter] And I thought it was appropriate, and I suspect most people here in the United Kingdom might agree, that as the first African American President, it might be appropriate to have a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King in my office to remind me of all the hard work of a lot of people who would somehow allow me to have the privilege of holding this office. That's just on Winston Churchill. I think people should know that, know my thinking there.\nWith respect to the special relationship, I have a staff member, who will not be named—because it might embarrass her a little bit—who, generally, on foreign trips, does not leave the hotel or the staff room because she's constantly doing work making this happen. She has had one request the entire time that I have been President, and that is, could she accompany me to Windsor on the off chance that she might get a peek at Her Majesty the Queen. And, gracious as she is, Her Majesty actually had this person, along with a couple of others, lined up so that as we emerged from lunch, they could say hello. And this staff person, who is as tough as they come, almost fainted and—[laughter]—which was—I'm glad she didn't because it would have caused an incident. [Laughter] That's the special relationship.\nWe are so bound together that nothing is going to impact the emotional and cultural and intellectual affinities between our two countries. So I don't come here suggesting in any way that that is impacted by a decision that the people of the United Kingdom may make around whether or not they're members of the European Union. That is there. That's solid. And that will continue, hopefully, eternally. And the cooperation in all sorts of ways—through NATO, through G-7, G-20—all those things will continue.\nBut, as David said, if one of our best friends is in an organization that enhances their influence and enhances their power and enhances their economy, then I want them to stay in it. Or at least I want to be able to tell them, you know, I think this makes you guys bigger players. I think this helps your economy. I think this helps to create jobs.\nAnd so, ultimately, it's your decision. But precisely because we're bound at the hip, I want you to know that before you make your decision.\nMargaret Brennan [CBS News].\nUnited Kingdom-U.S. Travel/Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights in the U.S./Syria/Death of Musician Prince R. Nelson Q. Thank you very much, sir. Mr. President, Vladimir Putin hasn't stopped Asad, as he led you to believe he would, and the cease-fire in Syria appears to be falling apart. Will you continue to bet on what looks to be a losing strategy?\nMr. Prime Minister, the U.K. today warned its citizens traveling to North Carolina and Mississippi about laws there that affect transgender individuals. As a friend, what do you think of those laws?\nMr. President, would you like to weigh in on that? And, sir, if you'd indulge us——\nPresident Obama. Indulge—what do you mean?\nQ. Well, indulge all of us back in the U.S., sir. Prince passed away. You were a fan. You had invited him to perform at the White House. Can you tell us what made you a fan?\nPresident Obama. I'm trying to figure out which order to do this. [Laughter] Maybe I'll start with North Carolina and Mississippi. I want everybody here in the United Kingdom to know that the people of North Carolina and Mississippi are wonderful people. They are hospitable people. They are beautiful States, and you are welcome and you should come and enjoy yourselves. And I think you'll be treated with extraordinary hospitality.\nI also think that the laws that have been passed there are wrong and should be overturned. And they're in response to politics, in part; in part, some strong emotions that are generated by people, some of whom are good people, but I just disagree with when it comes to respecting the equal rights of all people, regardless of sexual orientation, whether they're transgender or gay or lesbian. And although I respect their different viewpoints, I think it's very important for us not to send signals that anybody is treated differently.\nAnd I think it's fair to say that we're not unique among countries where—particularly under a federal system in which power is dispersed, that there are going to be some localities or local officials that put forward laws that aren't necessarily reflective of a national consensus. But if you guys come to North Carolina or Mississippi, everybody will be treated well.\nThe second question with respect to Syria, I am deeply concerned about the cessation of hostilities fraying and whether it's sustainable. Now, keep in mind that I have always been skeptical about Mr. Putin's actions and motives inside of Syria. He is—along with Iran—the preeminent backer of a murderous regime that I do not believe can regain legitimacy within his country because he's murdered a lot of people.\nHaving said that, what I also believe is, is that we cannot end the crisis in Syria without political negotiations and without getting all the parties around the table to craft a transition plan. And that, by necessity, means that there are going to be some people on one side of the table who I deeply disagree with and whose actions I deeply abhor. That's how oftentimes you resolve conflicts like this that are taking an enormous toll on the Syrian people.\nThe cessation of hostilities actually held longer than I expected. And for 7 weeks, we've seen a significant reduction in violence inside that country. And that gave some relief to people.\nI talked to Putin on Monday precisely to reinforce to him the importance of us trying to maintain the cessation of hostilities, asking him to put more pressure on Asad, indicating to him that we would continue to try to get the moderate opposition to stay at the negotiating table in Geneva. But this has always been hard. And it's going to keep being hard. And what David and I discussed in our meeting was that we will continue to prosecute the war against Daesh, against ISIL. We are going to continue to support those who are prepared to fight ISIL. And we're going to continue to target them. We're going to continue to make progress. But we're not going to solve the overall problem unless we can get this political track moving.\nI assure you that we have looked at all options. None of them are great. And so we are going to play this option out. If in fact the cessation falls apart, we'll try to put it back together again even as we continue to go after ISIL. And it is in my belief—it's my belief that ultimately Russia will recognize that, just as this can't be solved by a military victory on the part of those we support, Russia may be able to keep the lid on, alongside Iran, for a while, but if you don't have a legitimate Government there, they will be bled as well. And that is not—that's not speculation on my part. I think the evidence all points in that direction.\nAnd finally, with respect to Prince, I loved Prince because he put out great music and he was a great performer. I didn't know him well. He came to perform at the White House last year and was extraordinary and creative and original and full of energy. And so it's a remarkable loss.\nAnd I'm staying at Winfield House, the U.S. Ambassador's residence. It so happens our Ambassador has a turntable, and so this morning we played \"Purple Rain\" and \"Delirious\" just to get warmed up—[laughter]—before we left the house for important bilateral meetings like this. [Laughter]\nPrime Minister Cameron. As a fan of great music, the Ambassador has brought a lot of brilliant talent.\nPresident Obama. Absolutely.\nPrime Minister Cameron. Let me just answer: I've been to North Carolina many years ago and enjoyed it. I have not yet made it to Mississippi, but one day I hope to. The guidance that we put out, the Foreign Office, gives advice on travel, and it obviously deals with laws in situations as they are, and it tries to give that advice dispassionately, impartially. But it's very important that it does so. And it's something that a lot of attention is given to.\nOur view on any of these things is that we believe that we should be trying to use law to end discrimination rather than to embed it or enhance it. And that's something we're comfortable saying to countries and friends anywhere in the world. But obviously, the laws people pass is a matter for their own legislatures. But we make clear our own views about the importance of trying to end discrimination, and we've made some important steps forward in our own country on that front, which we're proud of.\nWith that——\nPresident Obama. All good?\nPrime Minister Cameron. Thank you very much.\nPresident Obama. Thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-04-22", "title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister David W.D. Cameron of the United Kingdom in London, England"}

One such individual was U.S. Ambassador Henry Morgenthau, Sr., who voiced alarm both within the U.S. Government and with Ottoman leaders in an attempt to halt the violence. Voices like Morgenthau's continue to be essential to the mission of atrocity prevention, and his legacy shaped the later work of human rights champions such as Raphael Lemkin, who helped bring about the first United Nations human rights treaty.\nThis is also a moment to acknowledge the remarkable resiliency of the Armenian people and their tremendous contributions both to the international community as well as to American society. We recall the thousands of Armenian refugees who decades ago began new lives in the United States, forming a community that has enormously advanced the vitality of this Nation and risen to prominence and distinction across a wide range of endeavors. At a moment of regional turmoil to Armenia's south, we also thank the people of Armenia for opening their arms to Syrian refugees, welcoming nearly 17,000 into their country.\nAs we look from the past to the future, we continue to underscore the importance of historical remembrance as a tool of prevention, as we call for a full, frank, and just acknowledgment of the facts, which would serve the interests of all concerned. I have consistently stated my own view of what occurred in 1915, and my view has not changed. I have also seen that peoples and nations grow stronger and build a foundation for a more just and tolerant future by acknowledging and reckoning with painful elements of the past. We continue to welcome the expression of views by those who have sought to shed new light into the darkness of the past, from Turkish and Armenian historians to Pope Francis.\nToday we stand with the Armenian people throughout the world in recalling the horror of the Meds Yeghern and reaffirm our ongoing commitment to a democratic, peaceful, and prosperous Armenia.", "timestamp": "2016-04-22", "title": "Statement on Armenian Remembrance Day"}

Led by a prophet and chased by an army, sustained by a faith in God, and rewarded with deliverance, the Israelites' journey from bondage to the Promised Land remains one of history's greatest examples of emancipation.

We will join millions around the world to celebrate redemption at God's mighty hand and pray for those who still are denied their freedom. We dip the greens of renewal in saltwater to recall the tears of those imprisoned unjustly.

You all good? (Applause.) All right, enough about me. This is about you. (Applause.)\nLet me start by thanking Dr. Meyers for that wonderful introduction, and more importantly, for her leadership of this fine university.\nI also want to thank Mayor Yarber, Representative Thompson, and all of the elected officials and members of Congress who are here with us today, as well as Mr. Perry, all of the trustees -- Dr. Blaine, Reverend Rhodes, of course, all of the faculty and staff here at Jackson State. Let's just take a moment to give it up to the people who helped get you here. (Applause.) Thank you all for your incredible hospitality. I wouldn't be anywhere else but here. I may be a little jetlagged, but I'm here, right now, to celebrate all of you. (Applause.) So I'm grateful.\nI also have to thank the symphonic band and both of the choirs today for that beautiful music. You all are amazing. (Applause.) And of course, before we go way in, we have to give it up to all the folks in the stands who helped you all get here –- the moms and dads, brothers, sisters, grandparents, cousins, friends, and neighbors -- all of you all -- let's give it up! (Applause.) Give it up!\nAnd finally, most of all, I want to join in congratulating\n-- oh, what a good-looking group -- the men and women of the Jackson State University Class of 2016! (Applause.) Woo! You all deserve all of that more, because I know how hard you worked to make it to this day, studying late into the night, writing and rewriting those papers, taking all those exams. Oh, my lord.\nBut I also heard that you have been able to have some fun over these past years, as well -– hanging out Gibbs-Green Plaza, turning up on Hot Spot Fridays at the Horseshoe. (Applause.) Don't get too excited -- mom and dad are in the stands. (Laughter.) Gearing up for Homecoming and Tiger Fest, \"rocking the house\" with one of the best bands in the country, the Sonic Boom of the South. (Applause.) Together, you all are the \"Superb Sixteen\" -– as I hear you call yourselves. (Applause.) And you're about to join a storied legacy from this university, a school that began as a tiny Baptist seminary, just 20 students strong -- just 20 students. But today has a legacy that reaches across the country and this state and right here into this very stadium.\nAnd that's actually where I'd like to start my remarks today, with this storied stadium and its place in our nation's history. Now, back in 1950, when this stadium was built, it was one of the finest stadiums in the country, quickly became the pride of Mississippi. But the story of this beautiful complex also has a darker side. For years, it stood as a steel and concrete tribute to segregation, because Jim Crow laws meant that only white teams and fans were allowed through these gates.\nBack in 1962, during an Ole Miss football game, this stadium became the site of what was essentially a pro-Jim Crow rally, with fans waving Confederate flags and singing a song called \"Never No Never\" to protest the admission of an African American student to their university. By halftime, they'd convinced the governor to even speak. He said just three sentences. He said, \"I love Mississippi. I love her people, our customs. I love and respect our heritage.\" And the crowd went wild, because they knew exactly what he meant.\nThat game was just one small moment in a struggle of civil rights that enflamed this entire country, but often burned hottest right here in Mississippi, the state where a 14-year-old boy named Emmett Till was beaten and murdered. Where NAACP leader Medgar Evers was assassinated. Where Freedom Riders overflowed the jails. Where gunshots would ring out here on your campus, killing young people and littering one of your dorms with bullet holes still seen today.\nIt was against that backdrop that one day in October of 1967, something truly extraordinary happened in this stadium. For years, legal and political pressure had been mounting for the state to desegregate. And that fall, the state finally announced that for the first time, two black teams would get to play in this stadium. Those teams were Grambling State and, of course, your own Jackson State Tigers. (Applause.)\nNow, just think for a moment. You can only imagine the pressure those teams and their fans were feeling. For so long, this field had been the pride of white –- and white only -– Mississippi, and now, black fans would fill these stands. Black coaches would patrol these sidelines. Black players would sweat and bleed on this field. How would the world respond? Would those forces of segregation rise up in protest, or worse? As one of the players at the time said –- this is a quote -- he said, \"There was certainly potential for it to become a very ugly situation.\"\nSo the Jackson State coach at the time, Coach Paige, thought hard about how to prepare his team. He sat his players down and told them to stay focused on two goals. The first: Beat Grambling State, of course, one of the best teams in the country. The second: He said, rise above the fray and set a good example, he said, because the whole state, the whole country would be watching.\nSo the players made sure their shoes were shined, their laces tied. They took special pains not to accidentally break anything in the locker room or walk out with a towel. Because as that player said -- and these are his words -- he said, \"We all wanted to be representatives of our families, our hometowns, our communities.\" \"We wanted to take care of that stadium as much as we could so it would be there for the next black team.\"\nAnd then they went out and they played their hearts out. And Jackson State won that game, giving Grambling its only loss of the season. But more importantly, the world saw what would happen when black folks came into this stadium. What did they see? They saw people enjoying a football game. They saw the same kind of skill and sportsmanship and strategy as any other game this stadium had hosted before.\nSo by simply showing and displaying sportsmanship, those players and coaches and fans joined the long line of heroes who made history in this country -- in our schoolhouses, our department stores, our lunch counters and everywhere else -- all of them using that same time-tested approach that has always moved this country forward. They didn't stoop to the level of those who sought to oppress them. Just the opposite: They rose up; they combatted small-mindedness with dignity, integrity, and excellence.\nThat is the well-worn path to Dr. King's mountaintop that so many men and women before us have taken -– famous civil rights leaders and ordinary folks who faced down dogs, and batons, and firehoses with prayer and hope and steadfast determination. For as Dr. King told us, he said, \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\"\nAnd, graduates, I'm here today to tell you that that approach to life isn't just something you should read about in the history books. It's a road map for how to live your lives every single day. And how do I know? Because I've seen the power of that approach up close and personal.\nSee, when I hear words like dignity and excellence, I think about my husband. (Applause.) See, I know I'm biased -- and I do think he's cute, too. (Applause.) But as I've walked this journey with Barack, I've gotten a pretty good look at what it means to rise above the fray, what it means to set your eyes on the horizon, to devote your life to making things better for those who will come after you. I have seen how, no matter what kind of ugliness is going on at any particular moment, Barack always stays the course. (Applause.)\nSee, I've watched him stay up late night after night, reading and writing and wrestling with the impossible decisions that a President is forced to make. I've been inspired by his tireless effort to engage people of all backgrounds –- respectfully listening to folks who disagree with him, bringing folks together to solve our common problems.\nAnd week after week, I see him read the letters he gets from people across this country -– and let me tell you, he writes back because he knows that they are who he serves. I see him dedicating himself to helping folks on the margins, folks who often don't have a voice. That is the work of his life, from his days as a community organizer in Chicago to his time in the White House today. And we all know that that empathy, that preparation, that moral compass, that relentless work ethic have led to so much progress over the past seven years.\nWe've gone from the brink of another Great Depression in this country to our businesses creating more than 14 million new jobs. Our unemployment rate has been cut in half. Our deficits are down by two-thirds. Our high school graduation rates are the highest on record. Over 20 million more people now have health insurance. And people in this country are finally free to marry the person they love. And on the global stage, the vast majority of our troops are home today. And our country isn't putting our heads in the sand on climate change –- no, we are leading the way to stop it. (Applause.)\nI could go on and on. But that's the progress we've seen under this President. That's the kind of change we all hoped was possible eight years ago. Yet, too often, instead of acknowledging or celebrating this change, we have a tendency to focus on conflict and controversy. We pay endless attention to folks who are blocking action, blocking judges, blocking immigration, blocking a raise in the minimum wage. Just blocking. We are consumed with the anger and vitriol that are bubbling up, with folks shouting at each other, using hateful and divisive language.\nAnd then there's the countless times when that language gets personal and is directed at my husband –- charges that he doesn't love our country. The time he was called a liar in front of a Joint Session of Congress. The nonstop questions about his birth certificate and his belief in God.\nNow, I know, I know that politics has always been a rough sport. I also know that well-meaning folks can get heated in the midst of contentious debates. And in light of today's 24-hour news cycle, in this era where our Facebook feeds are limited to the voices of folks who think exactly like we do and our TVs and radios are exclusively tuned in to those who tell us only what we want to hear, it's not surprising that our disagreements have become more personal, more intense. It's not surprising that we too often demean or dismiss opinions that are different than our own.\nBut we would be kidding ourselves if we didn't acknowledge that those age-old issues that have always roiled our country -– the problems a lot of folks would just rather brush under the rug -– those challenges are still with us today. We can't deny it.\nHowever, graduates, even in these volatile times, it would be unfair for us to ignore the changes we've seen in a generation. No longer can we be barred from a university or a hotel, or arrested for sitting at the front of the bus, or forced to use a separate bathroom or water fountain because of the color of our skin. No one is going to poll test us by demanding that we recite the Constitution or correctly guess the number of jelly beans in a jar before we're allowed to vote. So, yes, we continue to make progress here in America.\nBut we also know that the shadows of the past have not completely disappeared. Despite all the progress we've made, I know that so many of you still see these shadows every single day. Maybe it's when you're driving somewhere, and you stop for no particular reason. Maybe it's when the store you enter into, folks seem to keep an extra close eye on you as you shop. Maybe it's when you walk down the sidewalk and folks cross the street when they see you coming.\nMaybe it's when the early voting location in your neighborhood just happens to be closed, or law after law is passed about the kind of ID you need to cast your vote. Maybe it's all those schools that, despite the laws, are still very much separate and unequal, or the criminal justice system that still doesn't provide truly equal justice for far too many, or those neighborhoods that are struggling still to overcome the painful legacy of the past.\nI wish I could say otherwise, graduates, but the question isn't whether you're going to come face-to-face with these issues; the question is how you're going to respond when you do. Are you going to throw up your hands and say that progress will never come? Are you going to get angry or lash out? Are you going to turn inward, and just give in to despair and frustration? Or are you going to take a deep breath, straighten your shoulders, lift up your head, and do what Barack Obama has always done –- as he says, \"When they go low, I go high.\" (Applause.)\nThat's the choice Barack and I have made. That's what has kept us sane over the years. We simply do not allow space in our hearts, minds, or souls for darkness. Instead, we choose faith\n–- faith in ourselves, in the power of hard work. Faith in our God, whose overwhelming love sustains us every single day. That's what we choose. (Applause.)\nWe choose love –- our love for our children, our commitment to leaving them a better world. Our love for our country, which has given us so many blessings and advantages. Our love for our fellow citizens –- parents working hard to support their kids, men and women in uniform who risk everything to keep us safe, young people from the toughest backgrounds who never stop believing in their dreams -– young people like so many of you.\nThat's what we choose. And we choose excellence. We choose to tune out all the noise and strive for excellence in everything we do. No cutting corners. No taking shortcuts. No whining. We give 120 percent every single time, because excellence -- excellence is the most powerful answer you can give to the doubters and the haters. (Applause.)\nIt's also the most powerful thing you can do for yourself, because the process of striving and struggling and pushing yourself to new heights –- see, that's how you develop your God-given talents. That's how you make yourself stronger and smarter and more able to make a difference for others.\nSo those are the choices that Barack and I have made. Because in the end, we know our history, and we know that there will always be challenges and obstacles, but we also know that what we're dealing with today is nothing -– nothing -– compared to the violence, discrimination, and hatred that folks faced decades ago.\nAnd while this may feel like a volatile time -- while we may be rightfully horrified by the divisive rhetoric we're hearing in our public conversation, while we may be broken-hearted that we're still dealing with the issues of poverty, and mass incarceration, and gun violence -- it is remarkable progress that these issues are seeing the light of day at all. It's remarkable progress that the vast majority of Americans in all corners of the country vehemently disagree with this hateful language. It is remarkable progress that we're having these conversations on a national level –- and not just in black communities, but in all communities.\nSo, graduates, make no mistake about it, this moment presents a historic opportunity for change. And your generation, more than any generation in our history, truly has the tools and opportunities you need to seize this moment. I want you to think about the statistics. Today, more African Americans are graduating from college, succeeding in our workplaces, taking on positions of leadership, and reporting greater optimism about the future –- an optimism, by the way, that I very much share.\nSo the question is: Are you ready to step up and use your power and your privilege to make change? Will you honor the legacy of those who came before you who fought so hard, sacrificed so much so that you could be here in this stadium wearing those beautiful caps and gowns today?\nAnd if you have any question as to what that legacy is, let me just share with you a quick story. Several months ago, I was meeting with a group of teenage girls from Washington, D.C., and one of them asked me, \"Well, what do you think Dr. King would say about everything that's going on today?\" And I told her that none of us can really answer that question. But I said that Dr. King would probably answer it with a simple question –- and that is: \"Did you vote?\" (Applause.) Did you vote?\nSee, I told the young woman that I think Dr. King would be very concerned that after folks like Medgar Evers and so many others gave their lives fighting for the right to vote, that today, in almost every election, more than half of young African Americans have essentially disenfranchised themselves. In the 2014 midterms, African American youth turnout was less than 20 percent –- fewer than one in five of our young people voted. And here in Mississippi, it was almost lower -- certainly lower.\nBut Dr. King understood was that one of the surest paths to progress here in America runs straight through the voting booth. That's been the key to every single stride we have ever taken in this country –- from fighting discrimination to passing health care. It all starts with the ballot.\nSo, graduates, as you seek to develop your own strategies to address the problems that still plague our communities, I just ask you to remember that the power of voting is real and lasting. So you can hashtag all over Instagram and Twitter, but those social media movements will disappear faster than a Snapchat if you're not also registered to vote, if you're not also sending in your absentee ballot. (Applause.)\nIf we fail to exercise our fundamental right to vote, then I guarantee that so much of the progress we've fought for will be under threat. Congress will still be gridlocked. Statehouses will continue to roll back voting rights and write discrimination into the law. We see it right here in Mississippi -- just two weeks ago -– how swiftly progress can hurtle backward, how easy it is to single out a small group and marginalize them because of who they are or who they love.\nSo we've got to stand side by side with all our neighbors –- straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender; Muslim, Jew, Christian, Hindu immigrant, Native American -- because the march for civil rights isn't just about African Americans, it's about all Americans. It's about making things more just, more equal, more free for all our kids and grandkids. That's the story you all have the opportunity to write. That's what this historic university has prepared you to do.\nSo, graduates, here is my challenge to you today: I want you to honor the legacy of our past by making your mark on the future. Graduates, I want you to choose a career that you believe in, something that doesn't just make money but that truly makes a difference for others. And I want you to do whatever you can to reach back and pull those who still are struggling with you.\nGraduates, I want you all to be excellent at everything you do –- be an excellent boss; be an excellent employee; be an excellent parent, mentor, congregant, neighbor. Be excellent. And, graduates, when you encounter small slights or small people, I hope and I pray that you stand tall and respond with dignity and grace. Because no one –- no one -– ever succeeds in this world by playing small.\nAnd finally, graduates, I just want you to remember that decades from now, someone will be standing here where I'm standing today and they will be telling that new class of graduates about all of you. So we're counting on you to live lives worthy of retelling, lives that will inspire our next generation to keep walking that path to righteousness and doing the work to fulfill that dream.\nBecause here's the thing. I know you can do that and so much more. That's why I am here. I am so proud of you all for making it to this day, for pushing and fighting, because I know if you hold tight to the example of the folks who have led us this far, if you choose faith and love, if you strive always for dignity and excellence, then there is absolutely nothing you can't achieve.\nI say that from the bottom of my heart, because I'm not here because I'm special; I was you. And if I can be here, you can do it, too. (Applause.) And if you ever doubt the impact you can have, I just want you to think back to the story of this school\n-- this great school that you are now a part of. That tiny little seminary, as you see it now, is a distinguished university, one of the largest, most vibrant HBCUs in the country. This is your alma mater. (Applause.) Pushing forward in science and technology, the arts, education, and so much more. You all, that's your legacy.\nAnd that Jackson State football coach I mentioned earlier who helped desegregate this stadium -- his full name is Rod Paige, and he went on to become our nation's first African American Secretary of Education. (Applause.)\nAnd as for that crowd that rallied for segregation in these stands, singing \"Never No Never\" -- well, just 50 years later, our country elected an African American President for a second time, declaring \"Yes, we can!\" (Applause.)\nGraduates, that is what's possible in this country of ours. That is the direction history can take when passionate, courageous, talented young people like all of you step up and lead the way. I know you've got it in you. I can feel it right from here. And as you say here at Jackson State, the world better get ready -- because here you all come. (Applause.)\nI love you all so much. I hope you have a phenomenal day. I will pray for you every step of the way. God bless you all. Good luck on the road ahead. (Applause.) I'm proud of you all.

The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of this address.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117097", "text": "Hello, everybody. Today, there are some 2.2 million people behind bars in America. Millions more are on parole or probation. All told, we spend 80 billion taxpayer dollars each year to keep people locked up. Many are serving unnecessarily long sentences for nonviolent crimes. Almost 60 percent have mental health problems. Almost 70 percent were regular drug users. And as a whole, our prison population is disproportionately Black and Latino.\nNow, plenty of people should be behind bars. But the reason we have so many more people in prison than any other developed country is not because we have more criminals. It's because we have criminal justice policies, including unfair sentencing laws, that need to be reformed.\nWe know that simply locking people up doesn't make communities safer. It doesn't deal with the conditions that lead people to criminal activity in the first place or to return to prison later. After all, there's evidence that a 10-percent increase in the high school graduation rate leads to a nearly 10-percent decrease in arrest rates. A 10-percent wage increase for men without a college degree lowers crime by as much as 20 percent. And a growing body of research suggests that the longer people stay in jail, the more likely they are to commit another crime once they get out.\nHere's why this matters. Every year, more than 600,000 people are released from prison. We need to ensure that they are prepared to reenter society and become productive, contributing members of their families and communities and maybe even role models.\nThat's why we've been working to make our criminal justice system smarter, fairer, less expensive, and more effective. This week, the Department of Justice will highlight how strong reentry programs can make communities safer. My administration will announce new actions that will build on the progress we've already made. We'll release more details about how we are taking steps to ensure that applicants with a criminal history have a fair shot to compete for a Federal job. We're issuing a new report that details the economic costs of our high rates of incarceration. And we're calling on businesses to commit to hiring returning citizens who have earned a second chance.\nThese are just a few of the steps we're taking. But there's much more to do: disrupting the pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails; addressing the disparities in the application of criminal justice, from arrest rates to sentencing to incarceration; investing in alternatives to prison, like drug courts and mental health treatment; helping those who have served their time get the support they need to become productive members of society.\nGood people from both sides of the aisle and across all sectors are coming together on this issue. From businesses that are changing their hiring practices to law enforcement that's improving community policing, we're seeing change. Now we need a Congress that's willing to send a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill to my desk. This isn't just about what makes economic and practical sense. It's about making sure that we live up to our ideals as a nation.\nThanks, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-04-23", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Hello, everybody! Hello! Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Have a seat. Have a seat. Well, hello, London. It is good to be back in the U.K. Thank you, Khadija, for that wonderful introduction. She—I was saying backstage, I'd vote for her for something. [Laughter]\nI want to thank our U.S. Ambassador, Matthew Barzun, for all the great work that he's doing.\nAnd it is wonderful to see all of you. I guess you all know why I came this week. It's no secret. Nothing was going to stop me from wishing happy birthday to Her Majesty. [Laughter] And meeting George. [Laughter] Who was adorable. [Laughter] Michelle and I had the privilege to visit with Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh yesterday. I can't tell you what we talked about. I can tell you that I hope I am such a engaging lunch partner when I am 90. [Laughter] And I'd like to thank Her Majesty for letting us use one of her Horticultural Halls for this town hall.\nI also just came from touring Shakespeare's Globe, which is a good way to start your Saturday morning. Today is the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death. And as he once wrote, \"Brevity is the soul of wit,\" so I will try to be brief on the front end so we have time for a conversation.\nThese are some of the favorite things that I do when I travel around the world, is just have a chance to meet with young people and hear from them directly. It's inspiring to me. It gives me new ideas and, I think, underscores the degree to which young people are rising up in every continent to seize the possibilities of tomorrow.\nNow, whenever I get together with leaders of the United States and U.K., you hear a lot about the special relationship and the shared values and interests that bind us together and the way that our cooperation makes the world safer and more secure and a more just and prosperous place. And all of that is true. We go back a pretty long way, the U.K. and the U.S. We've had our quarrels. There was that whole tea incident and—[laughter]—the British burned my house down. [Laughter] But we made up. [Laughter]\nAudience member. It was for the tea.\nThe President. It was for the tea. [Laughter]\nUltimately, we made up and ended up spilling blood on the battlefield together, side by side, against fascism and against tyranny, for freedom and for democracy. And from the ashes of war, we led the charge to create the institutions and initiatives that sustained a prosperous peace: NATO, Bretton Woods, the Marshall Plan, the EU. The joint efforts and sacrifices of previous generations of Americans and Brits are a big part of why we've known decades of relative peace and prosperity in Europe, and that, in turn, has helped to spread peace and prosperity around the world.\nAnd think about how extraordinary that is. For more than 1,000 years, this continent was darkened by war and violence. It was taken for granted. It was assumed that that was the fate of man. Now, that's not to say that your generation has had it easy. Both here and the United States, your generation has grown up at a time of breathtaking change. You've come of age through 9/11 and 7/7. You've had friends go off to war. You've seen families endure recession. The challenges of our time—economic inequality and climate change, terrorism and migration—all these things are real. And in an age of instant information, where TV and Twitter can feed us a steady stream of bad news, I know that it can sometimes seem like the order that we've created is fragile, maybe even crumbling; maybe the center cannot hold.\nAnd we see new calls for isolationism or xenophobia. We see those who would call for rolling back the rights of people; people hunkering down in their own point of view and unwilling to engage in a democratic debate. And those impulses I think we can understand. They are reactions to changing times and uncertainty.\nBut when I speak to young people, I implore them and I implore you to reject those calls to pull back. I'm here to ask you to reject the notion that we're gripped by forces that we can't control. And I want you to take a longer and more optimistic view of history and the part that you can play in it. I ask you to embrace the view of one of my predecessors, President John F. Kennedy, who once said: \"Our problems are man made. Therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants.\"\nThat's how, since 1950, the global average life expectancy has grown by 25 years. Since 1990, we've cut extreme poverty around the world in half. That's how, over the past hundred years, we've come from a world where only a small fraction of women could vote to one where almost every woman can. That's how, since just the year 2000, we've come from a world without marriage equality to one where it's a reality in nearly two dozen countries, including here and in the United States.\nEvery few months, I speak with a new group of White House interns. They're roughly your age. They come in for 6 months; they are assigned to various aspects of the White House. And I often talk to them about the fact that if you could choose one moment in history in which to be born, and you didn't know ahead of time what you were to be—you didn't know whether you were a man or a woman, what nationality, what ethnicity, what religion, who your parents were, what class status you might have—if you could choose one time in history where the chances that you led a fulfilling life were most promising, you'd choose right now, this moment. Because the world, for all of its travails, for all of its challenges, has never been healthier, better educated, wealthier, more tolerant, less violent, more attentive to the rights of all people than it is today.\nNow, that doesn't mean we don't have big problems. That's not a cause for complacency, but it is a cause for optimism. You are standing at a moment where your capacity to shape this world is unmatched. What an incredible privilege that is. And you've never had better tools to make a difference, to forge a better U.K. and a better Europe and a better world.\nSo my primary message today is going to be to reject pessimism and cynicism; know that progress is possible, that our problems can be solved. Progress requires the harder path of breaking down barriers and building bridges and standing up for the values of tolerance and diversity that our nations have worked and sacrificed to secure and defend. Progress is not inevitable, and it requires struggle and perseverance and discipline and faith. But that's the story of how we won voting rights and women's rights and workers' rights and civil rights and immigration rights and gay rights: because of those who came before us, often risked their lives to give us the chance to know something better. That's what gives me so much hope about your generation. So many of you are driven by that same impulse. You are a generation that has seen integration and globalization not as threats but as opportunities—for education and exploration and employment and exchange. You're a generation who sees differences of pluralism and diversity not as a curse, but as a great gift.\nAnd that's one of the reasons why the United States has invested in young leader initiatives around the globe: in Africa and Latin America, Southeast Asia, and right here in the U.K.\nSo last summer, we launched Young Leaders U.K. And it's grown from four students in Plymouth to more than 1,000 nationwide, a diverse group of Brits aged 18 to 30, from government and NGOs and the private sector, including many of you here today. I know Ambassador Barzun has held town hall workshops at more than 100 high schools, with more than 14,000 sixth-formers. He's worked to create more of the U.S. Embassy exchange programs that have graduated alumni like Margaret Thatcher and Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. Because we want you to have the tools, connections, and resources that you need to make yourselves change agents, the change that you are looking for in the world.\nSo you're young leaders like Michael Sani, who's here today—where is Michael?\nBite the Ballot Founder Michael Sani. Behind, sir.\nThe President. Right behind. [Laughter] There he is. Michael was inspired by America's \"Rock the Vote\" voter registration initiative, so he started his own \"Bite the Bullet\"—\"Bite the Ballot\"—excuse me—[laughter]—initiative here in the U.K. And he spent time in Greensboro, North Carolina, where he learned about our civil rights movement. And he said: \"I have a new understanding of the meaning of perseverance, resilience, and delayed gratification—about fighting for change you may not live to see, but your children will live to see.\"\nFighting for change that you may not live to see, but your children will live to see. That's what this is all about. That's what we are all about. Whether in the cold war or world war, movements for economic or social justice, efforts to combat climate change, our best impulses has always been to leave a better world for the next generation.\nMaryam Ahmed is here today. Where is Maryam? Where are you? Are you also behind me? [Laughter] There's Maryam up top. It's that impulse that compels a young leader like Maryam to say, I may have grown up one of eight in a small West London house, but I'm going to use the education I got at Oxford to help any child have the same opportunities that I have.\nAnd Ali Hashem is here. Where is Ali? Right there. It's the same impulse that's led Ali to say, I may have fled Syria as a child, but now that I'm in elective office, I'm going to use my power to help other refugees like me.\nAnd Becca Bunce is here today. Where is Becca? There's Becca. It's that impulse that compels a young leader like Becca to say that, as a woman with a disability, I may have fallen down at times, but people who believed in me picked me up. And I'm going to pay it forward by fighting for people with disabilities and against violence against women, because I believe the world can be a better place.\nYou can't help but be inspired by the stories of young people like these, both in the United States and the United Kingdom. And think of all the good that we can do together. Think of all the good that we have yet to accomplish. There is not a challenge on this planet that our two countries don't take on together. And as long as your generation nurtures that special relationship and learns from one another and stands together, I'm confident the future is brighter than the past and that our best days are still ahead of us.\nSo with that, let's have a conversation. All right, well, you guys were ready, I guess. [Laughter] Here's what we're going to do. I am going to go boy, girl, boy, girl—[laughter]—to make sure that it's fair. And I'll try to get as many questions as I can. Introduce yourself. We have mikes. Right there. And tell me who you are and where you're from and then try to keep your question or comment relatively brief so I can get as many as possible. All right?\nAnd we will start right here.\nNorthern Ireland/Peace and Reconciliation Efforts\nQ. Mr. President, my name is Keona McCarney from Belfast, Northern Ireland. And the special relationship is felt nowhere stronger than in Northern Ireland, where America has played a really important role in our peace process. How will your predecessor and those to come after you help to foster that?\nThe President. Well, in Northern Ireland is a story of perseverance. And the fact that your generation—how old are you now?\nQ. Twenty-one.\nThe President. Twenty-one. I mean, your experience has been entirely different than your parents'. There are still huge problems there, some of them political, some of them economic. But every year, we have, on St. Patrick's Day, folks from Ireland come. And we had both the—your First Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister come. And folks are working these issues through.\nAnd what's interesting is the degree to which the example of peacemaking in Northern Ireland is now inspiring others. So, in Colombia, Latin America right now, they're trying to undergo a peace process. And they've actually brought people from Northern Ireland to come and describe how do you overcome years of enmity and hatred and intolerance and try to shape a country that is unified.\nYou know this better than I do, but one of the things that you see in Northern Ireland that's most important is the very simple act of recognizing the humanity of those on the other side of the argument, having empathy and a sense of connection to people who are not like you. That's taken time, but you're now seeing that. And I think among young people who are interacting more, you're seeing that.\nIt requires also forging a new identity that is about being from Northern Ireland as opposed to being Unionist or Sinn Fein or—and just deciding the country as a whole is more important than any particular faction or any particular flag.\nBut this is a challenging time to do that. Because there is so much uncertainty in the world right now, because things are changing so fast, there is a temptation to forge identities, tribal identities that give you a sense of certainty, a buffer against change. And that's something that our young people—we have to fight against. Whether you're talking about Africa or the Middle East or Northern Ireland or Burma, the forces that lead to the most violence and the most injustice typically spring out of people saying, I want to feel important by dividing the world into \"us\" and \"them.\" And \"them\" threatens me, and so I've got to make sure that my tribe strikes out first. And fighting that mentality and that impulse requires us to begin very young, with our kids. One of the most encouraging things I've seen in Northern Ireland is children starting to go to school together. Right? And having a sense of—that we're all in this together, as opposed to, it's \"us\" against \"them.\"\nBut it's going to take some time. It will depend on leaders like you to make it happen, all right? No pressure. You're going to be fine. [Laughter] You're going to do it. All right, good question.\nAll right, it's a gentleman's turn. That gentleman right there. Yes, you. No, yes—there's nobody behind you, right there. No, no, no. [Laughter] You. Hold on a second. I was pointing down here——\nQ. Oh, right.\nThe President.——but go ahead, and I'll call on him next. Go ahead.\nCounterterrorism Strategy/Iran/Global Economic Development/Education\nQ. Hi, I'm Peter from London.\nThe President. Hi, Peter.\nQ. I—thank you. [Laughter] So I always imagine in the future, so if your successor comes to you and she says, so—[laughter]—suppose it could be Bernie. [Laughter] And she says, oh, we need to prioritize education, health care, and defense. These are three issues we've got; we've got a limited budget. And what's your priority, and how do you think about ranking those? And what do you think—what would you like to see as your core priorities there?\nThe President. For the next President?\nQ. And ongoing, and for yourself as well. But, yes, so——\nThe President. Well, one of the things that I've learned as President is, I don't always have the luxury of just choosing one or two things. Turns out that how well we do in the United States and how well the globe does depends on a lot of things.\nMy first priority is to keep the American people safe. Just like I'm sure Prime Minister Cameron, if you asked him, \"What is your first priority?\" it's keeping the United Kingdom safe. So security is always going to be a top-of-the-list item.\nAnd the threats from ISIL and transnational terrorism are absolutely critical to address. But how we address them is important. And recognizing that security is not just a matter of military actions, but is a matter of the messages we send and the institutions that we build and the diplomacy that we engage in and the opportunities that we present to people. That is going to be important for the next President of the United States and any global leader to recognize.\nI mean, I am in awe of our respective militaries, the men and women in uniform who serve their country and make such extraordinary sacrifices. But we do them a disservice if we think that the entire burden of keeping the world safe is just placed on those who are in uniform. That's where diplomacy comes in.\nYou look at something like Iran, where obviously, the United States and Iran has had a terrible relationship since 1979; the theocracy there has engaged in all kinds of very dangerous and provocative behaviors, and they were on the path to obtain a nuclear weapon. The hard, diplomatic work that we did, along with the U.K. and the EU and members of the Security Council, to forge an agreement where they are no longer on the path to get a nuclear weapon—we never engaged in a military strike to do it, but it resulted in a much safer world.\nAnd the same is true when you think about development in sub-Saharan Africa. An organization like Boko Haram is ideologically driven, and we have to help countries like Nigeria fight against the brutality and the rape and the pillage that they engage in. But if there are communities where children can't read or feed themselves, they are much more vulnerable to fostering these kinds of demented ideologies.\nSo I think it's not an either-or question, and I—and it's important for young people who—very many thoughtful young people, I think, instinctually are suspicious of military action because too often it's been used as a knee-jerk response to problems as opposed to part of a broader set of solutions. But we have to do both, and we can do both.\nIn terms of the United States right now, I would love to see a focus on early childhood education as a—as the next step in filling out our social safety net. We don't yet have institutions that are fully adapted to the fact that, guess what, women work and support families, and they need things like paid family leave and high-quality childcare. And we know that when we invest in children between the ages of zero and 3 that the outcomes in terms of them getting effective educations and having thriving lives are enormous. We ended up saving huge amounts of money from reduced crime and poverty, if we just make that early investment. That's something that some countries do better than others, and we can learn from other countries along those lines.\nAcross the board, across the developing world right now, I think we have to attend to issues of inequality. And to do—one of the places to start addressing these issues of inequality is making sure that every child is getting a decent education. And a lot of our countries are not doing as well as they should on that front.\nSo, all right, who is next? All right. Young lady right there. Right—you, yes, you. [Laughter]\nTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership/Trans-Pacific Partnership/Vietnam\nQ. Hi, my name is Fatima, and my question is, do you think signing the T-TIP agreement will have a negative impact on the EU, due to the standards of regulation enforced?\nThe President. For those of you who are not aware, T-TIP, as we call it, is the trade deal that is being negotiated between the United States and the European Union. We're—we haven't gotten it done yet. The truth is, is that the United States and Europe already have enormous amounts of trade, but there are still barriers that exist that prevent businesses and individuals that are providing services to each other to be able to do so seamlessly. And if we are able to get this deal done, it's estimated that it will create millions of jobs and billions of dollars of benefits on both sides of the Atlantic.\nBut getting trade deals done is tough, because each country has its own parochial interests and factions. And in order to get a trade deal done, each country has to give something up. So it's a time-consuming process. And people, right now, are especially suspicious of trade deals because trade deals feel as if they are accelerating some of these globalizing trends that have weakened labor unions and allowed for jobs to be shipped to low-wage countries. And some of the criticism in the past of trade deals are legitimate. Sometimes, they have served the interests of large corporations and not necessarily of workers in the countries that participate in them. But we've just gone through this exercise between the United States and Asia, where we organized a large regional trade deal with 11 countries, and part of the argument that I'm making in the United States is that the answer to globalization and income inequality and lack of wage growth is not to try to pull up the drawbridge and shut off trade. The idea is to make sure that in these trade deals we are embedding standards and values that help lift workers' rights and help lift environmental standards and help fight against things like human trafficking and child labor. And our values should be embedded in how countries trade with each other.\nSo, for example, Vietnam was one of the countries that is part of this Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we said to Vietnam, if you want access to our markets—we understand you have a different political system than us, but if workers have no rights and there's no possibility of organizing labor unions, we're not going to let you sell a bunch of sneakers and T-shirts into our country because by definition you're going to be undercutting the standards of living of folks in our country. And so for the first time, the Government of Vietnam has started to change its laws to recognize labor unions. Now, they're still suppressed. Those standards are not where they are in the United States or the U.K. But it gives us a lever by which to begin to raise standards all around the world.\nNow, that's less of an issue between the United States and Europe. Main thing between the United States and Europe is trying to just break down some of the regulatory differences that make it difficult to do business back and forth. Plus, making sure those light sockets are all matched up. [Laughter] I mean, those light sockets are really irritating. [Laughter]\nLet's see. Oh, I promised I was going to call on this gentleman back here. Yes, sir. No, no, right here. You keep passing by this poor guy. [Laughter]\nThe President's Achievements/Civil Rights/Social Change\nQ. My name is Elijah—[inaudible]—and I'm from London. After 8 years, what would you say you want your legacy to be?\nThe President. Well, I mean I have—I still have a few more months, so—[laughter]. I—[applause]—no, no, no, that's—actually, 8 months and 52 days or—not that I'm counting. [Laughter] I just made that up, I actually don't know. [Laughter] It's roughly something like that.\nYes, it's interesting, when you're in the job, you're not thinking on a day-to-day basis about your legacy, you're thinking about how do I get done what I'm trying to get done right now. And I don't think that I'll have a good sense of my legacy until 10 years from now, and I can look back with some perspective and get a sense of what worked and what didn't.\nThere are things I'm proud of. The basic principle that in a country as wealthy as the United States, every person should have access to high-quality health care that they can afford, that's something I'm proud of, I believe in. Saving the world economy from a Great Depression, that was pretty good. [Laughter]\nThe first time I came to London was April of 2009, and the world economy was in a free fall, in part because of the reckless behavior of folks on Wall Street, and—but in part because of reckless behavior of a lot of financial institutions around the globe. For us to be able to mobilize the world community to take rapid action to stabilize the financial markets, and then in the United States, to pass Wall Street reforms that make it much less likely that a crisis like that can happen again, I'm proud of that. I think on the international stage, the work that we did to get the possible nuclear weapons that Iran was developing out of Iran, and doing so without going to war, is something I'm very proud of.\nThere are things that people don't pay a lot of attention to now, but the response to the Ebola crisis: For about 3 weeks, everybody sure—was sure that everybody was going to die—we're all going to get Ebola, we're all going to die. [Laughter] And there was sort of hysteria about it. And then, everybody forgot about it. And the reason everybody forgot about it was because we mounted what was probably one of the most effective, if not the most effective, international public health responses in the history of the world and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\nSo, I don't know, I'll look at a scorecard at the end. [Laughter] And I'm proud about the fact that I think that I have been true to myself during this process. I don't—sometimes, I look back at what I said when I was running for office and what I'm saying today, and they match up. So there's, I think, a certain core integrity to what I've been trying to do. We've had failures, and we've—occasionally, we've been blocked, but this goes back to one of the themes of my opening statement, and it's important for all the young people here to remember: Change takes time, and oftentimes, what you start has to then be picked up by your successors or the next generation.\nIf you think about the gap between—well, something I'm most familiar with, the American civil rights movement. You had abolitionists in the 1700s who were fighting against slavery and for a hundred years built a movement that eventually led to a Civil War and the amendments to our Constitution that ended slavery and called for equal protection under the law. It then took another hundred years for those rights that had been enshrined in the Constitution to actually be affirmed through the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And then, it's taken another 50 years to try to make sure that those rights are realized. And they're still not fully realized. Well, there's still discrimination in aspects of American life, even with a Black President.\nAnd in fact, one of the dangers has been that by electing a Black President, people have then said, well, there must be no problems at all. And obviously, you see Ferguson and some of the issues that we've seen in the criminal justice system indicating the degree to which that was always false.\nSo does that mean all the work that was done along the way was worthless? No, of course not. But it does mean that if any of you begin to work on an issue that you care deeply about, don't be disappointed if a year out, things haven't been completely solved. Don't give up and succumb to cynicism if, after 5 years, poverty has not been eradicated and prejudice is still out there somewhere and we haven't resolved all of the steps we need to take to reverse climate change. It's okay.\nDr. King said, \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\" And it doesn't bend on its own. It bends because we pull it in that direction. But it requires a series of generations working and building off of what the previous one has done.\nAnd so, as President, I think about it in those ways. I consider myself a runner, and I run my leg of the race. But then, I've got a baton, and I'm passing it on to the next person. And hopefully, they're running in the right direction—[laughter]—as opposed to the wrong direction. [Laughter] And hopefully, they don't drop the baton. And then, they go, and then they pass it on to somebody else. Right? And that's how I think you've got to think about change generally. Okay.\nAll right. It is a young woman's turn. Yes, right here, in the red. Yes, you. No, no, that's you. You're wearing red. Yes. [Laughter]\nSame-Sex Marriage/Black Lives Matter Movement/Political Activism/Climate Change\nQ. Thanks. Hi, I'm Louisa. I'm a climate change campaigner, and I wanted to thank you for your smart and creative way to try and sort of get a grip on the problem.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. And given you've been talking about the value of social movements, I was wondering which campaigns have made you change your mind while you've been in office and inspired you to do things and where you think we need more external pressure from campaigns to create meaningful change.\nThe President. Well, that's an interesting question. And are you talking about climate change, in particular? Or are you talking about just generally, on a whole spectrum of issues? That's interesting. It's interesting because I started as a community organizer trying to pressure politicians into getting things done. And then—now I'm on the other side—[laughter]—and so what has worked and what hasn't?\nWell, in the United States, what's been remarkable is the rapidity with which the marriage equality movement changed the political landscape and hearts and minds and resulted in actual changes in law. It's probably been the fastest set of changes that—in terms of a social movement that I've seen.\nOn issues of LGBT rights generally, I didn't need a lot of pressure. I came in working on ending a policy called \"don't ask, don't tell,\" that was preventing LGBT citizens from serving in our military openly. We did that very systematically. Policies in terms of those who had HIV/AIDS being able to emigrate to our country, hospital visitations—there were a whole host of things that we were already doing.\nBut on marriage equality, I was in favor of what's called civil unions. My notion was initially that labeling those partnerships as marriage wasn't necessary as long as people were getting the same rights, and it would disentangle them from some of the religious connotations that marriage had in the minds of a lot of Americans. And that's where I think—now, I have to confess, my children generally had an impact on me. People I loved who were in monogamous same-sex relationships explained to me what I should have understood earlier, which is, it was not simply about legal rights, but about a sense of stigma, that if you're calling it something different, it means that somehow it means less in the eyes of society.\nI believe that the manner in which the LGBT community described marriage equality as not some radical thing, but actually reached out to people who said they care about family values, and said, if you care about everything that families provide—stability and commitment and partnership and—then this is actually a pretty conservative position to take, that you should be in favor of this. I thought there was a lot of smarts in reaching out and building and framing the issue in a way that could bring in people who initially didn't agree with them.\nAs a general rule, I think that what, for example, Black Lives Matter is doing now to bring attention to the problem of a criminal justice system that sometimes is not treating people fairly based on race or reacting to shootings of individuals by police officers has been really effective in bringing attention to problems.\nOne of the things I caution young people about, though, that I don't think is effective is, once you've highlighted an issue and brought it to people's attention and shined a spotlight, and elected officials or people who are in a position to start bringing about change are ready to sit down with you, then you can't just keep on yelling at them. And you can't refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position.\nThe value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room, and then to start trying to figure out how is this problem going to be solved. You, then, have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable, that can institutionalizes the changes you seek, and to engage the other side and occasionally to take half a loaf that will advance the gains that you seek, understanding that there's going to be more work to do, but this is what is achievable at this moment.\nAnd too often, what I see is wonderful activism that highlights a problem, but then people feel so passionately and are so invested in the purity of their position that they never take that next step and say, okay, well, now I got to sit down and try to actually get something done.\nSo the Paris Agreement that we just negotiated and that a number of countries just signed yesterday on Earth Day, the agreement we shaped is not going to, by itself, solve climate change. The science argues that the world is going to be—going to need to do a lot more in order for us to prevent catastrophic climate change. But my strategy from the start has been, all right, if I can get the Chinese to agree with us, as the two largest emitters, that we have to do something, and lock in China with us for the first time to take some serious steps around reducing carbon emissions, and if by getting the two largest emitters, I can now leverage all the other smaller countries to also put in their own targets for emissions, and if we can set up an architecture that recognizes the need for carbon reduction and has—and can allow people to—or allow countries to hold each other accountable, then that's a start. And we can now start turning up the dial as our science and our understanding improves, as technology improves, so that poor countries don't feel that they have to choose between development and carbon reductions. And there are all kinds of compromises in that. But it's a start.\nNow, there are some climate activists who, after the Paris Agreement was signed, said, ah, this is not enough! But they're not in a conversation, apparently, with Prime Minister Modi of India, for example, who's thinking, I've still got several hundred million people without electricity, and I have some obligation to try to relieve them of their poverty and suffering, so I've got to balance those equities against the imperatives of the planet as a whole.\nAnd so—now, but the good news is, is that most of the groups that have been involved in this process have been pretty sophisticated. But that's a general principle that I think all of you should consider. Make noise and occasionally you can act a little crazy to get attention, to shine a spotlight on the issue, to highlight it. But once people who are in power and in a position to actually do something about it are prepared to meet and listen with you, do your homework, be prepared, present a plausible set of actions, and negotiate and be prepared to move the ball down the field even if it doesn't get all the way there. All right?\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. No. You do, but it wouldn't be fair if you just start yelling out a question and I—because it's a guy's turn also, so you—[laughter]. Q. [Inaudible]\nThe President. The—all right, go ahead. And——\nSomalia\nQ. Thank you, President, firstly, for all you did for the world and for mankind. I think you made a great contribution, and you inspire a lot of young people across the world. But my question is slightly—on East Africa.\nThe President. Okay.\nQ. Since you said, and—you can ask me any question. Just last week, 400 young boys has died in the Mediterranean Sea in trying to seek a better life. Mostly left in Somalia. And those young boys has lost their livelihoods. Since, there is a international ships coming to the Somali territorial water, and those ships has been trying to protect the international ships from the piracy. But at the same time, they have been dumping, there has been a lot of proven cases that they have been dumping a waste in Somali Sea. And also there is a proven cases within the coast cities that children are dying with very strange diseases that they've never seen, that is these things are coming to the coast that came out from the sea.\nSo today I have the opportunity to ask you, while you're here for the next 8 or 9 months that you have, can you kindly use your leverage within the international arena to galvanize the international community to look at this issue? And can you share some practical steps that you can share—that you can take to ensure this doesn't happen.\nThe President. Well, I'll be honest with you. I'm not fully familiar with some of the issues you referred to. I'm certainly familiar with the challenges that Somalia has been going through. And we've been working aggressively to try to help Mogadishu develop a functioning state that can protect its people and that can get an economy moving that gives young people opportunity.\nI'm certainly familiar with the issues of privacy—of piracy and the international concerns that led to many of these ships patrolling these areas. I'm less familiar with some of the issues that you discussed. So what I'll do is, after this meeting, as we're shaking hands, I'll try to get some additional information from you. One of the things I've learned as President is, although you can always fake your way through an answer, sometimes, it's really good just to say, you know what, I don't know all the answers on this one. So I will—I'll find out more about the specifics that you're talking about.\nAll right. I will, I—see, now since you've raised your hand and you didn't continue to act crazy, I'm going to go ahead and call on you. Go ahead. [Laughter]\nQ. First of all, sincerest apologies.\nThe President. That's okay.\nQ. .I guess I got overwhelmed.\nThe President. You got excited.\nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights\nQ. My name is Maria Munir. And you've been speaking a lot about how we have to become the change that we want to see.\nThe President. Right. Q. And you've spoken about progress, about human rights, and about how we in the U.S. and the U.K. need to lead in terms of civil rights movements and LGBTQ issues. Now I'm about to do something terrifying, which is I'm coming out to you as a nonbinary person, which means that I don't fit within—I'm getting emotional, I'm so sorry.\nThe President. That's okay.\nQ. Because I come from a—I'm from a Pakistani Muslim background, which inevitably has cultural implications. And I know that in North Carolina, recently, with the bathroom bill, people are being forced, obviously, to produce birth certificates to prove their gender in order to go to a toilet. In the U.K., we don't recognize nonbinary people under the Equality Act, so we literally have no rights. So if there was any discrimination, there's nothing we can do.\nI've been working for the last 9 months with the U.K. Civil Service Fast Stream with Gillian Smith in order to do what I can, even though I'm still at university and running for local election at the same time in Watford. I've managed to get them to respect pronouns. I've managed to get them to commit to gender-neutral toilets. And these are thing I've done as a student. And I really, really wish that yourself and David Cameron would take us seriously as transgender people. And perhaps you could elucidate as to what you can do to go beyond what has been accepted as the LGBTQ rights movement, in including people who fit outside the social norms.\nThe President. Well, look, I think that—[applause]. First of all, that wasn't that crazy. I thought you were going to ask to come up here and dance with me or something. [Laughter] But, I mean, look, I'm incredibly proud of the steps it sounds like you've already taken to speak out about your own experience and then to try to create a social movement and change laws. It sounds to me like you're on the right track.\nI can't speak for David Cameron, although I will say that on LGBT issues, I think David's been ahead of the curve relative to a lot of other leaders around the world and even here in the U.K. I can say from my perspective that we're taking a lot of serious steps to address these issues within the Federal Government.\nThe challenge we've had is, North Carolina, the law that comes up, for example, that's a State law. And because of our system of government, I can't overturn, on my own, State laws unless a Federal law is passed that prohibits States from doing these things. And with the Congress I currently have, that's not likely to happen. [Laughter]\nBut we're doing a lot of work administratively. And as I said, you should feel encouraged just by virtue of the fact that I think social attitudes on this issue have changed faster than I've seen on any other issue. It won't—it doesn't feel fast enough for you or for those who are impacted. And that's good. You shouldn't feel satisfied. You should keep pushing. But I think the trend lines are good on this. We're moving in the right direction and, in part, because of courageous and active young people like yourself. So stick with it.\nAll right. Let's see. Gentleman in the green here.\nPolitical Compromise\nQ. Thank you much. I'm Alex Clements from Manchester. I agree with everything you've said so far about compromise. But in an age of polarized politics, how do you inspire people to commit to compromise and fighting for the middle ground? The President. I think that's a great question. It's something that I wrestle with. I would distinguish between compromising on principles and compromising in getting things done in the here and now. And what I mean by that is, I am uncompromising on the notion that every person, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, has a dignity and worth and have to be treated equally. So I'm uncompromising in that basic principle.\nAnd I'm also of the belief that in order to realize that principle, every child has to have true opportunity; that every child is deserving of a decent education and decent health care and the ability to go to college and—so that they can make of themselves what they will. So that's a powerful principle in me. That drives my politics.\nBut if I'm sitting with Congress, and I have the opportunity to get half a million more kids into an early childhood education program, even though I know that that will leave 2 million who need it out of the program, but the alternative is none, I'll take half a million, right? And I can wake—I can look at myself in the mirror and feel good about the 500,000 that I'm helping, knowing that the next round of budget negotiations that we have, I'm going to go for another half a million, and I'm going to go for another half a million after that.\nSo I think it's important for everyone to understand that you—you'd have to be principled, you have to have a north star, a moral compass. There should be a reason for you getting involved in social issues other than vanity or just trying to mix and mingle and meet cute people of—[laughter]—that you're interested in—although that's not a bad reason for—[laughter]. But you have to recognize that, particularly in pluralistic societies and democratic governments like we have in the United States and the U.K., there are people who disagree with us. They have different perspectives. They come from different points of view. And they're not bad people just because they disagree with us. They may, in fact, assert that they've got similar principles to ours, but they just disagree with us on the means to vindicate those principles.\nAnd you are absolutely right that we are in this age now—partly because of what's happened with our media—in which people from different political parties, different political orientations, can spend the bulk of their day only talking to and listening to and hearing the perspectives of people who already agree with them. I know less about the U.K. media, but in the United States, it used to be, we had three television stations. And people might complain about the dominance of these three television stations, but there was one virtue to them, which was, everybody was kind of watching the same thing and had the same understanding of what the facts were on any given issue. And today, you have what, 500 television stations, and the Internet will give you a thousand different sources of information. And so what's increasingly happening in the United States is, is that if you're a conservative, then you're watching Fox News or you're reading a conservative blogpost. If you're a liberal, then you're reading the Huffington Post or reading the New York Times. And there's this massive divergence that's taking place in terms of just what the agreed-upon facts and assumptions are that we're talking about. And that does make it harder to compromise.\nAnd there have been some interesting studies that have been done showing that if you spend time with people who just agree with you on any particular issue, that you become even more extreme in your convictions because you're never contradicted and everybody just mutually reinforces their perspective. That's why I think it is so important for all the young people here to seek out people who don't agree with you. That will teach you to compromise. It will also help you, by the way, if you decide to get married. [Laughter]\nSo—but the most important thing is understanding that compromise does not mean surrendering what you believe, it just means that you are recognizing the truth, the fact that\nthese other people who disagree with you or this other political party or this other nation, they have—that they have dignity too, that they have worth as well, and you have to hear them and see them. And sometimes, we don't. We just——\nAll right, how much time do I have, by the way, people? One more question? I'll make it two. [Laughter] I'll make it two. All right. Let's see. Let's see. [Laughter] All right, well, this young lady right there. Go ahead.\nQ. Good morning, Mr. President.\nThe President. Good morning.\nQ. I'm losing my voice, so I apologize.\nThe President. That's okay.\nLeadership\nQ. My name is Helen Vaughan-Evans, and my question for you is, what leadership skills have you found yourself relying on most during your time in office, and why?\nThe President. A thick skin—[laughter]—is very helpful. I was just talking about this, actually, with the Ambassador, wasn't I, last night? Where is Matthew? I think I was just talking about this. Yes, I think I was just talking—we were just talking about this.\nTwo things I'm pretty good at. I mean—well, let me say this. One of the things that happens as you get older is, you are, hopefully, more aware of and honest with yourself about what your strengths are and what your weaknesses are. I could list my weaknesses, but you asked me about what things I've found useful—[laughter]—so I'll skip over that.\nTwo things I'm pretty good at: One is attracting talent. And anybody who wants to be a leader, I would advise you to spend a lot of time thinking about, how am I helping other people do great things? Because, as President of the United States, I am dealing with so many issues, and I can't be expert on everything, and I can't be everywhere. And the one thing I can do is assemble a team of people who are really good and really smart and really committed and care about their mission and have integrity and then give them the tools or get rid of the barriers or help coach them so that they can do a great job.\nAnd I think leaders who think that their primary job is to make everybody do exactly what they want, as opposed to helping to organize really talented people to collectively go to where we need to go, typically stumble. You should be predisposed to other people's power: How can I make the people around me do great things? If they do, then, by definition, I'll succeed, because that's my job, is to get this team moving in the right direction.\nSo that's one. Second thing, I'm pretty good at setting a course, a general direction, and being able to, hopefully, unify that team around that general direction. Oftentimes, I have to rely on other people to implement and execute to get there, but setting a direction requires also listening to what is it that's important to people.\nAnd the third thing is synthesizing. I think it's very useful as a leader to be able to—particularly on complex issues—to sit around a table and hear a lot of different points of view and be able to get to what's the nub of the issue, what's the heart of the problem, what's the essential conflict that we're trying to resolve, and get everybody to see the problem the same—see what the problem is. Because I see a lot of organizations that spend a lot of time doing a lot of work, but they're working on the wrong thing or they're distracted from the essential issue. Somebody once said, it's more important to do the right thing than to do things right. And what they meant was you can hack away and build this amazing path through the jungle, but if you're headed in the wrong direction, then it's a waste of time. So you've got to make sure that people understand what it is that we're trying to solve.\nYes, that's enough.[Laughter]\nI've got time for one more. All right. The Sikh gentleman. Yes.\nRacial Profiling/Transportation Security Administration/Terrorism/Anti-Muslim Discrimination\nQ. Hello. So my issue is also—my question is related to an issue which minorities face in the U.S.A. We see many times Sikhs being discriminated against, as Muslims. And even if we were Muslims, that still doesn't give the right for anyone to be Islamophobic to us. So my question is, why isn't a firm stand being taken on issues such as airport security, where there's a lot of issues with the TSA? Since your neighbors in Canada—Justin Trudeau, he recently said that he's going to apologize for an issue which happened 102 years ago, and he has recently become Prime Minister, so why is it that he is taking a firm stand on an issue which happened so long ago, whereas countries such as the U.S.A. aren't taking a stand against discrimination when it is 2016? [Applause]\nThe President. Well, the—hold on. Before everybody starts applauding that question—[laughter]—let's make sure that we're on the same wavelength in terms of facts. I have taken an adamant stand against making sure that we're not racially profiling in airports. And it is explicit TSA policy not to racially profile.\nNow, does that mean that out of the hundreds of airports and thousands of TSA officials that there has not been times where a Sikh is going through the airport and somebody targets them for secondary screening because of what they look like? Of course, that's happened. But that's not my administration's policy. And I'm happy to provide you with chapter and verse as to why we have taken an explicit stand against this.\nIt does raise a broader issue that you're mentioning, which is that in pluralistic societies like the United States, like the U.K., in diverse societies, one of our biggest challenges is going to be how do we approach keeping people safe and preventing terrorist acts. There was a time when terrorism was—here in the U.K.—was largely emanating from the IRA. So this is not unique—a uniquely Muslim problem. What is also true is, today, there are a tiny subset of groups that are—have perverted Islam in justifying killing innocent people. And how we do that in a way that is consistent with our values and consistent with pluralism and respect for religion is vitally important.\nAnd I, about 4 months ago, visited a mosque in the United States precisely to send a message that our greatest allies in this process are the incredible Muslim Americans who are, historically, fully integrated into our society; that economically are actually doing better than the average American in many measures; that are fighting in our Armed Forces; that are defending our people in all sorts of ways; and that if we engage in Islamophobia, we are not only betraying what is essential to us, but just as a practical matter, engaging in self-defeating behavior if we're serious about terrorism. And so the language that we use, the tactics and approaches that we take, the respect that we show all people—those are security matters. They're not—it's not just feel-good, liberal political correctness. It's a matter of what is it that we're fighting for, and how are we going to win this fight against people who are so blocked off from the reality of others who don't—they don't agree with that they'd be willing to blow themselves up and kill hundreds of people. It's the extreme of what I was just talking to this gentleman about, about the inability to compromise and recognize difference and feel comfortable with that.\nSo look, this is going to be a challenging issue for some time to come. But I'm confident that it is an issue that we can succeed at, as long as young people like you are committed to not just believing the right thing and feeling the right ways, but fighting for it; and so long as you're engaged and active and speaking out and listening. And if you do that, I feel pretty good about our futures. I feel good about our chances. All right?\nYou guys inspire me. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you!", "timestamp": "2016-04-23", "title": "Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session at a Young Leaders of the United Kingdom Town Hall Meeting in London, England"}

He was headed later Sunday to Connecticut and he will be in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on Monday speaking to Pennsylvania supporters.\nEarlier Sunday, Sanders said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that he would carry the contest with Clinton through all of the remaining states and on to the Democratic National Convention this summer. \"We are the future of the Democratic Party, so I'm very proud of where we are and we look forward to fighting this out through California.\"\nHe discussed his carbon tax proposal in the interview and also called for Democrats to embrace a Medicare-for-all health care system, tuition-free public colleges and universities, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and reforming the corrupt campaign finance system that props up a rigged economy.\nAlso on Sunday Sanders picked up the endorsement of the 35,000-member United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America. Peter Knowlton, the union's national president, called Sanders \"the most pro-worker pro-union presidential candidate\" in his lifetime.", "timestamp": "2016-04-24", "title": "Press Release - Sanders Challenges Clinton on Climate Change in Rhode Island"}

Abrams writes that Cruz understands the intricacies of Mideast politics and that \"Unlike Trump, the concept of American \"neutrality\" regarding Israel never crossed his mind.\"\nExcerpts below, view full article here.\nCommentary: Cruz understands dangers, realities of Mideast\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer\nElliott Abrams\nTwo things were immediately clear in my meetings with Cruz. First, the reputation he has for sheer intelligence was obviously well-deserved. His grasp of the dangers facing American interests in the Middle East and facing Israel was broad and deep. He had the facts and he got the nuances. That's not to say we agreed all the time. We sometimes disagreed and debated, and I came to appreciate that he wanted to be challenged by someone else who knew the region and also had strong views. He wanted to think it all through.\nSecond, his commitment to Israel's security was readily apparent and deeply felt. That was one reason he so strongly opposed the nuclear agreement with Iran: because it would legitimize its nuclear program and lead it in only 10 years to a possible nuclear weapon. While Donald Trump is talking about extracting more from Israel for its defense, Cruz wants to beef up the missile defense programs like Iron Dome, David's Sling, and Arrow that are crucial for Israel — and immensely valuable for the United States, with our bases all over the globe.\nCruz also understood fully the history of the \"peace process\" between Israel and the Palestinians, with generous Israeli offers (in 2000 and 2008) being rejected by the Palestinian leadership. He understands fully how deeply Israelis seek peace — but how dangerous a bad deal would be to their security, with Hamas in Gaza, ISIS in Syria, and violence throughout the region. Unlike Trump, the concept of American \"neutrality\" regarding Israel never crossed his mind.", "timestamp": "2016-04-24", "title": "Press Release - Senior Reagan Administration Official Elliott Abrams Urges Pennsylvanians to Support Ted Cruz"}

As governor since 2011, the 63-year-old Western Pennsylvania native has more time as an executive than his two GOP opponents combined — the kind in which you can't fire someone because you didn't get your way. He was also a state senator and served 18 years in Congress. On the House Armed Services Committee, he was a strong supporter of President Ronald Reagan's foreign policy. As chairman of the House Budget Committee in the '90s, he was part of the leadership team that helped produce balanced budgets. The lesson?

He also chaired the House Budget Committee for six years during which time the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was passed with his input and support.\nKasich then decided to get out of politics for a while, venturing into business and political commentary on TV before the urge to serve his fellow citizens came calling again.\nHe successfully ran for governor of Ohio, defeating an incumbent Democrat. Kasich wasted little time and even less money, eventually turning a deficit of anywhere between $6 billion and $8 billion into a $2 billion surplus for the Buckeye State, all while cutting income taxes.\nKasich has proven himself to be a problem-solver at a time our country needs one most. He's not afraid to buck the Republican leadership if he thinks doing so puts America first. He has the experience as both a legislator and an executive to help bridge the ever-widening canyon between the White House and the Capitol and make the federal government work for the American people once again.\nAnd he is the only candidate in either party who has consistently shown a temperament befitting a president, not to mention the fact that polls consistently show Kasich has the best chance of keeping Hillary Clinton from winning this fall, thereby preventing a de facto third term for Obama.\nOur country needs a uniter, not a divider. We need an experienced leader, not another freshman senator nor someone who has never before held public office.\nJohn Kasich is simply the best man to bring this country together and lead us forward.

Also, approximately 80% of the Republican Party is against him. Governor Kasich, who has only won 1 state out of 41, in other words, he is 1 for 41 and he is not even doing as well as other candidates who could have stubbornly stayed in the race like him but chose not to do so. Marco Rubio, as an example, has more delegates than Kasich and yet suspended his campaign one month ago. Others, likewise, have done much better than Kasich, who would get slaughtered by Hillary Clinton once the negative ads against him begin. 85% of Republican voters are against Kasich.\nCollusion is often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive. They are mathematically dead and this act only shows, as puppets of donors and special interests, how truly weak they and their campaigns are.

Additionally, I am far ahead of both candidates with delegates and would be receiving in excess of 60% of the vote except for the fact that there were so many candidates running against me.\nBecause of me, everyone now sees that the Republican primary system is totally rigged.

In Indiana, it's a tighter race there, too. Clinton is up five points over Sanders 49 to 44 among likely Democratic primary voters.\nWith that, we turn to Senator Sanders, who joins us from Providence this morning.\nSenator, I want to ask, Hillary Clinton has more votes and delegates. Is it your view that Democrats want to vote for you, but that there is something rigged about the system that is keeping that from happening?\nSANDERS: No, John.\nWe started this campaign 60 points behind Secretary Clinton. And in the last couple of weeks, a number of the national polls have had us either tied, me ahead a little bit or her ahead a little bit.\nWe have come an enormous way. We are running against the most powerful political organization in United States of America. And I'm very proud of the campaign that we have run. We have won 16 states right now. In almost all of the contests, we win the younger people. By that, I mean not just kids, but people 45 years of age or under.\nI think the ideas we are talking about are what the American people and people in Democratic Party want to hear. We are the future of the Democratic Party. So, I'm very proud of where we are, and we look forward to finding this out through California.\nDICKERSON: One of the issues you have talked about so much is income inequality.\nNPR did an analysis, though, and found in places where income inequality was high, that Hillary was winning in those places.\nYou were asked about this on \"Meet the Press\" and you said, well, poor people don't vote. But in states like Ohio, Florida, New York, and even Michigan, which you won, those who would be--those earning less than $30,000 ended up voting more for Hillary Clinton. So, that doesn't seem to be the case.\nSANDERS: Well, but -- well, first thought, one of the challenges that we have as a nation is that we have one of the lowest voter turnouts in general of any major country on Earth.\nIn the last national election, 63 percent of the American people didn't vote and those numbers were worse for young people and for low-income people. I believe that what we are trying to do in this campaign, John, with some success, is bring people into the political process.\nAnd, obviously, we have got to do better, but I would hope that if I am the nominee that on Election Day you're going to see a very, very large voter turnout. And if that is the case, I think we can change the dynamics of American politics, so it is not just big money interests who help elect candidates through outrageous campaign contributions, but what we have is vibrant democracy where old people participate.\nDICKERSON: But do you still stand by the idea that because poor people aren't voting, that is why you're not winning?\nSANDERS: Well, I think we would -- the fact of the matter is, is that we have low voter turnouts.\nIn New York state, three million independents were ineligible to vote. I think that that is pretty crazy. And I think that, as a nation, we have got to significantly increase the voter turnout. There is no doubt that among low-income people, the voting turnout is quite low.\nDICKERSON: The -- one of the -- in our polls, one of the things we found is that your supporters really want to you continue even if you don't get the number of delegates because you have so affected Hillary's positions on so many things.\nIf that's the case and you were to continue, is there a specific issue or two that you, given leverage you have, would demand that the nominee support that Hillary Clinton is not supporting at the moment?\nSANDERS: Well, John, there's not a question whether if we are going to continue. We are going to continue. We're going to fight this out to the last vote is cast. That's what democracy is about.\nYou can't say to the largest state in this country, California, you can't determine who the nominee will be or what the agenda will be. The basic issue -- issues that we are running on is that we have a rigged economy where the middle class continues to decline and almost all the income and wealth goes to the top 1 percent, that we are not being vigorous enough in combating climate change.\nAnd let me tell you something, because I'm on the Environmental Committee, and the scientists are very clear. If we don't transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy, this planet is in serious trouble for our kids and our grandchildren.\nAnd I got to also add that what we are going to fight for is to end the corrupt campaign finance system by which billionaires of Wall Street and super PACs are able to buy elections. Those are the issues that I think are mobilizing the American people and we will continue to fight for.\nDICKERSON: Yes, I guess what I was asking is whether you will take the fight all the way to the convention and say something like, if you don't get nomination, I would like Hillary Clinton to support that $15 national minimum wage, reinstate Glass-Steagall, come out against fracking more forcefully, make specific requests like that.\nSANDERS: John,that was a very good start. You're doing well. Keep going.\nDICKERSON: So, you would do all that?\nSANDERS: But why don't we throw in the fact -- yes, and why don't we throw in the fact that we are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right?\nAnd we need a Medicare-for-all health care program. We need to guarantee paid family and medical leave. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. All of those issues are issues that I believe that the vast majority of people in the Democratic Party support. I hope that if I do not win the nomination, that that will be part of Clinton's agenda.\nDICKERSON: Your strategist Tad Devine said that if -- after next Tuesday, you may rethink, reevaluate your tone towards Hillary Clinton. What does that mean?\nSANDERS: I have not the slightest idea. You have to ask Tad.\nMy own view is that we are going to debate in a respectful manner the differences of opinions that we have. And we have many differences with Secretary Clinton, as you indicated. I believe the minimum wage should be 15 bucks an hour. She believes it should be $12 an hour.\nI believe that we have got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. I believe that we need a carbon tax, which many of the international financial organizations agree with me on, if we are going to be serious about transforming our energy system and saving this planet.\nI believe in -- my foreign policy views are quite different than Secretary Clinton's, not only that she voted for the war in Iraq, and I opposed it. I have not great fan of regime change, because you have too many unintended consequences. And I do not want our brave men and women in the military to get sucked into perpetual welfare in the Middle East.\nDICKERSON: All right.\nSANDERS: So, I will continue contrasting my views with the secretary's.\nDICKERSON: OK.

It's been a tough week for Sanders, whose chances of beating Hillary Clinton received a near-fatal blow after he was convincingly beaten in the New York primary.\nSanders has vowed to fight on but he needs to win the remaining contests by some big margins to have any chance of catching Clinton at the Philadelphia convention. I sat down with him in Baltimore yesterday and I started by asking him about his differences that still remain with Hillary Clinton.\nTODD: Hillary Clinton, the other night in her victory speech after New York, said this:\n[begin video clip]\nHILLARY CLINTON: And to all the people who supported Senator Sanders, I believe there is much more that unites us than divides us.\n[end video clip]\nTODD: Do you agree with her on that?\nSANDERS: I think there is a lot that unites us. I think there's a lot that divides us. I think the fact that all of us are in agreement that Donald Trump would be a disaster for this country if he became president unites us.\nThe fact that we understand, for example, that climate change is real while Republican opponents ignore that reality unites us.\nBut on the other hand, I think what divides us is the understanding on the part of millions of people who are supporting my candidacy that it really is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.\nWe have to deal in a very substantive way with income and wealth inequality. We need to understand why we're the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people, not to have paid family and medical leave and that we have to deal aggressively with a corrupt campaign finance system, which allows big money interests to buy elections.\nThose are areas, I think, of difference.\nTODD: Well, it's interesting you say they're differences. If she were here, she would say I agree with you on campaign finance. I agree with you on Medicare. I agree with you on --\nSANDERS: No, no, but that's not --\nTODD: She would say she agrees with those goals.\nSANDERS: -- well, we all agree with goals. I mean, I suppose everybody has general understanding, you know, that we don't want to see a nuclear war and so forth.\nBut I think that I believe in a Medicare for all, single-pay or program that guarantees health care to all people. I have not only shown by talk but by walking the walk that you can run a campaign, a strong, winning national campaign, getting millions of individuals to make small campaign contributions.\nThat has not been Secretary Clinton's approach. We have not been dependent on big money interests. And that is perhaps the most important thing because I'm not quite sure that you're ever going to change this country, ever going to take on the billionaire class, ever going to create a government that works for the middle class so long as you're dependent on Wall Street money and big money interests.\nTODD: You wake up the day after the convention and you're not the nominee.\nDo you look in the mirror and say this was a successful campaign?\nSANDERS: Well, obviously, our goal now is, while we have a narrow path to victory, we're going to fight for the -- through that path. We hope to win. But I think the fact that we have shown that there is massive dissatisfaction in this country with the status quo, that people want to think bigger, that people understand that when you have 20 people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom 150 million people, that people are showing in this campaign the desire to stand up and fight back, the fact that we have brought millions of young people, who, I think many of the pundits had thought were kind of apathetic, not interested in politics, well, you know what?\nThese young people know they're the future of this country. They want to shape the future. And I'm very proud that we have been able to bring them into the political process.\nTODD: You just described it as a narrow path.\nSo what it is?\nExplain it to me.\nSANDERS: Well, we're going to have to do -- obviously win big in the number of the primaries and caucuses that yet remain. A poll came out yesterday that had us within striking distance in California, our largest lead. I think we could do very well in California.\nTODD: But it starts with winning some states here, winning a Pennsylvania, winning --\nSANDERS: Well, bottom line, the arithmetic is you have to win delegates. That's what it means. We have won --\nTODD: Well, in this case, it means big primary wins.\nSANDERS: Right. We have won 1,200 delegates. And, by the way, when we talk about the campaign, you know, we started this campaign 60, 65 points behind Secretary Clinton in national polls; now many of these polls have us even, a few points ahead, perhaps. Many of the polls now show us -- and this is an important point, Chuck.\nWhen Democrats look out into the horizon, what unites us is the understanding that Trump would be a disastrous president. Look at the polls. Bernie Sanders runs better against Trump in almost all of these polls than does Hillary Clinton.\nTODD: But she runs well, too.\nSANDERS: She runs well, too. [crosstalk]\nTODD: Does that hurt your cause a little bit?\nIt's like, yes, you do better. But she runs pretty well, too.\nSANDERS: Well, I think the answer is, depending on the polls -- and polls are polls. I don't want to go crazy on polls.\nBut I think many Democrats are convinced that what is most important is defeating Donald Trump. And I believe the objective evidence is that I'm the stronger candidate.\nTODD: I was just going to say, at the end of the day, you feel like you were given a fair shot at this nomination?\nSANDERS: Yes. We took advantage of the opportunities in front of us. We are in the race, we're not writing our obituary. We're in this race until California and we're proud of the campaign we ran.\nTODD: Quite some interesting numbers here. So 17 of the 25 states with the highest levels of income inequality have held primaries; 16 of those 17 states have been won by Hillary Clinton, not by you.\nWhy?\nSANDERS: Well, because poor people don't vote. I mean, that's just a fact. That's a sad reality of American society. And that's what we have to transform.\nWe have what, as you know, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on Earth. We have done a good job bringing young people in. I think we have done -- had some success with lower income people.\nBut in America today, in the last ,election in 2014, 80 percent of poor people did not vote.\nTODD: You feel as if you could find a way to get people that are fighting at that poverty line, either just below it or just above it, if they were getting engaged in the process, you would do better?\nSANDERS: If we could significantly increase voter turnout so that low income people and working people and young people particular in the political process, that if we could have a voter turnout of 75 percent, this country would be radically transformed.\nTODD: President Obama is getting a little bit of criticism in the U.K. for speaking out against -- he doesn't want to see British citizens vote to take the U.K. out of the E.U.\nFirst of all, where are you on that?\nAnd second of all, would you insert yourself into the campaign?\nSANDERS: Well, I'll let the British people make their own decisions on that.\nTODD: So you don't think the president should be commenting on this?\nSANDERS: The president has every right to comment on what he wants. Though I'm a candidate for president right now, I'm not going to --\nTODD: So as president, you would not have --\nSANDERS: I didn't say that. He is the president.\nTODD: Right.\nDo you have a view?\n[crosstalk]\nSANDERS: -- candidate for president.\nTODD: Do you have a view on this?\nSANDERS: Not a significant one. I'll let the people -- you know, I think the U.K. -- the European Union obviously is a very, very important institution. But ultimately, you know, people of Britain have got to make their own decisions. I would hope that they stay in but that's their decision.\nTODD: Why are you against the consumption tax, the soda tax in Philadelphia that would pay for pre-K?\n[crosstalk]\nTODD: Hillary Clinton is for it.\nSANDERS: Yes. I'll tell you why, because it is a totally regressive tax. And right now, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the wealthy are getting wealthier, many of them pay an effective tax rate lower than working people. You have large multinational corporations not paying a nickel in federal taxes.\nThat's where you get the money. Somebody who's making $20,000 a year and they buy a bottle of soda, I don't think you charge them 30 cents more for that bottle of soda. Now the goal of universal health care, universal child care, absolutely something that I strongly agree on and I applaud the mayor there for coming forward.\nBut raise the money in a way that is progressive, not on the backs of low-income or working people.\nTODD: So you must be against cigarette taxes, too, then?\nSANDERS: No, I'm not. Cigarette taxes are -- there's a difference between cigarettes and soda. I'm aware of the obesity problem in this country.\nTODD: I don't think Michael Bloomberg would agree with you on that one.\nSANDERS: Well, that's fine. He can have his -- a point of view. But cigarettes are causing cancer, obviously, and a dozen other diseases and, you know, there's almost a question as to why it remains a legal product in this country.\nTODD: Let me wrap it up, a question this way.\nDo you feel as if, if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee and you're not but Donald Trump is the opponent, do you have a responsibility to do what it takes to get your voters to support Hillary Clinton?\nSANDERS: I will do everything that I can to make certain that Donald Trump is not elected president.\nBut the -- if that's scenario plays out, the major responsibility will be on Secretary Clinton to convince all people, not just my supporters, that she is the kind of president this country needs to represent working people in this country, to take on the big money interests, who have so much power, to fight for what the American people want.\nTODD: Your supporters are, for the most part, whenever I -- very skeptical of Hillary Clinton. Very, very skeptical. Tougher on her, frankly, than you ever are. People talk about all this back and forth.\nWhat do you think -- what is your advice to her on winning your voters over?\nSANDERS: Well, I think she's going to have to be very explicit about supporting a program which stands up for the needs of the middle class and working families, which, most importantly, makes it clear that she is prepared to take on Wall Street in a very clear way, take on the billionaire class, come up with a program that makes health care for all in this country a right within the next several years.\nI think those are some of the issues she's going to have to bring forth.", "timestamp": "2016-04-24", "title": "Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News' \"Meet the Press\""}

The level of poverty is unbelievable. We have to rebuild our inner cities. I think the American people want us to focus on the real issues impacting them, how their kids can afford to go to college, not worry at this point about who is going to be a vice presidential candidate.\nTAPPER: Well, then broadly speaking on those issues, if you don't win the nomination, does Hillary Clinton need an outspoken progressive, someone like you or Elizabeth Warren, as her running mate to motivate your supporters and make sure that those issues you just talked about are on the forefront?\nSANDERS: Well, I think that Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump, whoever became the candidates may be, need to start talking to the real issues facing the American people.\nAnd that is that we have a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. Jake, how often do we talk about on television that the 20 wealthiest people in this country now own more wealth than the bottom 150 million people, that, in fact, we are seeing public school systems, one end of this country, in serious, serious trouble, we are seeing kids graduating college deeply in debt?\nAll of the candidates need to focus on those issues. And vice presidential candidates need to do the same. That's what I'm trying to do in this campaign. That's why we have come from 3 percent in the polls to almost tying or in some cases being ahead of Secretary Clinton in national polls.\nTAPPER: David Plouffe, Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager, who, we should say, is now supporting Hillary Clinton, Plouffe had some strong words for you on Twitter.\nHe wrote -- quote -- \"Sanders has run a stunningly strong campaign fueled by passionate supporters, but raising money stating that you have path to nomination is fraud\" -- unquote.\nWhat's your response to Plouffe?\nSANDERS: Well, my response is that David Plouffe is working for Hillary Clinton.\nThe idea that we should not vigorously contest this election, when the largest state in the United States of America, California, has not yet voted, nine other states will not have voted after Tuesday, of course, we're going to give every -- the people in every state in this country the right to determine who they want to see president of the United States, what kind of agenda they want.\nJake, you know, when we began this campaign, we were way, way behind. And I think it is fair to say that we have the momentum, we have the energy, that we are bringing millions of people into the political process.\nWhat is good for America, what is good for the Democratic Party is to see a whole lot of people debating the real issues impacting our country. That's how you have a large voter turnout. And when you have a large voter turnout, Democrats and progressives win, and Republicans will lose.\nTAPPER: Do you have a path to the nomination, though, sir? In what states can you win so overwhelmingly that you can overtake her ultimately in the pledged delegate count?\nSANDERS: Well, I'm not going to tell you that it's easy, but I think we do.\nWhat polls seem to be showing is that many of the states yet to come, including California, our largest state, we have a real shot to win. And I think, also, there are a lot of delegates out there who are looking at the general matchup, and what they're seeing in polls is that Bernie Sanders is running a lot stronger against Donald Trump than is Hillary Clinton, because we can appeal to a lot of independents and people, not just the Democrats.\nSo, I think we do have a path to victory. I think we have come a very, very long way in the last year, and we're going to fight for every last vote until the -- California and the D.C. primary.\nTAPPER: Senator, President Obama told the BBC today that he does not think the military campaign against ISIS will be completed before he leaves office. There are now around 5,000 U.S. troops fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\nIs the U.S. at war in the Middle East again? And does Congress need to pass a new authorization for use of military force, so that the next president, which could be you, has a clear authority to wage this war?\nSANDERS: Well, I would like to see an authorization.\nThe question obviously is, what is in that authorization? And, Jake, I will oppose any authorization that gives us just a wide-open approach to getting involved into perpetual war in the Middle East. I think the president has done a good job in trying to balance the need to destroy ISIS.\nWe have got to put together a coalition of the Muslim nations. But I voted against the war in Iraq, one of the differences that I have with Secretary Clinton. I will do everything that I can to make sure that our men and women in the military are not sucked into perpetual war there.\nTAPPER: You were asked this weekend about why Hillary Clinton beats you in states where income inequality is most stark. And you responded that -- quote -- \"Because poor people don't vote\" -- unquote.\nIt was, however, Hillary Clinton, not you, who carried Democratic voters with household incomes below $50,000 a year. Clinton carried this group 55 percent to 44 percent across primaries where network exit polls had been conducted.\nSANDERS: Well, let me just say this.\nOne of the reasons I am running for president of the United States is to try to revitalize American democracy. It is no secret that we have one of the lowest voting turnout rates of any major country on earth. And it is also true, in the last general election we had in 2014, 63 percent of the American people didn't vote, and the numbers were worse for low-income people, and the numbers were worse for young people.\nSo, what we have got to do, Jake, is to not only overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, so that billionaires and super PACs are not able to buy elections. We have got to involve people. And it's not easy, because so many people have given up on the political process, including a whole lot of low-income people, where the voting rates are in fact quite low, young people, who are not voting in large numbers.\nOur job is to bring people into the political process, to create a government which represents all of us, and not just the 1 percent. And if there's a thing that I'm trying to do in this campaign, that's precisely what I'm trying to do, to increase the number of lower-income people who are voting, working people who are voting, young people who are voting, revitalize American democracy.\nAnd when we do that, I think we begin to change the dynamic of government in America, where it's not just big money interests who make the decisions, but ordinary people.\nTAPPER: Are you surprised that you consistently lose lower-income Americans to Hillary Clinton?\nSANDERS: Well, I am surprised at how well we have done in this campaign.\nYou know, Jake, if you and I were talking 11, 11-and-a-half months ago, you would not have believed that we would here where we are right now. You would not believe that we have won 16 states at this point, and that we're running very close to Secretary Clinton in general election matchups, and, in fact, we're beating Trump by rather large numbers.\nI'm very proud of the campaign that we have run and the kinds of support that we are getting.\nTAPPER: There is a lot of concern, as you know, about what kind of damage you or Hillary Clinton might be doing to one another.\nOne of your high-profile surrogates, actress Rosario Dawson, invoked Monica Lewinsky at one of your rallies. Do you think it's appropriate for your surrogates to be talking about Monica Lewinsky on the campaign trail?\nSANDERS: We have many, many -- Rosario is a great actress, and she's doing a great job for us. And she's been a passionate fighter to see that we see the increase voter turnout, that we fight for racial, economic, environmental justice.\nWhat our job right now is to contrast our views compared to Secretary Clinton. That's what a campaign is about. My own view is, we should break up the large financial institutions on Wall Street. I'm opposed to fracking.\nAnd, by the way, we just won a good victory in New York state the other day. A major fracking program has been killed. I think we have got to ask the wealthy and large corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes. So, what I will be doing in this campaign is in an issue-oriented way, not by personal attacks...\nTAPPER: Right, but that's...\nSANDERS: ...but by contrasting our view to Secretary Clinton.\nTAPPER: But, yes or no, should your surrogates be talking about Monica Lewinsky?\nSANDERS: I have no idea in what context Rosario was talking about her.\nBut I would hope that all of our people focus on the real issues facing working people and the massive level of income and wealth inequality that we have.\nAnd, by the way, it might be a good idea for all of us, including television networks, to start talking about the planetary crisis of climate change, because the scientists tell us, if we do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuels, energy efficiency and sustainable energy, we should worry about the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren.\nTAPPER: Thank you, Senator. Good luck on Tuesday.\nSANDERS: Thank you, Jake.", "timestamp": "2016-04-24", "title": "Interview with Jake Tapper of CNN's \"State of the Union\""}

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to bid a very warm welcome to the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, here to Germany on this fifth visit, this time to Hannover. And let me tell you that I am delighted to have an opportunity not only to continue our talks, but today is going to be very remarkable day, because we're going to open the Hannover fair together. And the United States of America, this year will be the—or are the partner country.\nThese are turbulent times. I think we would both agree. And we have an opportunity to talk about the whole spectrum of international issues. Our bilateral relations are excellent. We don't need to spend too much time on this.\nBut let me tell you, Barack, that I very much value our candid, open talks that are always based on mutual trust. And we talk about the whole range of issues, and we do so today, as we have done many times previously, and I hope and trust that we shall continue to do so.\nWe used all of these opportunities here to—we used this opportunity here to talk about, as I said, the broader spectrum of international issues, for example, combating terrorism, tackling the root causes of flight, and also the peace process, but also questions on—related to migration in general.\nIn many ways, the European Union is a target for those—or a destination, rather, for those refugees that do not enjoy peace and freedom at home. So Syria loomed large on our agenda. We, together, support the political process that has to be brought forward. We support the Geneva talks. And I am greatly concerned that the cease-fire did not hold these—and hasn't held over these past few days and that there are outbreaks of fights in Aleppo and other places.\nI was able to see yesterday along the border with Syria and Turkey what this means by way of suffering, of distress, of want, for people when there is fighting in their home area. So we want to do everything in order to bring the Geneva talks to a successful outcome.\nWe also talked about Libya, because here it's going to be very important to sustain—support the unity Government there, even though, obviously, it's a very fragile one. We have a very—this, too, is an entanglement of, on the one hand, stability, the problems that we have in—with this new unity—that this new unity Government has to restabilize the situation, but also when we look at Syria, for example, there are enormous migratory flows across the Aegean Sea that are triggered by other developments there.\nI am very grateful that the United States of America are supporting the NATO mission in the Aegean. You're going to continue to do so, I understand. And this in many ways is also a joint European-American effort, a transatlantic mission, and we were at one in saying that all of the security issues on the very doorstep of Europe actually can only be solved, can only be tackled by joint transatlantic efforts. And only in this way can our common security be ensured.\nBut this also means—and here we were also in agreement—that a European agreement is necessary, a German agreement is necessary in many of these issues. And I think Germany over the past few months has demonstrated that we are willing to make this additional effort, to go the extra mile, be it in Iraq fighting terrorism, be it in—on the Syrian issue, be it, for example, in the way that we have become engaged in the mission in Mali and in many other places where we have taken—where we are on missions.\nWe talked about Afghanistan, and Afghanistan, too, needs to be kept on a track which is promising for the Afghani people. We are ready and willing to be militarily engaged, to continue to be militarily engaged. We're grateful to the United States of America for the very great responsibility that you are willing to continue to shoulder. And I think the message to the Taliban needs to be, the international community will not leave Afghanistan in its current predicament.\nWe then, last but not least, also talked about an issue where we are also interested in and where the United States also participate in the Normandy format, namely the solution of the crisis in Ukraine. We stand by the Minsk agreement. We attach the greatest possible importance to these—this agreement being implemented as quickly as possible. We will put a lot of efforts into making this possible in our talks with Ukraine, but also in our talks with Russia. Unfortunately, we still don't have a stable cease-fire. We need to bring the political process forward. And the next few steps we've also discussed very thoroughly.\nTonight economic issues will loom large on the agenda, which is why I don't want to go into the issue of the free trade agreement right now. We will have an opportunity to do so later on. But from a European perspective, let me say this very clearly. It is very helpful in order to allow our economy in Europe to grow. It's important for the German economy; it's important for the whole of the European economy. And if I look at the progress that was made with the transatlantic—the TPP—the Trans-Pacific agreement, I think we all ought to have an interest in speeding matters up. And I hope and trust that the American President will continue to support these negotiations. We should do our bit in order to make this a success.\nSo thank you very much, again, for this visit. And I'm very much looking forward to, well, the other things that are sort of lining up for us today and tomorrow. And I'd like to welcome you on behalf of the German citizens, on behalf of the citizens of Hannover.\nPresident Obama. Well, let me say thank you to Chancellor Merkel for your welcome. It is wonderful to be back in Germany. I believe I'm the first U.S. President to visit and spend time here in Hannover, and our magnificent surroundings reflect the history and beauty of this city.\nIt is always a great pleasure to be back with my friend and partner, Angela. I have valued Chancellor Merkel's thinking and perspective on a whole range of global issues throughout my Presidency. You have been a trusted partner throughout my entire Presidency—longer than any world leader—and I value your judgment. I thank you for your commitment to our alliance and to the values and human rights for which we stand. And I'm grateful for our personal friendship.\nI'm here, at Angela's invitation, for the Hannover Messe trade show. Angela and I will join the opening ceremonies this evening and visit some exhibitions tomorrow. And it's a reminder that the United States and Germany are each other's—among each other's largest trading partners. It's a relationship we have to keep building and nurturing so that we're creating more jobs and more prosperity for our people and keeping our countries competitive in the global economy.\nIn that regard, Angela and I agree that the United States and the European Union need to keep moving forward with the Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership negotiations, which we'll discuss more this evening. In our bilateral meeting, we discussed the importance of boosting economic growth in the euro zone, which is critical to the global economy, including the U.S. economy. Strong growth in Europe is particularly important given the array of pressing challenges, whether its security, defense, migration, or refugees.\nI should add, by the way, that given the urgency of climate change—and the economic opportunities of clean energy—both of our nations have signed the Paris climate change agreement, and we agree that it needs to be implemented quickly. And we also agree, the world has to make concrete progress this year to phase down dangerous hydrofluorocarbons.\nOf course, most of our discussion, as Chancellor Merkel indicated, focused on urgent security challenges. Germany is a vital member of the coalition to destroy ISIL. German aircraft support the air campaign, and German personnel in Iraq are training local forces. German assistance is helping Iraq stabilize and rebuild the areas it liberates from ISIL. And our coalition continues to make progress. Today we discussed additional steps that NATO could take to support the campaign, as well as economic assistance to Iraq that the G-7 could pledge at next month's summit in Japan.\nGermany is obviously a strong partner in international efforts to provide humanitarian relief to the people of Syria and Iraq. We remain deeply concerned about the upsurge in fighting in Syria over the last several days, and we continue to agree that the only real, durable solution is a political solution that moves Syria towards an inclusive government that represents all Syrians.\nGiven the horrific attacks that we've seen around the world—including Paris, Brussels, Istanbul, San Bernardino in California, and on a much more frequent basis, attacks and horrific violence that's taking place in the Middle East—we discussed the importance of maintaining our strong security cooperation.\nIn Afghanistan, we'll continue to help strengthen Afghan forces as they push back against Al Qaida, the Taliban, and ISIL. We'll continue to support the Libyan people and the new Libyan Government as it seeks to extend security across its country.\nWe agreed that the United States and Germany are going to remain very strong counterterrorism and intelligence partners, and we're committed to using all the tools at our disposal to prevent terrorists from traveling and plotting attacks. And that includes improved information sharing between our countries and within Europe. And as always, we'll do so while upholding our values and civil liberties, including the privacy of citizens here and in the United States.\nI want to once again commend Angela for her courageous leadership as Germany and Europe respond to migrants who are desperately fleeing the Syrian conflict and conflicts elsewhere in the region. Perhaps because she once lived behind a wall herself, Angela understands the aspirations of those who have been denied their freedom and who seek a better life. And I know the politics around this issue can be difficult in all of our countries. We did discuss the EU's recent agreement with Turkey, and Angela and I agree that our nations can respond to this challenge in a way that is both humane and ensures our security.\nAnd finally, as we look ahead to this summer's NATO summit in Warsaw, we discussed the importance of keeping the Alliance strong with the investments needed for our collective defense. We continue to augment, on a rotational basis, NATO forces in Eastern Europe, including the Baltic States. As I've said from the very beginning of my Presidency, we have a treaty obligation to defend every NATO ally, and we will.\nBeyond the alliance, we welcome the formation of a new government in Ukraine, which we encourage to continue the political, economic and energy reforms that can deliver progress for the Ukrainian people. Chancellor Merkel, along with President Hollande, have been tireless in pursuit of a peaceful and durable solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. And we agree that all sides need to uphold the commitments they've made and that sanctions on Russia can and should only be lifted once Russia fully complies with its commitments under the Minsk agreement.\nTomorrow, Chancellor Merkel will host our meeting with Prime Ministers Cameron, President Hollande, Prime Minister Renzi, as we discuss the full range of challenges that we face together. And it will be another reminder of how grateful I am for Angela's partnership, and how much the United States values our enduring transatlantic alliance, including with Germany.\nSo vielen dank, Chancellor Merkel.\n[At this point, German Government Spokesperson Steffen Seibert introduced White House Press Secretary Joshua R. Earnest in German, and no translation was provided. He concluded in English as follows.]\nMr. Seibert. Josh, please.\nPress Secretary Earnest. The first question will come from Roberta Rampton with Reuters.\nTrade/Trans-Pacific Partnership/Syria\nQ. Thank you. President Obama, you've made the case many times that T-TIP and the TPP with Asia are modern trade agreements that, kind of, deal with some of the problems or issues that arose with earlier deals. But that message doesn't seem to have resonated. The deals are very unpopular at home, and there were huge protests here yesterday over the T-TIP. And of course, it's a huge Presidential issue—Presidential election issue. So what's your plan to realistically advance the deals? Is it realistic to say you want to get T-TIP done by the end of the year? And at this point, realistically, will TPP, which is at the front of the queue, of course, have to wait for congressional approval until the lame duck session at the earliest at the end of the year?\nAnd, Chancellor Merkel, you said yesterday in Turkey that you favor the creation of a type of safe zone in Syria. And President Obama has said in the past that he opposes these types of zones because, while they're well intentioned, they could require—they would require military force to—on the ground to protect the safety of the people. And I'm wondering whether you're going to try to convince President Obama to rethink his position on these types of safe zones and how you would see them working in terms of enforcing safety on the ground.\nThank you.\nPresident Obama. With respect to trade, I think what you're seeing around the world is, people are unsettled by globalization. And although trade has brought enormous benefits to many of our countries that have been engaged in trade, although, typically, jobs that are produced from exports have higher wages and better benefits than those that are not involved with the export market, people visibly see a plant moving and jobs lost, and the narrative develops that this is weakening, rather than strengthening, the position of ordinary people and ordinary workers, and it's forcing them to compete with low-wage labor. And that, I think, is what drives a lot of suspicion, understandably, of these trade deals. The benefits oftentimes are diffuse, whereas a particular plant or business that feels it's been hurt by outside competition feels it very acutely.\nBut if you look at the benefits to the United States or to Germany of free trade around the world, it is indisputable that it has made our economies stronger. It has made sure that our businesses are the most competitive in the world. And as you see other markets like China beginning to develop and Asia beginning to develop and Africa growing fast, we've got to make sure that our businesses can compete there. Because, at least in the United States, 95 percent of the world's markets are outside of our borders, and if we're not there, present, we're going to have problems.\nNow, the relationship between Europe and the United States is already one of the most robust trading relationships in the world. But what we've discovered is, is that while strengthening labor provisions and strengthening environmental provisions and standards, we can also eliminate a lot of regulatory and bureaucratic irritants and blockages to trade that would allow us to engage in even more trade, sell more goods, create more jobs, and create more prosperity.\nNow, with respect to the politics of it, recent surveys in the United States, for example, showed that, actually, the majority of people still favor trade. They still recognize, on balance, that it's a good idea.\nDuring Presidential elections, it's always tough. When we're in the heat of campaigns, people naturally are going to worry more about what's lost than what's gained with respect to trade agreements. But I am confident that we're going to be able to get this done. Keep in mind, there were people who didn't think that with Trans-Pacific Partnership that we would ever be able to give me the authority to actually move it forward, and we got it done. People didn't think we were going to be able to negotiate with 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific and have a deal that, in fact, does strengthen labor and does strengthen environmental provisions, and yet we got it done. And I think the same is going to be true here.\nI don't anticipate that we will be able to have completed ratification of a deal by the end of the year, but I do anticipate that we can have completed the agreement. And then, it will be presented to our various legislatures, our various parliaments. But at that point, we will have the negotiations completed and people will be able to see exactly why this would be good for our two countries.\nAnd with respect to Congress and Trans-Pacific Partnership, I think after the primary season is over the politics settle down a little bit in Congress, and we'll be in a position to start moving forward. Because I know that we have had a majority of Members in the past who were in favor of this deal. Otherwise, we wouldn't have gotten the authority for me to go ahead and fast-track this agreement. But I think we all know that elections can sometimes make things a little more challenging, and people take positions, in part, to protect themselves from attacks during the course of election season.\nOne thing I do want to say with respect to Syria: We all care deeply about the tragic humanitarian crisis inside of Syria. I live with this every day. I read about it every day. We talk to people who are experiencing suffering or have witnessed the suffering that's going on there. We are in constant communications with Turkey, our NATO ally, in finding ways in which we can resolve this situation. I—as you know, I spoke to President Putin early last week to try to make sure that we could reinstate the cessation of hostilities and make sure that the political process does not unwind.\nBut having said all that, the issue surrounding a safe zone in Syrian territory is not a matter of an ideological objection on my part. It's not a matter of me not wishing I could help and protect a whole bunch of people. It's a very practical issue about, how do you do it? And who is going to put on a bunch of ground troops inside of Syria? And how do you let people in? And who do you let in, and who do you let out? And how is it monitored?\nAnd the truth of the matter is, is that when I go through with my Defense Department—and we've done it multiple times—how a proposal like that might work, as a practical matter, sadly, it is very difficult to see how it would operate short of us essentially being willing to militarily take over a big chunk of that country. And that requires a big military commitment.\nAnd I think that one of the biggest challenges that Angela and I both face is, is that we oftentimes see great wrongs taking place around the world, and we do everything that we can to try to right them, but one of the things I've learned as President is, we have to make sure that whatever it is that we say we're going to do we can deliver. And creating a situation in which we could actually protect all the people inside of Syria, the best bet for doing that is to get this political process on track, a transition on track, so that all the parties can safely lay down their arms and create the kind of inclusive, representational government that Syria so desperately needs.\nChancellor Merkel. I think if you actually follow closely my remarks yesterday in Turkey, you will be able to understand that this is something that I think needs to come out of this Geneva process. It's not something that can be called a safe zone in a traditional way. But when we talk about a cease-fire, is it actually possible to identify certain regions in the course of the negotiations by the parties in Geneva where people can feel particularly safe?\nThis is not about influencing the matter from the outside; it is something that needs to come out of the process itself. Because we have tens of thousands of refugees along the Turkish-Syrian border; we have to send a message to them. There are other regions also where one might think of that. Well, the cease-fire in—as a whole needs to be put in place, but these are areas where there is a particular obligation incumbent upon all the different parties where, for example, humanitarian access can guarantee, where the people don't have to have the impression they have to flee this particular area, as well, have again to go to Turkey or to other areas. But it needs to be part and parcel of the Geneva negotiating process, and not something that comes sort of out of the blue.\nMr. Seibert. Kristina Dunz from Deutsche Presse-Agentur, German Press Agency.\nSyria/German-U.S. Relations/North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nQ. Madam Chancellor, Mr. President, this is presumably your last joint sort of visit, or appearance, rather, here in Germany during your term. If you were to draw stock, what were your best experiences and what were your worst—between Medal of Freedom and NSA affair—if I may call it that?\nAnd, Madam Chancellor, the United States actually wants Germany to do more as regards its military presence within NATO. Are you ready to increase, for example, soldiers and the contingent in order to achieve a deterrence via Russia in the east by locating ground troops there? And should the United States not help more by absorbing, for example, more than 10,000 refugees from Syria this year? And will you see to it that from G-7 in Japan, a G-8 process will evolve over time?\nChancellor Merkel. I have the impression that we're actually quite busy with the conflicts that we need to solve in the world as of today. And we have new tasks all the time on our agenda, so I am not in a position to draw stock now. What you see is a testimony to our close partnership and cooperation and friendship based on mutual trust. And I'm very grateful for this because it helps us to solve international issues.\nGermany—if I look at the term of office of President Barack Obama—in many instances has become a more active partner, I think one can safely say, because we are also threatened, our very own security is threatened, and we realize that we cannot ensure this on our own. We have to do this in our alliance.\nIn certain areas ,we have shouldered a long-term mission that we're going to continue. If I look at Afghanistan, for example, in a way we've had a change of paradigm in the sense that we see this challenge of IS as something that is very acute. So we send weapons into a conflict area. We gave them to the Peshmerga, a completely new step compared to our past policies.\nLooking at terrorist threat against France, for example, we've shouldered responsibility in a mission in Northern Africa, which is also a new thing—well, leaving the Congo mission aside where we spent some time.\nBut if we meet in Germany, if we meet at G-7 or again in Warsaw, we shall have other opportunities to meet, the President and I. We shall address all of these issues. So let me say, for me, the future with the President is much more important than the past right now.\nWe know that we obviously have to make additional efforts as regards our possibilities to defend ourselves. We have to put in more equipment, more personnel. We know the targets that NATO has submitted to us. We think that the whole positioning of our federal armed forces reflects fully the—our sense that we need to shoulder this international responsibility, also, as regards, for example, cyber threats, something that we've neglected to do over the past years. And I think that helps. It helps us to tackle the challenges and to master them. And the cooperation with the United States is indispensable.\nLooking at the larger neighborhood of Europe, transatlantic cooperation within NATO, but also in other fora is absolutely essential for maintaining our own security and safety.\nPresident Obama. Very briefly, I want to go back to Roberta's point. As Chancellor Merkel mentioned, part of the notion of a cessation of hostilities is that the parties to the conflict would carve out areas in which, because the opposition is a signatory to that cessation, the regime agrees not to attack those areas. And she's exactly right. And here there's no space between us—that if we can get the political transition to separate out areas where a moderate opposition that's at the table controls it, that should be a safe area. If it's ISIL or Nusra, that's not a safe area. And that's the concept that we've been trying to build.\nNow, it's been framed in part because the Syrian regime has been cheating, in part because there are areas where Nusra and moderate opposition forces both reside and it's been difficult to separate them geographically. But that concept of ultimately bringing some safety and security within the country is entirely consistent with what we're trying to do in our negotiations. Now, with respect to the U.S.-German relationship and my relationship with Chancellor Merkel, I've said this before, I will repeat: This is as important a relationship as I've had during the course of my Presidency. Chancellor Merkel has been consistent. She has been steady. She is trustworthy. She has a really good sense of humor that she doesn't show all the time at press conferences. [Laughter] She's a little more—she's much more serious in front of all of you—[laughter]. And—which probably serves her well. That's why she's been such a long-lasting leader, because she watches what she says.\nBut if you think about the first time I came here, we were in the midst of a potential collapse of the global economy. And I believe that it was in large part because of our joint leadership, because of Europe and the United States and other partners around the world coming together and having a clear vision, that we were able to stabilize the global financial system. And our two countries now have been able to grow steadily and reduce unemployment and recovered much better than a number of other countries around the world.\nWhen you think about the Paris accord, that doesn't happen unless there's strong U.S.-German cooperation, and making sure that we are arresting the pace of climate change is as important as any issue that we're going to face in the decades to come. Making sure that we're able to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon without resort to war, that occurred because of the partnership of the P-5-plus-1 and the leadership that Angela and others have shown.\nIn Afghanistan, German troops have been vital in us assisting Afghans to defend their own country. In Ukraine, the Normandy process, I think, fair—it's fair to say, works in part because the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Angela and President Hollande to draw a very firm line about the basic principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty.\nSo there's not an issue in which we've worked together where I have not been hugely appreciative of Angela's steady leadership and trustworthiness. And as she noted, although it's true that I will be saying goodbye from this current position in around 9 months, a lot happens in 9 months. Everybody kept on saying to me originally that somehow things would slow down in the second half of my last term. It hasn't happened yet. [Laughter] I seem to be pretty busy. And I look forward—in addressing many of the challenges that we face, including those that we'll discuss at NATO, those that we'll discuss at the G-7, those that we'll discuss at the G-20—to know that I have a strong partner in Angela Merkel.\nLast point I would make, with respect to European defense spending. I think it is absolutely true that, under Angela's leadership, Germany has been more forward leaning on a whole variety of areas.\nI do continue to maintain—and I will say this leading up to the NATO conference and beyond—that given the pressures both from the south and the aggressive posture and enormous spending that we're seeing out of Russia, it is important for all of our NATO members to try to hit the target that we set in Wales of 2 percent of defense spending so that everyone is able to maintain the kind of defense capacity—in part to prevent wars—not necessarily to initiate them, but to be in a position where we can send a strong signal that we can meet our alliance obligations and deal with these new and rapidly emerging challenges that confront Europe, as well as the world.\nPress Secretary Earnest. The second U.S. journalist that we'll recognize is Colleen McCain Nelson from the Wall Street Journal.\nNorth Korea Q. Thank you, Mr. President. North Korea launched a ballistic missile from a submarine on Saturday. Later, North Korea's Foreign Minister told the AP that they will halt its nuclear tests if the U.S. suspends its military exercises with South Korea. Do you view that as a serious overture? And at this point, how do you assess North Korea's nuclear capabilities?\nAnd to Chancellor Merkel, you both have spoken about the strong working relationship that the two of you have. As you look ahead to 2017 and the end of President Obama's term, how do you view the possibility of working with a new U.S. President who has called your refugee policy \"insane\" and has raised the specter of dissolving NATO? [Laughter]\nPresident Obama. I—[laughter]. So, with respect to North Korea, we're still analyzing and assessing with precision the activities that North Korea engaged in over the last several days. So I'll let the Pentagon and our intelligence community debrief everyone once this—we have precise information.\nWhat is clear is that North Korea continues to engage in continuous, provocative behavior; that they have been actively pursuing a nuclear program, an ability to launch nuclear weapons. And although more often than not they fail in many of these tests, they gain knowledge each time they engage in these tests. And we take it very seriously. And so do our allies, and so does the entire world.\nAnd it's for this reason why we have continually mobilized the international community to isolate North Korea, to crank up the sanctions that impose a cost on Kim Jong Un and Pyongyang, and why we've cultivated cooperation with the Chinese to put more pressure on North Korea. And although it is not where we would completely like it to be, I will say that we've seen the Chinese be more alarmed and take more seriously what North Korea is doing, and they have been willing to be more forward leaning in exacting a price on North Korea's destructive behavior.\nIn terms of overtures, we don't take seriously a promise to simply halt—until the next time they decide to do a test—these kinds of activities. What we've said consistently, dating back to the six-party talks, is that if North Korea shows seriousness in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, then we will be prepared to enter into some serious conversations with them about reducing tensions and our approach to protecting our allies in the region. But that's not something that happens based on a press release in the wake of a series of provocative behaviors. They're going to have to do better than that.\nAnd until they do, we're going to continue to emphasize our work with the Republic of Korea and Japan and our missile defense mechanisms to assure that we're keeping the American people safe and our—we're keeping our allies safe.\nChancellor Merkel. As to your question, let me make two remarks. First, I concentrate on the task ahead for 2016. I'm quite busy with that, thank you very much. And I'm looking with great interest at the American election campaign. [Laughter]\nMr. Seibert. The one last question is going to come from Nico Fried from the Süddeutsche Zeitung.\nLibya/Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership/U.S. Presidency/European Migration Crisis\nQ. Madam Chancellor, the President, a few days ago, said that it was a grave mistake not to have had a plan after the intervention in Libya ready. Do you think—feel confirmed by the fact that you abstained from that? And do you feel that you are actually sufficiently supported after this—in your policies after this decision was taken?\nAnd, Mr. President, in Germany, there is very great resistance against particularly those private dispute settlement schemes in T-TIP. And what—are you going to accommodate the Germans? And are you actually envious of the Chancellor that her term of office is actually unlimited, according to our Constitution, compared to yours? [Laughter]\nChancellor Merkel. Actually, but you—[laughter]—I was interested—I was so, listening so interestingly—[laughter]—because I always have this 6 o'clock at the back of my mind. What was your question? Oh, yes, on Libya.\nQ. Do you feel confirmed by the decision you've taken. [Laughter]\nChancellor Merkel. Well, if you take a decision that is different from the decision that one of your friends is taking—it was an abstention at the time—it's never easy, but you still remain friends, and it still remains your joined goal that you're pursuing. Now, what's on the agenda now is something that's affecting us, it's affecting the United States of America, and it's affecting everyone. We need to build up a functioning state in Libya, which is anything but easy. That's why we're working so closely and with such commitment in trying to—strengthening this unity Government, and that's why we're trying to cooperate internationally in order to bring about this goal and not have different goals that we pursue.\nSo, basically, let's look ahead. Let's look at what we want to achieve. Let's try and stabilize this country. It's not easy, not at all, because they have a tribal structure in Libya. They have a very—well, a history very much their own. They have a situation there on the ground that is such that they have never had a national army, never had a functioning state as we know it. So that's everything—all of these things come into the equation—we have to think of when we try to stabilize the country, when we try to strengthen the population there. And we do this together with the United States.\nPresident Obama. First, with respect to Libya, just to—I want to be very clear: I continue to believe that it was the right thing to do for us to intervene as part of a U.N.-mandated international coalition to prevent some of the potentially murderous behavior that Qaddafi was talking about. I do believe that it was important for us to properly plan, prepare, and resource what came next. And I think it was possible for us to do that effectively. I think that we didn't do it as effectively as we should have.\nThat does not negate, though, as Angela said, the importance of us all now investing in making sure that there's a functioning Libyan Government. And the fact that we now have a Government of National Accord, fragile as it is, requires us to do everything we can to encourage it. And this is a conversation I've had throughout my meetings during this trip, whether in Riyadh or London or now here.\nWith respect to the T-TIP negotiations, what you're seeing is differences continually narrowing. And I think it's up to the negotiators to try to find compromises and solutions on all these issues.\nThe issue of dispute settlement is something that has gained a lot of attention and attraction among those who generally oppose trade agreements. Keep in mind that the vast majority of trade agreements already contain such dispute resolution mechanisms. And the terrible scenarios that are painted in which suddenly corporations are going around suing countries so that they are not able to enforce their public health laws or their financial regulations or their environmental laws, none of these things have happened with the many trade agreements that currently exist and that Germany and the United States and the EU and others are already a party to.\nSo I think it's important for us to look at the facts and not a bunch of hypothetical pronouncements. And the fact is that, for example, in the Trans-Pacific Partnership that we've negotiated, you have countries that right now have very few labor rights that now are required to have labor rights and, by the way, can be enforced by workers, the same way that corporations have. You have environmental provisions that now are fully enforceable and that raise standards in countries that may not even have, up until this point, any serious environmental laws in place.\nAnd so if you look point by point, the issue is not whether or not there is going to be trade. The issue is going to be, under what terms. And I believe that countries like the United States, countries like Germany, that already have high standards, that already make sure that how businesses operate are not completely based on profit, but are also based on the common good, that that improves rather than detracts from the kinds of progressive goals that brought me into office in the first place. Otherwise, I wouldn't support these laws.\nAnd with respect to your last question, I do not envy Angela Merkel—[laughter]—for not having term limits. I've said this before. I love this job. It is an extraordinary privilege, and I wake up every day knowing that what I do matters, and that I can help somebody somewhere, both inside the United States and around the world, make the world a little safer, a little more prosperous, help some child get an education, help some disease get cured. It is an extraordinary privilege.\nBut I have come to appreciate, at least in the United States, the wisdom of our Founders. I think it's healthy for a big, diverse country like ours to have some turnover—to use a phrase from basketball, some fresh legs to come in and—or to use another sports analogy, that I run my portion of the race and then I pass the baton to the next person. And my goal between now and the time I leave is to make sure that when I turn over the keys to my office, that the desk is clean, and if the world is not completely tidy, that at least it's significantly better off than the way I found it.\nNow, having said that, I'm glad Angela is still sticking around—[laughter]—because I think the world benefits from her steady presence. And she is to be admired for her remarkable endurance. And I'll—as a private citizen, I will continue to admire her and appreciate the work that she's doing.\nBy the way, what's happening with respect to her position on refugees here in Europe, she is on the right side of history on this. And for her to take on some very tough politics in order to express not just a humanitarian concern, but also a practical concern, that in this globalized world, it is very difficult for us to simply build walls, she is giving voice, I think, to the kinds of principles that bring people together rather than divide them. And I'm very proud of her for that. And I'm proud of the German people for that.\nAll right. Thank you very much.\nChancellor Merkel. Danke schoen.\nPresident Obama. Danke schoen.", "timestamp": "2016-04-24", "title": "The President's News Conference With Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in Hannover, Germany"}

Hello, everyone. Guten abend! I want to thank my great partner and friend, Chancellor Merkel, for inviting me here to Hannover. It is great to be with you at the world's leading showcase for industrial technologies that power our global economy.\nI'm pleased that this year the United States is the official partner country for the very first time. And it is an honor to be the first United States President ever to attend the Hannover Messe. It's also quite a pleasure to be here as Germans celebrate the 500th anniversary of your beer purity law. [Laughter] I will—I may join you in that celebration. [Laughter]\nI'm joined here today by our Commerce Secretary, Penny Pritzker, more than 350 American companies—including more than 200 small and medium-sized businesses—and dozens of economic development organizations from States, cities, and communities across the United States. And I am here, and we are here because we are ready to do even more business with Germany, more business with Europe, and more business with the world.\nIn many ways, this event reflects the larger story of the alliance between our two countries. After the Second World War, much of this city and Europe lay in ruins. But then, together, we set out to rebuild, with the help of the Marshall Plan. Just a few months after that plan was announced, businesspeople and investors from around the world gathered in Hannover, in a factory, to see how they could help spark what would become a German economic miracle. And for nearly 70 years, the world has come to Hannover to experience the technologies that have helped to deliver unprecedented prosperity to people around the world.\nAs President, I've worked to make sure that we are sustaining this spirit of innovation in the United States. We've launched next-generation manufacturing hubs and new online tools to help entrepreneurs start new businesses faster. Over the past 6 years, the United States has created more than 14 million private sector jobs, including hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. And here at Hannover Messe, you will see examples of American growth and ingenuity, including a full, 3-D-printed electric car. Angela, maybe you and I, we can go driving. [Laughter] I'll have to ask Secret Service, but—[laughter].\nBecause we live in a global economy where so much of our economic growth and job creation is fueled by trade, I've also worked to make sure we're trading more with each other. Germany has long been one of our top trading partners, and during my time in office, we've boosted U.S. exports to Germany, and we've increased our bilateral trade by nearly 40 percent to a record $235 billion last year. German investment in the United States now supports more than 600,000 American jobs. And you're selling more of your products to America as well. Last year, for the first time in decades, the United States became the top market for exports of German goods.\nSo we need to build on this success. I want us doing even more business together, more trade, and creating more jobs for our people, which brings me to my first message today, because I know we have companies here from all over the world. As you look around the globe and try to decide where to invest, where to set up shop, I urge you to select the United States of America: \"SelectUSA.\" Of course, I would imagine the Chancellor makes a pretty strong case for investing in Germany, and there are a lot of good reasons for that. But as President of the United States, I've got a pretty strong argument as well. So, Angela, with your understanding, I'm going to give everybody here the best pitch that I can.\nIn the United States, you have access to one of the world's largest markets, more than 320 million people. Our world-class universities and research centers are responsible for more than a quarter of the world's research and development. We've been issuing about 300,000 utility patents a year for new ways to manufacture. Americans are among the most productive workers in the world; manufacturing productivity has surged. We've become more energy efficient, which lowers costs. And with our SelectUSA initiative—cutting redtape, streamlining regulations—it's even easier for companies like yours to come and build in America. That's a pretty good sales pitch. [Laughter]\nWhich brings me to the other message I want to deliver today. The United States and the European Union already have the largest trade and investment relationship in the world. We trade about $3 billion in goods and services every single day. We invest more than $4 trillion in each other's economies. And all that trade and investment supports around 13 million jobs across our countries. That's good news.\nSo what's the problem? As your companies know, there are still too many barriers that prevent more transatlantic trade and investment. Even though tariffs between the United States and the EU are relatively low on average, some products still face high tariffs, very high tariffs—essentially, taxes that make it harder to export and sell. Different regulations, rules, standards—all these drive up costs, keep manufacturers out of markets, or force companies to make different versions of the same product for different markets; duplicative tests and inspections and more costs. Taken together, these barriers are holding us back from even greater trade, investment, and job creation.\nThat's the reason why the United States and the EU have moved forward with the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or T-TIP. I know that trade can evoke great emotions, in all of our countries. Over the years, some workers and families have felt the costs—the localized costs of globalization and automation and jobs shipped overseas—without necessarily seeing or feeling the benefits of trade, which are more diffuse and broadly shared. And these anxieties are real, and at a time of growing inequality in many advanced economies, we have to address them. But the answer is not to pull up the drawbridge and stop trade; in a global economy, that's not possible. The answer is to learn from the past and do trade the right way, with high standards for workers and consumers and the environment. And that's the kind of trade that we're pursuing in this partnership.\nT-TIP will eliminate tariffs, simplify procedures, bridge differences in regulations, and cut redtape, all of which will make it easier to invest and trade, including for our small businesses who create so many of our jobs. And I want to be clear about this. T-TIP will not lower standards, it will raise standards even higher: high labor standards to protect workers, high standards to protect consumers and give them more choices, high standards to protect the environment. And something very important in our digital economies, it will help ensure we have a free and open Internet, the greatest engine for innovation the world has ever seen.\nIt is true, though, that T-TIP has larger, strategic benefits as well. At a time of widening inequality in the world, including in Europe, T-TIP will help encourage growth across the 28 nations of the EU, including southern Europe. At a time when some are questioning the future of European integration, T-TIP will encourage the higher long-term growth Europe needs to create more jobs, including for our young people. At a time when other countries are trying to shape global trade to their advantage, our countries—which make up nearly half the global economy—have the opportunity to write the rules for trade in a way that reflects our values, like rule of law, transparency, and respect for human rights.\nAnd finally, in this time of uncertainty, including here in Europe, when others would use trade and energy as a weapon, T-TIP would help Europe diversify energy markets and increase energy security. So for all these reasons, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership would reinforce our larger transatlantic relationship, which has been the foundation for our prosperity and security these past seven decades. It would bind us even closer and help lift the fortunes of our people, renewing confidence that democracy delivers progress.\nSo in closing, I want to point out that we've now been negotiating T-TIP for 3 years. We have made important progress. But time is not on our side. If we don't complete negotiations this year, then upcoming political transitions—in the United States and Europe—could mean this agreement won't be finished for quite some time. I know the politics are hard. But we have to keep making our case, stating the facts, and dispelling any misperceptions. We can't let this opportunity close. The time to complete T-TIP is now, and I'm here to say that the United States is prepared to make every effort to reach an ambitious, comprehensive, and high-standard agreement this year.\nAnd just as I have demonstrated my willingness to invest political capital back home to expand trade that creates jobs, I call on leaders across Europe to join me and Chancellor Merkel in doing the same. That's how we can sustain the progress that began here in Hannover nearly 70 years ago. That's how we can unleash the next wave of innovation and the jobs that lift up our people. And that's how we can keep strong our transatlantic relationship and a global economy of rules and high standards for generations to come. So thank you so much for this opportunity. Vielen danke. Thank you very much.", "timestamp": "2016-04-24", "title": "Remarks at the Opening Ceremony of the Hannover Messe Trade Fair in Hannover, Germany"}

{"author": "Ted Cruz", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117204", "text": "HOUSTON, Texas - Presidential candidate Ted Cruz penned the following op-ed in USA Today outlining his positive plan for more jobs, higher wages, and greater opportunities for all Americans.\nTax Freedom Day comes way too late\nUSA Today\nTed Cruz\nSunday was Tax Freedom Day, marking the first point in the year in which Americans have earned enough to pay their 2015 tax bill. Four straight months — that's how long it takes for the hardworking people of this country to fund the bloated government.\nIt shouldn't take us a third of the year simply to pay the government, much less spend billions of hours and dollars of our time to do so. According to one study, tax compliance took Americans 6.1 billion hours; another study estimates tax compliance carries hidden economic costs of between $215 billion and $987 billion annually.\n…\nInstead, I have proposed the Simple Flat Tax, which scraps the existing tax code and replaces it with a much simpler, fairer and more pro-growth system. It collapses the existing seven individual rates into one flat rate of 10% for everyone, abolishes the IRS as we know it, and dismantles the Washington Cartel by cutting off their access to the tax code as a political weapon. All Americans will be able to fill out their taxes on a postcard or phone app — in a matter of minutes.\nThe average family will pay no taxes whatsoever on the first $36,000 of income. Individuals will be able to save up to $25,000 per year tax-deferred for any purpose — whether it's saving for college, investing in a small business, or just building your nest egg.\nAccording to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, within a decade the Simple Flat Tax would increase take-home pay by $7,600 for the median household, create 4.9 million jobs, and increase after-tax income by double-digits for all income groups.\nBut tax reform is only one element of our growth platform. In a Cruz administration, we will also audit the Federal Reserve and stabilize the dollar so that we don't set ourselves up for another crash as we saw during the 2008 housing crisis.\nAdditionally, I have laid out a detailed plan for cutting government waste in the Five for Freedom plan, which gets rid of departments and unnecessary agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and returns dollars and decisions back to the states and the people.\nWe will rein in the federal regulators who are stifling growth — starting with repealing Obamacare and replacing it with care that's more personal and accessible. We will halt President Obama's federal agencies from adopting liberal agendas such as the \"Clean Power Plan,\" which raises energy prices for all, prevents companies from hiring more workers and gives more power to the government. We're going to wipe away these costly programs and empower the people to once again thrive and prosper.\nTogether, we will reduce the burdens on every individual, every small business, and every industry so that they will be free to expand and create new jobs. When it comes to energy, we will expand exploration, and pipeline infrastructure - which will create millions of new jobs. When it comes to manufacturing, the Simple Flat Tax is border adjustable, which levels the playing field and makes exports tax-free. That will bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to America. It also allows for immediate expensing of equipment, which is a powerful catalyst for job creation. When it comes to farming, we will get rid of the EPA's overreach and stop picking winners and losers.\n…\nThis pro-growth platform is not a fanciful new idea. We know it works. When President Reagan took office in 1981, his agenda of lower taxes faced strong opposition from the Democratic speaker of the House. But Reagan took the case to the people and they rose up to reform our economy because they knew after Jimmy Carter's term that the answer to growth was not the government — it was just the opposite. And they were right.\nDuring the 1980s, as the late Wall Street Journal editorial-page editor Robert Bartley wrote in his 1992 book The Seven Fat Years, the overall economy grew by 30%, household disposable income increased by 20%, and 18 million new jobs were created.\nThat's the kind of revolutionary growth we can ignite once again if enact fundamental reforms to reduce Washington's power and return opportunity to the American people — the greatest force for innovation the world has ever known.", "timestamp": "2016-04-25", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: CRUZ: It's Time to Ignite Economic Growth and Opportunity"}

EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. It's nice to see you. We've got some special guests at the top of our briefing today. I'm joined by Tom Donohue, who is the CEO of the United States Chamber of Commerce. To his right is Andrew Liveris, who is the CEO of Dow. Both of them are obviously here traveling with the President to attend the Hannover Messe.\nThey are part -- there are a couple of reasons why it's significant that they're here. They're part of the contingent of about 350 U.S. business leaders who are here at Hannover, including about 200 business leaders representing small and medium U.S. companies. So they are a good representation of the U.S. business community's participation in this presidential trip.\nIn addition, both Tom and Andrew joined the President last night for dinner with Chancellor Merkel and other business leaders, and it was an opportunity for business leaders in our two countries to have a conversation about the business climate, and opportunities for expanding business between our two countries.\nSo they'll have some insight on a range of issues. And each of them has prepared short opening statements that they'll deliver. And then I'll call on you and you can ask them whatever questions you would like. After they've concluded, then I'll be joined by my colleague, Ben Rhodes, and he and I can take your questions on other areas of interest.\nSo, with that, Tom, do you want to go first?\nMR. DONOHUE: Well, thank you very much, Josh. And it's very nice to see you all. I'm pleased to be here with Andrew Liveris from DOW, one of America's great CEOs, involved in extraordinary changes in his industry, and you'll be pleased to visit with him.\nLet me begin by thanking the President, Ambassador Froman, Secretary Pritzker and others for making this trip. I was here a number of years ago, and encouraged them to do this because this is an extraordinary opportunity to come together with people from the EU, particularly from Germany, to talk about what we have to do to strengthen our economies and to pass the trade bills that are going to help us do that.\nIt sends a strong message -- their presence -- about the vital importance of the transatlantic partnership, the largest commercial relationship in the world and one based on shared values. No other partnership in the last 70 years has done more to advance global economic growth, establish a robust and fair trading system, and to enforce the democratic opportunity, security and values around the world. Like the President, the U.S. Chamber is here to bolster that relationship.\nLast night, as Josh indicated, we had a great discussion with President Obama and German Chancellor Merkel on these issues and others. Today, the Chamber will also be cohosting a bilateral business summit here at the fair focusing on the importance of the steps we've got to take to shore up our economies and to strengthen the relationship between the U.S. and the EU. And tomorrow I'll be in Munich to pursue these very same arguments with the business leaders there.\nOur primary message on this trip is that the transatlantic relationship is more important than ever, and so is our global leadership in that regard. We may not see eye-to-eye all the time with this administration -- nor should we -- but we stand shoulder-to-shoulder when it comes to advancing job-creating trade agreements like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the TPP.\nThe one that we're discussing here is a once-in-a-generation opportunity not only to boost our economic advantage, but to fundamentally strengthen this relationship. It's going to spur jobs and investment. It's going to reduce needless regulation. It's going to take away barriers, and it's going to help us in a geopolitical way as well.\nLater today, we'll all be filing a joint -- the Chamber and others -- encouragement, a public statement that sort of follows what I just said. We appreciate the President's support of TPP. The demands on the President, no matter whether you agree with him, you don't agree with him, whatever issue is on the table, are unbelievable. And that he took this time to come here was very important, and I congratulate him for it.\nAnd thank you very much.\nMR. LIVERIS: Thank you, Tom. Great to share the podium with you and to take this opportunity to also reinforce the importance of this trip and thank the President for taking the leadership to be the number-one salesman for the United States of America.\nAnd I would say that as a global company with a large presence here in Germany. We have 17 facilities, 14 manufacturing plants, 5,000 employees. It's our third largest country, and we've been here over 60 years. We are as German as we are American. And we believe that the human spirit shifting back on trade as the primary way of seeking to get economic balance around the world -- from all the technologies available to us, whether it be in the United States or Germany, or in the EU, in general -- effective water treatment to energy efficiency, to all the things that we can invent and innovate, this cross-border trading mechanism is key.\nAnd, of course, being here at Hannover Masse, which is the bastion of the civil world of trade and investment, from a German perspective, post-World War II -- we heard from both the President and the Chancellor yesterday in the opening of how important this site was to all things innovation and trade.\nThere is a rich history here, and both the President and the Chancellor referred to it not only in their speeches, but also at the dinner. I must say I sat there in awe of seeing these two great leaders with their two business delegations talking business and government and at its intersections. Because like the Chamber, and like all of us who operate at the intersection of business and government, it's vital that we're at the table, and it's vital that this is a public-private collaboration of which the two leaders sponsor.\nAnd the mechanism to achieve that to the next level for the benefit of all European citizens and American citizens is T-TIP, and getting that through the agenda this year. This is a comprehensive negotiation. It means a lot of hard work. It means to take what Tom talked about to the next level of transatlantic cooperation.\nI heard the President last night say that there is no more important relationship than the Atlantic relationship to the United States of America. This is very true as well on the business side. Why? Because of innovation centricity. These two cultures and sets of countries cooperated through postwar environments, Cold War environments, and now through a trade and innovation environment.\nAnd I'm very proud of the fact that T-TIP has bubbled to the top of the agenda for both the continent of Europe as well as, of course, the United States. The AmCham EU Group did a study that said it could lift Germany's GDP by 0.6 percent if T-TIP was adopted.\nWe have our work to do to talk about the benefits, and I want to home in on two particular benefits. The one, a rising tide lifts all boats. There is no compromise on regulatory standards here. There's dilution of the great EU standards, nor the great American standards, but a harmonization to remove frictions costs, to have these standards speak to each other, to do it in such a way that's transparent so that it can lift exporters of both nations -- Made in America, Made in Germany, Made in the EU as a higher standard.\nWe owe it to humanity that, in fact, we go to the second point on making that happen, which is leadership. Both the Chancellor and the President and, for that matter, all the EU leaders have to embrace this as global leadership. Just like Paris and COP21, there's no more important sense of leadership on trade than trade and investment across borders, and to put transparency in standards to raise the quality of life for all of our citizens.\nThose two reasons are the reasons people like me come to missions like this. It's important to take time out of our agenda to show up and reinforce these two leaders in what they have to do. We have a job to do to communicate. Your job and our job is to allow all of our citizens to understand why this is good for them, why this, in fact, will help them on quality of life, and will help them on increasing wages and making them part of an improving economy, not one that suffers at the hands of trade, as some people are prone to think.\nSo, with that, I'd like to hand it over to Josh, and take Q&A. Thank you, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, Andrew.\nQuestions. Justin, you want to go first?\nQ: Yes, I had a few for you guys. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you see as the likelihood of TPP negotiations -- or the TPP vote finishing this year, and T-TIP negotiations finishing by the end of the President's term. I'm also wondering if there was any discussion at dinner with Chancellor Merkel of Volkswagen and their emissions problems, and how -- well, any discussion on that at all.\nAnd finally, Mr. Donahue, there's news back home the Kasich and Cruz campaigns are now coordinating together to sort of prevent Donald Trump from getting the number of delegates he needs for the Republican nomination. (Laughter.) I know the Chamber has expressed concern over his trade policies before, and so I'm wondering if that's something you endorse.\nMR. DONAHUE: Well, first of all, let me be very clear. Last night there was no discussion of Volkswagen.\nAnd now let's get to the other issues. I think your question we expected, by the way, because we're thinking about it all the time -- is when is the vote on TPP going to happen? Well, as you know, in the Senate, it's going to be the closest vote for Senate in a long, long time, and there are four or five people that are running -- that are in the Republican caucus that would be at risk, perhaps, if they voted for it right now, today. And so I would say that that would -- that vote in the Senate would come after the election. It will come.\nThe vote in the House, with any luck, could be a little bit earlier -- not much. And the reason that I would encourage that is because it will be hard to cram two votes into a lame duck issue.\nNow, let me just say one deal about those votes. In a tough economy, in an election year, nobody is in favor of trade. It seems it's something they can blame on everybody else, and so it's hard to get a vote. But when you do vote a trade bill, what you need is you need to win by two votes -- one vote to win, and one vote in case somebody dies on the way to the vote. And everybody else can be excused from the vote. And we don't care how many we win by -- we only care that we win. And both of these votes will, in my opinion, be held before the end of this administration.\nOn the question of the T-TIP, that will go through the Congress much easier -- much more easily -- because it's a relationship with our largest trading partner who, for the longest time, said to have stronger regulations, more favorable labor regulations and other issues, and with that as an argument, I think we could get that done in a very convenient and more easily passed. But it's going to take a while to get people here and people in the United States focused on doing not a half-baked bill but a really good trade agreement. And I would hope that you'd see something happen there in the next 90 days.\nMR. EARNEST: Other questions this morning?\nYes, this gentleman in the back.\nQ: You just said that last night there were no talks about Volkswagen, so I wonder, what about today?\nMR. LIVERIS: I've heard nothing.\nMR. DONAHUE: I've heard nothing, either. We've been at different kinds of meetings early today, and so we've not been with the President or the Chancellor, or with the leaders of the governments. We'll see more of those people today. I don't expect that while everybody is trying to drive trade and investment we'll hear too much about that.\nMR. EARNEST: Let me just add one part to this, which is that obviously the President is constrained in what he would be able to discuss on this particular issue, given the ongoing legal proceedings. That certainly applies in public, but the truth is, that also implies to his discussions in private, as well. So I certainly can't speak for what kinds of conversations may be going on among business leaders who are here, but I can tell you that the President does not anticipate engaging in discussions about that specific issue, either in public or in private.\nOther questions?\nYes, sir.\nQ: My question is about procurement Buy American -- we had an interview with Sigmar Gabriel yesterday, the German federal minister for the economy, who said there will be no deal on T-TIP if the U.S. doesn't open up their procurement markets. And I guess he means not only on the federal but on the state level. So is there any room in the negotiations actually from the American side to compromise here?\nMR. LIVERIS: I'll answer that by stating nothing specific. There was actually an anecdote at dinner, but, look, operating in 162 countries, we run into buy X all the time, so buy China, and China buy duh-duh-duh. This is one of the biggest non-tariff tariff barriers. So speaking to common harmonization of trade starts to get at those sorts of barriers so that you don't force someone to go build a factory in your home jurisdiction to have the local procurement requirement fulfilled.\nI know, listening to Mike Froman last night, that the Chancellor and the President were urging the two negotiators to get to the details of negotiations yet this summer. And I know that's one of the topics of great import. But nothing specific -- unless, Tom, you had something.\nMR. DONAHUE: The Chamber of Commerce of the United States is fundamentally opposed to the Buy America efforts that are making it more difficult to negotiate really strong trade agreements. Most of that comes from the states -- individual states -- not from the federal approach. And generally, we're able to work those out, even when the states put them in place, because when they find out the problem it creates for their own state, we usually find a way around it.\nBut I think to get a T-TIP agreement we're going to have to pretty much put something in there that codifies that.\nMR. EARNEST: Other questions?\nYes, sir.\nQ: Mr. Liveris, I'm just curious whether you could elaborate a little bit on the anecdote you just mentioned yesterday at the dinner.\nMR. LIVERIS: The anecdote was exactly just -- the leaders were very relaxed. And if I could talk about the ambience of the relationship -- and I've been around it a little bit, not as much as maybe Tom has -- it's an exceptionally good relationship, and it permeated the whole dinner conversation. And I've been part of those sorts of dinners in other forums -- not necessarily between the Chancellor and the President -- but just to see the way it was conducted -- and the Chancellor is just incredible in the sense of her humbleness and her ability to make you feel at home. It was just a perfect hosting event. And there were friendly little jabs at each other about what could be the basis of a T-TIP negotiation. I think this was all done in good humor, so anecdotes occurred. I don't know, Tom, if there was any more to it than that.\nMR. DONOHUE: No, I think that was great.\nQ: Mr. Donohue, I'd like to follow up on Justin's question about the Cruz and the Kasich campaigns and your reaction.\nMR. DONOHUE: I thought I did a good job --\nQ: Yes, I thought I'd give it one more shot.\nMR. DONOHUE: Look, I've been around a long time, and before most other elections you run into people in your business or in your personal life and they'd ask you about the election, and your reaction is, well, you have this view, and the polls said this and this is what you might expect. Quite frankly, we're not sure where this whole thing is going. Will it end up in an open convention? Nobody knows. And there are challenges on the Democratic side, as well.\nI think it's very hard to speculate. It is true that some are trying to figure out a way to head off Mr. Trump. At the rate he is gathering delegates that may be very hard. Anybody that could tell you where this thing plays out in July is a lot smarter than I am. But I would simply say that I didn't have them before, but I now have hotel rooms in Cleveland.\nQ: And I also wanted to ask, when we hear discussion of the way -- the intersection of trade and the election year, it almost sounds as if it's an issue to be put aside if you're a pro-trade person. We have a potential nominee on both sides of the aisle who are against TPP. Is there going to be somebody making a proactive trade case in the coming election year? Wouldn't that help your chances to succeed?\nMR. DONOHUE: We're very involved in that right now at the Chamber, as are individual companies who are spending a lot of time on the Hill now talking about, for example, on the TPP agreement, where this makes a huge difference for them. For example, that agreement is most favorable to agriculture, which in many trade agreements is not the case. It's most favorable to the technology community. It will be very favorable to the pharmaceutical community when -- and we will fix one of the sidebars there. We won't open the agreement. We're not going to renegotiate it. But the history of trade agreements is when you find it all, you've finished it and they write it all down, hey, there are a few things we've got to fix. And that's the case here. And I think you will see some of that.\nThe Chamber, itself, is running a major, major effort with members of the House and Senate, with all of our chambers around the country. We're running events in every critical city with members of the House and the Senate, and we're doing it coincidental with the election on purpose. We're letting them know what we think is important. They can say what they have to say. They have to vote the way we need them to vote, and half of them can take a walk as long as we get two plus one.\nThanks.\nMR. EARNEST: Let me just add one thing to that, Mike, which is that obviously the administration, over the course of this year, is going to continue to make a sustained case about the value of an agreement like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And certainly when President Obama or other Democrats on Capitol Hill who have been supportive of this process are prepared to make a case, they have a strong one to make -- particularly to Democratic constituencies that often have not traditionally supported these kinds of agreements.\nAnd the reason for that is that this agreement doesn't just cut taxes on 18,000 American goods in some of the most economically vibrant countries in the Asia Pacific region, it also lives up to the kinds of values that Democrats and progressives have long advocated for. This includes historically high standards when it comes to the environment and human rights and labor.\nAnd that's the argument that you've heard the President make before and you will hear him make over the course of this year, that if you are a Democrat who is concerned about labor standards in Southeast Asia, for example, that should make you a strong advocate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because this is the kind of agreement that will raise those standards and hold those countries accountable for meeting those standards if they want to be a part of the agreement and if they want to have access to the U.S. market.\nThat is exactly the kind of common-sense, proactive approach that the President is taking to ensure that our country and our workers are sufficiently prepared to confront the forces of globalization that are only going to increase moving forward.\nJustin.\nQ: Can I just follow on something Mr. Donohue said -- actually, it's for you, Josh -- on biologics, I think was the reference that you made. There's been a lot of questions on Capitol Hill about what the administration is going to do and if the biologics issue is going to be settled in some way. Do you have any insight? You seemed to indicate that there was going to be some change happening. Is that the administration's position?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can just say is that as it relates to the TPP generally, there are a number of conversations that we're having with both Democrats and Republicans about the most effective way to move the agreement forward in Congress. And we're going to continue to consult with the leadership as it relates to our vote-getting strategy. We certainly are also engaged on the substance. It's not just about the process, but also on the substance. And there are a number of members of Congress who have demonstrated an interest in particular areas of the agreement.\nWhat Tom said is true. The agreement is not going to be renegotiated. We have spent years -- and you've covered this, so you have a good sense of how we've spent years trying to get 12 different countries with a wide variety of economic interests around the table to find common ground on these issues, and we've succeeded in doing that. And we've done that in a way that represents our interests both as a country that's looking to expand and grow our economy, but also as a country that stands for values that are critically important that we're looking to defend all around the world.\nSo I don't have details of those conversations to share, but we certainly are interested in working in bipartisan fashion on Capitol Hill to build bipartisan support for this agreement. We certainly believe that it deserves it.\nOther questions for the two business leaders while they're here?\nOkay. Gentlemen, thank you for your time today.\nWith that, we have a little bit of a time crunch that's related to the President's speech, so, Desiree, I'm going to be counting on you make sure that we stay on time here. But if you guys have questions on other topics, Ben or I can answer them for you.\nYes, sir, in the back.\nQ: -- the U.S. administration is trying to increase the number of ground forces in Syria. Can you comment on that?\nMR. RHODES: Sure. Over the course of the last weeks and months, as we pursue the counter-ISIL campaign, what we've done is where we see that there are efforts that are making progress, we are willing and committed to accelerating those efforts. And if that demands additional resources, we will provide them.\nSo, for instance, last week, we announced additional support to the mission in Iraq in terms of some specific equipment, including Apache helicopters that can make a difference for Iraqi forces on the ground, a substantial amount of support to the Kurdish forces who are fighting in the north so that they have the budgetary basis to continue to make progress against ISIL, as well as a U.S. role in supporting Iraqi forces who are on the offense through our Special Forces capability in Iraq.\nToday what the President will be announcing is his decision to introduce 250 additional U.S. Special Forces into Syria. This brings the number of U.S. Special Forces in Syria to roughly 300.\nWhat we've seen is the small team that we put into Syria several months ago has been very effective in serving as a force multiplier because they are able to provide advice and support to the forces that are fighting against ISIL on the ground in Syria. And we've seen across parts of northern and eastern Syria progress as ISIL has been pushed out of some strongholds.\nWe want to accelerate that progress, and we believe a commitment of additional U.S. Special Forces can play a critical role, again, as serving as a force multiplier and helping to organize those local forces that are fighting against ISIL on the ground. They will be the ones in the fight, not the U.S. Special Forces. But our Special Forces, again, can provide critical expertise and make them more capable as they have demonstrated that they can take back territory from ISIL.\nQ: Does local forces mean that Kurds in the north of Syria, or other places as well?\nMR. RHODES: So we don't, as a matter of practice, specify the specific geographic area that U.S. Special Forces may be present in. What we have said is that we have worked with both Syria Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who have been fighting against ISIL. So, again, it's not simply Syrian Kurdish forces; there's also a Syrian Arab force that we have been working with on the ground. And we've seen them making progress in areas along the border in north and eastern Syria and the area of -- well, I'll leave it at that.\nQ: Can you talk a little bit about how this announcement figures into the President's speech today, and also the meeting he'll have with the Quint leaders today -- if the remarks are going to be focused on this multilateral approach? Is that something he's also going to seek additional commitments from the other countries as well?\nMR. RHODES: Sure. First of all, I think we're at a moment where we have seen the relentless nature of our campaign against ISIL has begun to bear significant results in terms of taking back territory. And we've been committed to providing the resources necessary to continue to get this job done.\nAnd so the Syria announcement today, coupled with the announcements that we made regarding our support to Iraq in recent days, I think indicates exactly the model that we see working, which is airpower from the coalition, arming, equipment and training from the coalition, and, as needed, a Special Forces capability that can help them make progress on the ground.\nSo I think the President will put this in the broader context of what we see working on the ground against ISIL. He will also make the point that just as we are willing to commit more to the fight against ISIL, we think it's important that our allies are also committing more to the fight against ISIL. We've seen them do that in recent months. We've seen increased contributions to the air campaign in both Iraq and Syria. We've seen support in terms of financing and arms and training for forces that are fighting on the ground in Iraq.\nBut again, we do believe that as we see what works, that there are additional things that our coalition partners can do. And that's something that he'll talk about publicly and privately -- again, with the spirit that everybody is in this fight and we have had important contributions from our European allies. But again, as we diagnose what is working, we see areas where we can provide additional support, and as we see challenges that emerge we want to make sure that we're providing support.\nHe had the same message, frankly, at the GCC summit recently in Saudi Arabia where those coalition partners can also support our mission in a variety of ways. So, yes, I think his point will be, we will do our part, but this will only succeed if we are working together as a coalition and as a global community to stamp out the threat of ISIL.\nQ: I'm wondering if you can just kind of talk about -- obviously the President has stated that there would not be ground combat operations, and a kind of a sticking point was Special Forces -- if you can provide any more clarity on why these are not combat troops, especially since the Pentagon has referred to them as such. And when we brought up this issue I think back in October, whenever the 50 first went in, Josh, you said that if you were envisioning a ground combat operation we would see more than 50 Special Forces. We've quadrupled that number now, so is that the transition that's happening here?\nMR. RHODES: Let me be very specific about this, Justin. Obviously any Special Forces troops that we deploy into Iraq or Syria are going to be combat-equipped troops. They may be in circumstances where they find themselves in harm's way because these are dangerous places. The question is, what is the mission that they're being given? And the mission that they're being given is not to go into Syria and to engage the enemy, to engage ISIL. So they're not being sent there on a combat mission; they're being sent there on a mission to, again, be advising, assisting and supporting the forces that are fighting against ISIL on the ground.\nAnd again, that's rooted in our belief that ultimately, lasting progress and the ability to push back ISIL and to hold territory that's reclaimed from ISIL is going to have to depend upon those local forces. So, yes, any Special Forces capacity that we put into a country like Iraq and Syria is going to have a combat capability, but our point has been that their mission is not to be out on patrol or out to engage the enemy, it is to support these forces that have been doing the fighting.\nAnd I think the proof of that is in what you've seen, which is that over the course of the last several months, the forces that have been fighting in Ramadi and Sinjar and Kobani in northern Syria have not been U.S. forces. They have been Iraqi and Syrian forces that have been taking the fight to ISIL, again, with the exception, of course, of when we have a leadership operation which we have shared with you all.\nOn numbers, specifically, what was the question?\nQ: Yes. Well, Josh said that if you were envisioning combat operations?\nMR. RHODES: Well, I think it's -- yes, it's in numbers and nature of the troops. And again, even a number like 300 Special Forces, we're saying they're there on a support mission for those forces fighting on the ground. We're not deploying ground combat units to be out on patrol in places like Iraq and Syria.\nAnd in order to have, again, a U.S. ground combat mission in one of those two countries, it would be substantially more than we have today. What you see is we have roughly just over 4,000 troops deployed in this theater now, but they're dispersed in difference places. They're dispersed among different Iraqi forces and Syrian forces that we're supporting. In Iraq, they're in different bases and facilities. In Syria, again, we don't comment on their location, but they're in that support role.\nSo we're not deploying large ground combat units to take the place of those local forces. And again, I think the proof that we've been consistent in that point is that anybody who has been following the progress of this campaign can see that the forces that have been fighting on the ground are the local Iraqi and Syrian forces.\nQ: And the last one on the speech. A lot of people described it as a bookend to the speech in Berlin eight or nine years ago. I know that you wrote that one, so I'm wondering if you can talk about some of the parallels or how you see this as sort of a partner or pairing to that speech.\nMR. RHODES: Sure. That does seem like long time ago. But first of all, what I'd say is it's important that we're giving the speech in Germany in both cases. Germany is both at the center of Europe and the center of the European project, and it's also a demonstration of the value of the transatlantic alliance, and a demonstration of what nations can do together when they sustain a commitment to shared security and shared values.\nThe point that the President made in the Berlin speech is that when the world stands together and acts through collective multilateral action, we will be able to deal with the challenges that confront us. And I think that the last seven years bear that out. If you look at the areas where we've been able to make the most progress in our foreign policy, it's in areas where we've been able to mobilize collective action, particularly including our European allies. That was necessary to get the Iranian nuclear deal. That was necessary to stamp out Ebola. That was certainly necessary to get to the Paris climate accord.\nSo what we've seen is when we're working collectively, we can make progress against these challenges. Now, as the President was coming into office, those challenges included the fact that we were on the verge of a global financial crisis that hit right after his Berlin speech. Again, it was collective action -- including very close coordination with Angela Merkel -- that helped us climb out of the global financial crisis.\nToday, what he'll say is that we're dealing with a set of challenges from migration, from the civil war in Syria and ISIL and from Russian aggression. And if you look at each of those issues, they, too, require us to work together so that each of us is bearing our share of support for refugees, so that all of us are doing our fair share against ISIL, that we're sticking together in standing up to Russian aggression.\nSo, once again, he'll be making the point that we should not go it alone, we should not walk away from the values and institutions that allowed us to make such progress. We should be redoubling our efforts to work together to confront those challenges. And again, here in Germany at a time when there are lots of questions that you've all covered over the course of this trip about the European project, about European unity, I think the President is coming as the strongest ally of Europe to say that we have complete confidence in Europe's ability to deal with these challenges; that Europe itself has demonstrated over the years that it's more than capable of rising to the occasion when it works with us, when it works together as a European Union, and when we are both committed to the values that we've stood for since World War II.\nQ: Do you expect any new initiative or pledge to fight ISIS in Libya as well, sustaining the Government of National Accord? And on immigration issue, giving them NATO assets?\nMR. RHODES: So with respect to Libya, we've been concerned about the ISIL presence. We don't see it on the scale that we have in Iraq and Syria. But we do believe that the most important effort right now is to support the Government of National Accord so that there can be some governing authority in Libya that's been missing over the last recent years, even as we're also going to have targeted counterterrorism efforts when we see an ISIL target that needs to be taken off the battlefield.\nI do think Libya has been a feature of the discussion that the President has had with each of the leaders along this trip. At the Gulf summit, with Prime Minister Cameron, yesterday with Chancellor Merkel. I'd expect Libya to be one area of focus of the Quint meeting today. I think that there will be discussions about how to support that Government of National Accord, what are the different resources that can be brought to bear from Europe and the United States.\nThere will be discussion of what are the counterterrorism concerns regarding ISIL in Libya. But also, there will be a discussion of the refugee flows and what are the best ways that we can work together to manage and deal with those refugee flows. We're certainly doing that, of course, in the Aegean.\nI think more broadly, we will want to be making the point, as the President has done in his meetings, that as we get to the NATO summit in July, we'll be wanting to look at how we are reinforcing NATO's eastern flank through our reassurance effort in the face of Russia's aggression. We also want to make sure that we're reinforcing our southern flank. And that's something, of course, that Prime Minister Renzi has raised repeatedly, and President Obama certainly agrees that NATO has to make sure that it has a strategy and resources that are dedicated to supporting all of our allies, including our southern allies.\nQ: Two questions, one on Syria. Obviously, the President has talked a lot about wanting to have less of a footprint in terms of a military presence in general. I wonder if you could just offer a little more insight about how he weighs that against the decision to send more personnel into Syria. And more broadly, he talked on Saturday a little bit about his legacy, and I wonder how he would assess his foreign policy legacy at this point, just whether he's been able to kind of effect the change around the world he thought he would be able to in his presidency.\nMR. RHODES: Those questions are somewhat related. I think, to your first question, it's important to remember when he spoke in Berlin in 2008, the United States had 180,000 troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. We were, for all intents and purposes, providing the security in those countries. We were losing troops at a tragic and regular pace in both of those countries. And the war in Iraq had dominated American foreign policy.\nWe have significantly changed the nature of American foreign policy over the course of these last seven years so that it is not overwhelmingly focused on a project like the war in Iraq that we believe had distracted us from the fight against terrorism and many other global priorities, and it is now addressing a much broader set of issues in regions.\nSpecifically on the footprint issue, again, we are fighting terrorism because we always said -- and we said back in 2008 -- that we would be relentless in pursuing strategies to root out terrorist networks. But we're doing it in a different way. As I said, we have just over 4,000 U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. We've got just under 10,000 in Afghanistan. That's significantly lower; that's a fraction of the 180,000 that were there when the President took office. And, importantly, their mission is very different. They are in a support role. They are conducting airstrikes through our air campaign. They're supporting local forces who are doing the fighting on the ground and who are on the front lines. And that is a different model from what we were pursuing when the President took office.\nSo even as we are still engaged in these conflicts, and even as we are relentless against terrorist networks, we have been able to significantly reduce the number of American troops in harm's way, the resources that we have to dedicate to those projects. We've been able to build a large coalition to go against ISIL, which I think brings together well over 60 countries in a demonstration that this is not simply an American effort.\nSo we've changed the way that we fight terrorism, and we've been able to do so in a way that reduces the risks and the resource allocation for the United States while still being able to take terrorists off the battlefield. And, frankly, we think it's more effective in the long run, because the only way you're going to get lasting security in these places is if local forces take the initiative, because even when we did have these large ground forces deployed, we were still seeing a continued sectarian violence fighting in the presence of terrorist networks.\nTo your second question, I think if you look at the Berlin speech and you look at what the President wanted to get done when he came into office, we have been able to effect a significant amount of change around the world.\nFirst of all, the United States has been able to resolve the most pressing nuclear nonproliferation concern that we had when we came into office. We've been able to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And we've been able to do so without going to war, because we've reprioritized diplomacy, just like the President said that he would. It took nearly seven years, but we were able to peacefully get Iran to significantly roll back its nuclear program. That makes us safer; it makes the world safer.\nWe reengaged on international climate negotiations, where the United States had been absent when the President took office. He committed to do that when he came to Berlin in 2008, and here we are today with the most ambitious international climate accord that has ever been agreed to. And that to do very much to U.S. leadership in bringing along China and other nations behind an ambitious set of targets.\nWe've also, even as we've maintained a significant focus on the Middle East -- as you've seen during this trip -- and on terrorism, been able to rebalance our focus to other regions of the world. So in the Asia Pacific, we've been able to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, and we've been able to significantly increase our diplomatic engagement and presence and what we believe is one of the most important emerging regions of the world. In Latin America, we've been able to transform our position through the opening to Cuba.\nSo what the President talked about when he came into office -- prioritizing diplomacy, working with allies, building collective action to deal with the challenges of our time, and addressing issues like climate change that had not been on our foreign policy agenda -- I think we've been able to follow through on those commitments.\nThe fact of the matter is, it's a dangerous world, and so there are always going to be challenges. And we continue to face challenges from terrorism, from migration, from Russia, as I mentioned. But the approaches that worked the last seven years are the approaches that need to be applied to those issues and, again, building coalitions, doing our fair share but making sure that we're working with others to see that they're bearing their share of the burden as well, and staying true to the values that the U.S.-German and U.S.-European alliance has stood for for decades.\nMR. EARNEST: Thanks, everybody. We're going to bring this to an end and listen to the President's speech.\nEND 10:38 A.M.

And when this whole campaign began, there were more than 20 candidates in the race. And if you took bets when it began on who the last five would be, a lot of people would have lost money. And one of the reasons they would have lost money is the man I can introduce right now.\nIt's my great pleasure to welcome senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders. [applause]\nHow are you, Senator? [applause]\nDoes this -- does this happen everywhere, like when you go to get coffee now or is that... [laughter]\nSANDERS: [inaudible]\nHAYES: Yes.\nUm, we're here in Pennsylvania. You've got five states tomorrow. Those five states are -- are Northeastern, Eastern Seaboard states. They're not the deep South, where you had a hard time. They're not the Plains States, where you had some real good wins.\nUm, how do you feel about tomorrow?\nSANDERS: I feel pretty good. I think if the turnout is high, if -- if working people come out in large numbers, if young people come out, I think the message, Chris, that we are bringing forth, that it's too late for establishment politics, that it is insane that today, almost all new income and wealth has gone to the top 1 percent, that we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave, not to guarantee health care to all people, that is a message resonating in Pennsylvania, it's resonating in Connecticut, it's resonating all over this country.\nHAYES: [inaudible] [applause]\nHAYES: The primary calendar, uh, June 7th is a big date. It's the California and some other states.\nSANDERS: Right.\nHAYES: The 14th is DC.\nSANDERS: Right.\nHAYES: As of the 14th, everyone will have voted...\nSANDERS: Right.\nHAYES: -- in the territories. Right now, you're at 45 percent of pledged delegates, Secretary Clinton is at 55 percent. She's got about 2.7 million more votes.\nSANDERS: By the way, that's not quite accurate, because I think a lot of the votes cast in the caucus states have not been counted and we've won some of those states by 70 percent.\nHAYES: But you would agree that she's won more?\nSANDERS: Yes.\nHAYES: On the 14th, um, do you agree that the person who's won the most pledged delegates and the most votes is going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party?\nSANDERS: This is what I believe. Now, I know the media has got into all of the process issues. What this campaign is about is transforming the United States of America. What this campaign is about is bringing millions of people into the political process. And I'm very proud of the -- the fact that we have had [inaudible] to do that.\nNow, at the end of the process, you know, frankly, if we are behind in the pledged delegates, I think it's very hard for us to win. But I think we are going to make the case, also, that if you look at the polling and if you look at reality, I believe -- and I'm not the only one who believes this -- that we are the stronger campaign in taking on Donald Trump or any other Republican candidate. And I think that most of -- most Democrats out there, more than anything -- correctly so -- want to make sure that some right-wing Republican doesn't become president of the United States. [applause]\nHAYES: Let me ask you about that because... [applause]...and I -- I sort of share your feeling about process, frankly. I mean I know the...\nSANDERS: My response is then let's now talk about process all afternoon.\nHAYES: Well, but -- but -- right. On, and I agree. But -- but there's also a principal aspect to it.\nSANDERS: Yes.\nHAYES: I mean the -- the principle is Democrat control of the Democratic Party...\nSANDERS: Right.\nHAYES: -- in the sense of you want the person who got the most votes to be the nominee.\nSANDERS: Look, you also -- let's talk about principles. Hundreds and hundreds of super delegates, parts of the Democratic establishment, voted for Hillary Clinton...\nHAYES: Right.\nSANDERS: -- or pledged to come on board her campaign before I even announced my candidacy.\nHAYES: Right.\nSANDERS: And those people have a right to rethink the decision that they made. And if they conclude, for a dozen different reasons, that we are a stronger campaign -- and by the way, this is not just talking off the top of my head, virtually every poll that's out there, as you know, shows that Bernie Sanders is better against Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton because nobody gets other Republican candidates.\nShould that be taken into consideration?\nYes, I do. I think so.\nHAYES: How hard do you see yourself pressing that case?\nSANDERS: Look, again, the issue to me right now is we've got five states tomorrow, if -- we've got 10 remaining states, including the largest state in this country. And what I'm going to focus on is the burning issue facing the American people that we have got to talk about.\nWhy is it that the middle class has been declining for the last 35 years?\nAre we happy that 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.\nAre we doing enough to address the crisis of climate change and make sure that the planet that we leave our children and grandchildren is a healthy planet.\nAre we happy with the corrupt campaign finance system, which super PACs and billionaires are buying elections.\nThose are the issues that we have got to focus on.\nHAYES: One of the... [applause]...one of the sort of sources of your -- of your -- your critique, right, when you talk about why the system is broken, um, has to do with an answer you gave to my colleague, Chuck Todd, about turnout in states and, um, you said something about, you know, a -- lower voting turnout of poor people, right?\nSANDERS: Yes.\nHAYES: And -- and you got some heat for that. It is [inaudible]\nSANDERS: Why did I get heat on it?\nPoor people...\nHAYES: A...\nSANDERS: -- voted for -- voted [inaudible]\nHAYES: Right. [crosstalk]\nSANDERS: Look, let's be clear, this is the [inaudible]...\nHAYES: And that -- and it explains a lot, right?\nSANDERS: Let's be clear, the Clinton campaign has a super PAC. They have 30 people on the Internet who pick up on everything and then they create this kind of, you know, narrative.\nHere is the facts, all right, dispute it if you want with me. In the last election in 2014, 63 percent of the American people didn't vote.\nHAYES: Right.\nSANDERS: It's not a very vibrant democracy, to my mind. Eighty percent of young people, and as I understand it, 80 percent of low income people did not vote. That's a fact.\nHAYES: Right.\nSANDERS: All right?\nSo what was my point?\nLow income people are not voting in large numbers. I think that's a tragedy. I want to see if we can change that.\nHAYES: That -- that brings me to what...[applause]...ultimately you set up -- you set up this campaign that, in some ways, cast its own [inaudible], right, because the -- the campaign is about this political revolution, as you say. It's about breaking down the barriers of who does and doesn't participate.\nSANDERS: This campaign is about...\nHAYES: You said...\nSANDERS: -- taking on the entire establishment, the Democratic establishment, the financial establishment and in Clinton's campaign, the most powerful political organization in the United States of America.\nThis campaign is about starting off 60 points behind Secretary Clinton and, by the way, in the last couple of weeks, a few polls had us ahead of her nationally.\nAll right, that's what this campaign is about. [applause]\nHAYES: What have you learned, then, about what you've succeeded and failed at when you think about turning out precisely the kinds of people that don't -- that under vote in American politics?\nSANDERS: I think it's very difficult. I think there are -- and this is a real American tragedy. There are millions of people, working class people and low income people who turn on the television and you know what they see?\nNothing being talked about the reality of their lives. They listen to what goes on in Congress, they can't for -- afford to feed their kids. They can't pay for their electric bills because we have 47 million people living in poverty. And they see Congress debating tax breaks for billionaires and candidates taking huge sums of money from the wealthy and the powerful.\nAnd they conclude -- and it's kind of hard to argue with them -- that the system is -- the political system is corrupt. And they are saying and candidates taking huge sums of money from the wealthy and the powerful.\nAnd they conclude -- and it's kind of hard to argue with them -- that the system is -- the political system is corrupt. And they are saying to themselves, why do I want to participate in this charade?\nNow, we are trying -- and we've had really good success with young people. I think we're bringing out a whole lot of young people, to some degree with working class people and maybe with low income people.\nBut it is very, very hard to tell people who are struggling now and seeing almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent, that they should get involved in the political process, that their voices actually matter.\nHAYES: So there's -- there's other folks, um, who have been running -- talking about some of those same things. Um, you've -- you've endorsed a few of them, raised money for a few of them.\nThere's a guy here in -- in Pennsylvania named John Fetterman. He's the mayor of a town named Braddock. [applause]\nI had him on the show, an interesting guy. The town has had a really hard time because of trade, because of the steel industry essentially dying.\nHe endorsed you. He says he feels basically like he's a -- sitting there without a -- with a corsage, waiting for the -- [inaudible] the Sanders mutual endorsement.\nSANDERS: Well, I -- I honestly don't know John and I've heard just a little bit about him. Um, what we are trying to do now, we have endorsed and gotten some money to some candidates and I hope they win. I just don't know enough about, uh, John, to be honest with you.\nHAYES: Um, there's -- this -- this connects to another question people have, which is about this movement that you've built.\nSANDERS: I haven't built it. This is a movement of millions of people who are beginning to stand up and fight back.\nHAYES: But you've -- you've facilitated [inaudible]\nSANDERS: I am the candidate for president that many of them...\nHAYES: Right.\nSANDERS: -- are supporting.\nHAYES: Right.\nSANDERS: Yes.\nHAYES: And so then the question becomes, to a lot of people, you know, you -- look, a year ago, I don't -- you were not a Democrat, right?\nYou -- now you are one of the most powerful Democrats in America.\nWhatever happened after that?\nWhatever happened?\nYou've raised more money than anyone ever, right?\nSANDERS: No, I've raised more money than anyone ever?\nHAYES: Up to this point, you are [inaudible]...\nSANDERS: Oh, you mean...\nHAYES: -- in primary hard dollars.\nSANDERS: -- no, Hillary Clinton -- Clinton has raised more money than we have. She has a couple of super PACs [inaudible]...\nHAYES: Right. In hard -- in hard dollars, and particularly in small donors, right, you've done [inaudible]\nSANDERS: We have -- this is -- let me be very clear about this. I am enormously proud. This campaign, our campaign, does not have a super PAC, does not want a super PAC. What we have done is received over seven million individual campaign contributions, averaging $27 apiece.\nI am enormously proud of that. [applause]\nHAYES: So the question then is...[applause]...we have seen before, um, campaigns -- we have seen before campaigns that were able to ignite, uh, tremendous passion from folks, volunteer, knock on doors, give money, right, because of all of the things you're talking about.\nSANDERS: Yes.\nHAYES: And then the campaign goes away and what do you say to those folks that are supporting you about what endures from this, no matter what happens...\nSANDERS: Well...\nHAYES: -- in this outcome?\nSANDERS: -- what I would say, for a start, it will be a lot easier for us to mobilize and endure if I am elected president of the United States [inaudible] [applause]...because this is why. [applause]\nAnd every day I say this, Chris, and I suspect you've heard me say it more than one, and that is that no president, not Bernie Sanders or anybody else, can transform this country in the way we have to transform it, because of the power of the big money interests. Wall Street has an endless supply of money. Corporate America would shut down a plant in Pennsylvania tomorrow if they can move to China and make another five bucks. The corporate media very much determines the kind of conversation we have.\nYour particular station is owned by whom?\nHAYES: Comcast.\nSANDERS: Comcast.\nHAYES: NBC Universal.\nSANDERS: There we go, one of the more popular corporations in America.\nHAYES: Yes. [laughter]\nSANDERS: And -- and, you know, and you've got wealthy campaign contributors. And the only way -- and let me -- let me repeat it again -- the only way we transform this country, and this I believe from the bottom of my heart -- is when millions of people stand up, fight back and demand that we have a government that represents all of us, not just the 1 percent. [applause]\nHAYES: So we've got some great folks here, uh, in the audience. We're going to take some audience questions.\nThe first comes from David Zakubuwetz (ph).\nHe's a 20-year-old U Penn student who supports you.\nDavid?\nSANDERS: Hi, David.\nDAVID ZAKUBUWETZ: So, first, I want to say as a student, I'm very excited to be voting for the first time tomorrow for you.\nSo thank you.\nSANDERS: [inaudible].\nZAKUBUWETZ: My question is, many of your supporters are staunchly opposed to Hillary Clinton and are considering writing you in, voting for a third party candidate or not voting at all if you don't win the nomination.\nI believe you will win the nomination and the presidency, but if you don't, will you encourage your supporters to vote for Secretary Clinton?\nSANDERS: Well, David, thanks for the question.\nAnd let me answer it, uh, in this way. Um, first, um, I think it is, you know, we are not a movement where I can snap my fingers and say to you or to anybody else what you should do, because you won't listen to me. You shouldn't. Uh, you'll make these decisions yourself.\nI think if we end up losing -- and I hope we do not -- and if Secretary Clinton wins, it is incumbent upon her to tell millions of people who right now do not believe in establishment politics or establishment economics, who have serious misgivings about a candidate who has received millions of dollars from Wall Street and other special interests.\nShe has got to go out to you and to millions of other people and say, yes, I think the United States should join the rest of the industrialized world and take on the private insurance companies and the greed of the drug companies and pass a Medicare for all.\nI think that says Secretary Clinton, that for the young people in this country, you should not have to leave college $30,000, $50,000, $70,000 in debt because we're going to make as many other countries around the world do, public colleges and universities tuition-free. I think Secretary Clinton is going to have to explain to millions of young people and a lot of other people that climate change is a real crisis and incrementalism is just not going to solve it. That's... [applause]...[inaudible]...[applause]\nAnd she is going to have to come on board and say, yes, I know it's hard, but I am going to take on the fossil fuel industry and pass a carbon tax.\nSo the -- the point that I am making is, it is incumbent upon Secretary Clinton to reach out not only to my supporters, but to all of the American people, with an agenda that they believe will represent the interests of working families, lower income people, the middle class, those of us who are concerned about the environment and not just big money interests.\nHAYES: There is -- there are Hillary Clinton supporters who I talk to, um, people who -- some of whom are -- are die hard [inaudible] they voted for her, they like you, they like your politics. But it -- but there is concern that thing you said at the beginning of that answer strikes me as important. You can't snap your fingers. I mean people -- this thing is big and people are very passionate.\nUm, you know, you have Tim Robbins' gun event for you. He Tweeted something today about the elections being stolen. And Rosario Dawson mentioned Monica Lewinsky and all of that is going to come out in the wash, I agree.\nBut the question for you is, if it's incumbent on her, what role do you have if and when you come to that moment? [applause]\nSANDERS: Good. [applause]\nFair question. [applause]\nI work with Republicans in the U.S. Senate and I see what they do in the House. I think the Republican Party today has moved so far to the right that they are way, way, way out of touch with where the American people are.\nThese are people who almost without exception do not even recognize the reality of climate change, let alone want to anything about it.\nThey want to cut Social Security and give tax breaks to billionaires. They want to end the Affordable Care Act, but they have nothing to replace it with.\nI will do everything in my power to make sure that no Republican gets into the White House in this election cycle. [applause]\nHAYES: Um, all right, we are going to take a quick break and we will be back right here at the National Constitution Center with more questions from the [inaudible]...[applause]\n[commercial break]\n[applause]\nHAYES: We are back here in the National Constitution Center with Bernie Sanders in a town hall.\nWe have a question now from Becky Cerna, who is at U Penn studying nursing and is undecided.\nBecky?\nBECKY CERNA: Hi. My name is Becky and my parents are undocumented immigrants who arrived from Mexico so that I could have opportunities that they could only dream of. This has come with a life full of personal sacrifices and economic hardship.\nYou propose to implement immigration reform that will create a path to full and equal citizenship.\nHow will you ensure that after implementation, immigrants like my grand -- like my parents, aren't treated as second class citizens?\nSANDERS: Um, Becky, thank you for the question.\nUh, we have 11 million undocumented people in this country today. Many of them are being exploited because when you don't have any legal rights, your employer can take advantage of you.\nMany of them are living in fear and living in the shadows.\nSo I believe absolutely that we have to move aggressively toward comprehensive immigration reform.\nMy dad was an immigrant. He came to this country at the age of 17. I know a little bit about the immigrant experience.\nComprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.\nNow, my concern is that if Congress does not do what it should do and pass that legislation, I will pick up where President Obama left office and use the executive powers of the presidency to do everything that I can to make your parents safe in this country and not afraid.\nAnd the other thing that I will do, where I do disagree with President Obama, I will end the deportations. [inaudible]. [applause]\nHAYES: All right, um, we now have Natalie Herbert.\nShe is getting a PhD from the Annenberg School of Communications at U Penn and supports Hillary Clinton.\nNATALIE HERBERT: Thank you, Senator Sanders.\nSANDERS: Thank you.\nHERBERT: So much of your campaign rhetoric is about revolutionary politics. But so much of a president's job is inherently tied to institutions and bureaucracies as they exist.\nSo, how do you keep the revolutionary spirit alive despite these constraints?\nSANDERS: OK. Thank you.\nUm, you're right in saying that a lot of the day to day work is going to take place in Capitol Hill and it's messy and there's a lot of negotiating. What I will tell you is that when I was in the House, in a given number of years, I ended up passing more amendments on the floor of the House working with Republicans than any other member of the House. I can work with Republicans.\nJust a few years ago, I helped pass, as chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, the most comprehensive veterans legislation in modern history... [applause] ...working with John McCain and a number of other Republicans.\nSo if the question is, can I sit down, you know, with conservative people like Chris here and negotiate with them... [laughter] ...yes, I can do that.\nBut let me also say this, and this is important. At the end of the day, the powers that be, the powers who control -- people who control the Congress, the big money interests and Wall Street, they are not going to allow the kind of real change that this country needs, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, ending our disastrous trade policies so that corporate America starts investing in this country rather than China, making sure that women do not continue to earn 79 cents on the dollar compared to men, aggressively addressing climate change, making sure that public colleges and universities are tuition-free.\nThat is not going to be done by Congress itself. That requires a political revolution. And as president of the United States, what I would do is use the bully pulpit in an unprecedented way to rally the American people to demand that the Congress listens to their needs, not just the needs of wealthy campaign contributors. [applause]\nHAYES: President Obama... [applause] ...President Obama, when he came into office, had this new, unprecedented thing called Obama for America, right, where they...\nSANDERS: Yes.\nHAYES: -- they basically preserved the campaign organization...\nSANDERS: Right.\nHAYES: -- and...\nSANDERS: Right.\nHAYES: -- full disclosure, my brother worked for them. He was an organizer. Um, and that proved tough, in a lot of ways, for it to work. Um, part of that, I think, had to do with the inherent tension between being the president of the United States and outside power.\nWhat have you learned from that?\nWhat is the model, if that -- if that seemed to not do what you're talking about...\nSANDERS: Actually, I talked to the president about that. And from what he, you know, indicated, it's tough. And it is tough. It is really tough.\nUh, but I think that one of the most important things that a president can do is to help ordinary people come together in a variety of grassroots organizations to put the pressure on the Congress to counterbalance the pressure that Wall Street and wealthy campaign contributors now exert.\nFor example, let me just give you one example and on this one, I am 100 percent sure that I'm right.\nIf the young people of this country stood up and were very loud and clear that they are sick and tired of leaving college $30,000, $50,000, $70,000 in debt, that they want public colleges and universities tuition-free, and if millions of them stood up, started emailing, writing and demonstrating, without the slightest doubt, that is exactly what would happen. [applause]\nSo the question is, this is what the American people want.\nThe question is, how we put together...\nHAYES: Right.\nSANDERS: -- that type of grassroots organization...\nHAYES: But that's a hard thing to do.\nSANDERS: It is a hard thing to do. But for the future of this country, that is exactly what has to be done.\nLet me say this about the president...\nHAYES: Yes.\nSANDERS: -- somebody I love and have enormous respect for. I think because he is such a decent guy, in many respects, he actually believed that he could walk into the Oval Office and sit down with Republicans and negotiate in good faith. He was wrong about that. Republicans had no intention of ever negotiating in good faith. What they wanted to do was obstruct, obstruct, obstruct in an unprecedented way.\nAnd it took the president a number of years to learn that lesson. He knows it now and that's why his pen and executive orders are flying out. I have learned that lesson. I will know that when I get into the Oval Office.\nHAYES: Do you predict that would -- whoever the Democratic president, should there be a Democratic president elected in January of next year, do you believe they will be met with functionally that same attitude?\nSANDERS: Yes. I think the Republican Party, as I mentioned a moment ago, has moved very, very far to the right. Obviously they are beholden to the wealthy corporate interests, but they are now also beholden to an extreme right wing base, you know, people who are active in the horrific, you know, Trump ethic, on the birther movement, people who are very hostile to immigrants.\nYou see Trump talking about and referring to Mexicans as racists and criminals, wanting to ban Muslims from coming into this country. And those concepts do have a certain support.\nSo do I think if I became president that we'd run into that type of obstructionism? Yes, I do.\nHAYES: Terry Smith, legal aid lawyer, undecided until the issue that she is going to, I believe, ask you a question about.\nQUESTION: Senator Sanders, I was surprised and disappointed to hear you oppose Philadelphia's efforts to bring universal preschool to all kids through a tax on big soda distributors. Here in Pennsylvania we have a state legislature that doesn't adequately fund our existing public schools, and importantly, we also have a constitution that prohibits us from taxing just the wealthy.\nSo given those constraints, I'm interested in hearing your ideas for funding winnable anti-poverty agendas like pre-K for all.\nSANDERS: First of all, please do not be disappointed in my views on pre-K. I believe that we have right now in my state and in Pennsylvania a dysfunctional pre-K system, which is a national disgrace. That we have child care workers who make less than McDonald's employees, where we have parents who cannot find quality affordable childcare.\nWe have kids who are entering school way behind because they are not getting the intellectual or emotional nourishment that they need. I believe absolutely, and if elected president one of my priorities would be to establish a cutting-edge high-quality pre-K system in every state in this country. I can't think of many things that are more important to me than that.\nBut when it comes to funding these programs, at a time when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, when 58 percent of all the income goes to the top 1 percent, to ask poor people to pay for that, it's wrong. You are taking money from the people who are hurting the most.\nSo please count me in as somebody who will aggressively lead the effort for universal, high quality childcare, but I believe it has to be funded in a progressive way. The wealthy and large corporations are going to have to pay for it. [applause]\nHAYES: A follow-up on that because I think it's a really tricky issue and there are people of all kinds of politics on either side of the issue. You know, the big soda companies are on the same side of that, right. And they have poured -- I saw them pour millions of dollars in New York City to fight that. And that's their argument, right. I mean, how do you feel when you end up on the same side as them?\nSANDERS: Look, big soda companies will do what they do. And let me also be clear. I am more than aware of the negative role that sugar is playing in terms of obesity and health in the United States. But what we have got to do is to have progressive taxation.\nLook, and I don't want to have to repeat it, the truth is the very, very rich are becoming much richer. Almost everybody else is becoming poor. It is absurd to go to some of the poorest people and raise their taxes. And by the way, this tax, if I recall, is three cents an ounce. Twelve ounce bottle of soda, that's 36 cents, times five sodas week, that's two bucks, 100 bucks a year. If you don't have a lot of money, you know, that's a lot.\nSo I think what we have got to do is to understand that nationally we need progressive taxation. There are corporations, Chris, right now who make billions of dollars a year in profit, stash their money in the Cayman Islands, not paying a nickel in federal taxes. I intend to and that. [applause]\nThere are multimillionaires and hedge fund operators who pay an effective tax rate lower than many of the people here. I intend to end that.\nSo the argument is not whether we have a high quality pre-K system. We must do that. The argument is that we have got to fund it by asking the wealthiest people who are doing phenomenally well to start paying their fair share of taxes.\nHAYES: Going to take a quick break, and we've got some more from the National Constitution Center in just a minute. Don't go anywhere.\n[commercial break]\nHAYES: We are back at the National Constitution Center with Senator Bernie Sanders, candidate for the Democratic nominee for president. And our next question comes from Suleiman Rahman, who is 48 years old and undecided. Mr. Rahman.\nQUESTION: I want to ask a similar question that was posed to Secretary Clinton about there has been a lot of talk around mass incarceration. Can you speak to, as president, how you will address the issue around the collateral consequences of convictions around housing, around employment, around education.\nSANDERS: Thank you for that important question. As a nation we should be profoundly embarrassed that we have more people in jail than any other country on earth. We spend $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people, disproportionately African-American, Latino and Native American.\nFor a thought, what I would propose is when we have unemployment rates of minority kids of 40 or 50 percent, that maybe it makes more sense to invest in jobs and education for those kids rather than jail and incarceration. [applause]\nSecond of all, we need to end over-policing, and we need to de-militarize local police departments so they don't look like occupying forces.\nThirdly, we need to make police departments reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. Number four, we need to make sure that we end private ownership of prisons and detention centers. And very importantly, and Secretary Clinton and I have a big difference of opinion on this, I think we really need to rethink the war on drugs. [applause]\nNow it turns out that in the last 30 years millions of people have received criminal records because of possession of marijuana. And it turns out also, interestingly enough, that the white community and the black community do marijuana at about equal levels. But blacks are four times more likely to be arrested than whites. So this becomes a racial issue and not just a criminal justice issue.\nI would take marijuana out of the Federal Controlled Substance Act.\nHAYES: Senator, some of sort of the knock-on effects of a criminal justice conviction, particularly a felony conviction, that Mr. Rahman just mentioned, are punitive across the board, right. Student aid, living in public housing. Some of that comes from the '94 crime bill.\nThat was a bill that you got on the floor and said there was a lot about this bill I don't like. You also voted for it. Was that a mistake?\nSANDERS: Well, it's one of these things where you have a -- has the bill had absolutely horrendous impact in terms of mass incarceration? Absolutely. Is that an awful thing? Yes it is. It also had in it, when you sit there and vote, the Violence Against Women Act. And I worked very hard as the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, trying to end domestic violence.\nIt also had in it, as you know, the ban on assault weapons. And I have believed from way back when that assault weapons should not be sold or distributed in the United States of America. These are weapons design not for hunting but to kill people.\nSo, you know, I could see if I had voted against the bill, you know, there would be 30-second ads saying, Bernie Sanders didn't vote to ban assault weapons, didn't support women in the fight against domestic violence.\nBut here is the more important point. It has had a disastrous impact and we've got to undo the damage that it caused.\nHAYES: Obviously you can't go back in time, right. But you learn things about votes -- because all votes, frankly, have some stuff on one side or the other. I mean, do you wish you had that vote back? [crosstalk]\nSANDERS: I wish I had a different piece of legislation. I wish that I could vote for the Violence Against Women Act. And I want to see assault weapons banned in the United States, weapons that were used in Sandy Hook and in other areas.\nSo what we need to do, it doesn't -- you know, 1994 was a long time ago. What we need to do now is address this very serious issue. And I have said this. Let me repeat it again, that if elected president, by the end of my first term we will not have more people in jail than any other country.\nNow the other point that you made, and I thought you were going there, is many people who have felonies in this country, believe it or not 2 million people, lose their right to vote and participate in the political process. My state of Vermont is one of the few states that allows felons to vote. I think we should do that nationally. [applause]\nHAYES: It's been interesting to watch the '94 crime bill being debated in this. I think in the case of Secretary Clinton, if you asked her or people said, what's the biggest vote she regrets, I think people would say it's Iraq. I think she would say that. That's a sort of obvious answer to that.\nWhat is your answer to that question? What is the piece of legislation in the 40 years you have done this where you think to yourself, I got that one wrong?\nSPEAKER: [off-mike]\nSANDERS: Well, you know, Chris, it's hard. I've cast many, many thousands of votes, and there was one vote where it was almost unanimous in the House on de-regulating derivatives and so forth. I should've voted the other way. I mean, like four people -- you know, I had help lead the effort against de-regulation. That was a bad vote.\nBut I'll tell you something. As I look back on my voting record, you know, Secretary Clinton -- and I don't mean to be overly partisan here -- supported DOMA in 1996, and that is the Defense of Marriage Act, which I think she has since apologized for. It was a homophobic piece of legislation. Back then it was not easy to vote against that piece of legislation, all right. I voted against that piece of legislation. [applause]\nBack in the early 1990s, when all of corporate America and all Republicans and many Democrats were pushing these disastrous trade agreements, NAFTA and later CAFTA and permanent noble trade relations with China, I didn't vote for any of them. I helped lead the opposition to them.\nSo I'm not saying by any means that after thousands of those I did not cast a bad vote. I did. But I will say that time and time again I took on issues and voted -- cast votes that were unpopular at the time but turned out years later -- whether it's the vote against the war in Iraq, the vote against trade agreements, voting against DOMA, voting against the first Gulf war. Those are votes that I cast. They were not popular votes. Those are the votes that I cast, and I'm proud of casting those votes. [applause]\nHAYES: We'll be back with much more with Senator Sanders and live questions at the National Constitution Center in just a bit. Don't go anywhere.\n[commercial break]\n[applause]\nHAYES: We're back at National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, site of one of tomorrow's five big contests in the primary, and we have a question now from (Miguel Garces), he's 29 years old and he is supporting Senator Sanders.\nQUESTION: Senator Sanders, you said that you think that the U.S. airstrikes are authorized under current law, but does that mean that the U.S. military can lawfully strike ISIS-affiliated groups in any country around the world?\nSANDERS: No, it does not mean that. I hope, by the way, that we will have an authorization passed by the Congress, and I am prepared to support that authorization if it is tight enough so I am satisfied that we do not get into a never-ending perpetual war in the Middle East. That I will do everything I can to avoid. [applause]\nBut the President, no President, has the ability willy-nilly to be dropping bombs or using drones any place he wants.\nHAYES: The current authorization which you cite in what Miguel just quoted which is the authorization to use military force after 9/11. That has led to the kill list. This President -- literally, there is a kill list. There is a list of people that the U.S. government wants to kill, and it goes about doing it. Would you keep the kill list as President of the United States?\nSANDERS: Look. Terrorism is a very serious issue. There are people out there who want to kill Americans, who want to attack this country, and I think we have a lot of right to defend ourselves. I think as Miguel said, though, it has to be done in a constitutional, legal way.\nHAYES: Do you think what's being done now is constitutional and legal?\nSANDERS: In general I do, yes.\nHAYES: One more question -- the announcement today that the U.S. is going to send 250 Special Forces operators on the ground in Syria. Do you agree with that? Do you think that's permissible, given the fact that there has not been an authorization?\nSANDERS: I think the -- look. Here's the bottom line. ISIS has got to be destroyed, and the way that ISIS must be destroyed is not through American troops fighting on the ground. ISIS must be destroyed and King Abdullah of Jordan has made this clear, that the war is for the soul of Islam and it must be won by the Muslim nations themselves.\nI think what the President is talking about is having American troops training Muslim troops, helping to supply the military equipment they need, and I do support that effort. We need a broad coalition of Muslim troops on the ground. We have had some success in the last year or so putting ISIS on the defensive, we've got to continue that effort.\nHAYES: All right, the next question comes from (Monica Hunt).\nQUESTION: Hello. How do you plan on protecting women's reproductive rights in all states?\nSANDERS: You got it. I do. And I'll tell you how. [applause]\nI have a 100 percent, lifetime pro-choice voting record. I believe – [applause]\nNot only do I vigorously oppose Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, I think we should expand funding for Planned Parenthood --- [applause]\nAnd it is no secret that in states all over this country, in a dozen different ways, there are governors and legislatures who are trying to make it impossible for a woman to control her own body.\nI will use the Department of Justice to go after those states in every way that I legally can. I believe that in the United States of America women have that right to control their own body, and I find that, I must say, completely hypocritical for my Republican colleagues who tell us every day how much they hate government, how they want to get government out of our life, but they think that local state and federal government have the right to tell you and every woman in America what she can do with her body.\nThat is hypocrisy. [applause]\nHAYES: There's a very big abortion case before this eight member Court that is a challenge to the Texas law. That Texas law -- many people believe essentially it upheld death-row inmates in all but name. Meaning it wouldn't overturn it [crosstalk] how bid a deal is that court case to you?\nSANDERS: Of course it's a big deal. And by the way, that is why it goes without saying, that if elected President, I will appoint or nominate people to the Supreme Court who number one are prepared to overturn Citizens United, a disaster and a (poor decision) and number two, absolutely protect a woman's right to choose. [applause]\nHAYES: This has obviously been a contentious fight, on the Democratic side, although not, I think, the most contentious. There have been -- I went down in the archives to look at 2008, it got pretty ugly --\nSANDERS: Yeah it did.\nHAYES: -- and you know 1980 on the Republican side got pretty ugly and Kennedy and Carter -- there's a long list. One of the things that happens, sometimes in those contested intramural disputes is someone had the other person serve on their ticket or in their administration. Would you consider that in this case, either having Hillary Clinton on your ticket or being on hers?\nSANDERS: Well let me just answer that question in exactly the way you knew I would answer it. And that is to say right now we are running as hard as we can to win this thing, and at the end of the process we'll take a look at what's going on, but right now my job is to get as many delegates as possible and try to win the nomination for President. [applause]\nBut you knew that that would be my answer.\nHAYES: Well we try.\nI've interviewed you probably dozens of times since you started running for President, and before that. And what's happened in this campaign in some ways is things you've been talking about haven't changed that much between before you were running for President and running for President. But you have found an audience for them that is bigger, I think it's fair to say, than when you were just a United States Senator from Vermont.\nYou have also had to go out and politic in places where you didn't have to politic before. You're from Vermont. You've been in Baltimore, you've been in Philadelphia, been in Chicago. You are trying to run the Obama coalition, right? You are trying to -- you're running in the party of the first black president. What have you learned on this campaign about race in America, about the way this coalition operates? What have you learned -- what have you come away thinking, \"I did not know before I ran for President, this, and now I know?\"\nSANDERS: How many hours do we have to discuss that? I mean, one of the extraordinary things about the experience of running for President is you learn just so, so much, and you meet so many extraordinary people.\nWe have been -- I have been, obviously, to Flint, Michigan -- and let me tell you something Chris. I will never forget that experience as long as I live talking to a mother who described to me the breakdown of the cognitive capabilities of her daughter because that daughter was drinking poisoned water.\nAnd you ask yourself how that could possibly happen in the United States of America. You've heard me being critical of media more times than one, but I think people in America really don't know, not only what's going on in Flint, Michigan, they don't know that the Detroit public school system is on the verge of a fiscal collapse. They don't know that in Baltimore, Maryland there are tens of thousands of heroin addicts. They don't know that in inner cities all over this country people are paying 40, 50, 60 percent of their limited incomes for housing, that there is not enough affordable housing. People do not really know what is going on in African-American communities where kids are suffering 40, 50, 60 percent rates of unemployment and what I have learned in this campaign, is if I get elected President we are gonna change national priorities.\nWe're not just gonna rebuild communities in Iraq and Afghanistan, we're going to rebuild them in the United States of America. [applause]\nHAYES: Senator Sanders, thank you very much. Everyone here at National Constitution Center, we thank you very much, (regret to leave) all these wonderful folks.\nUp next don't go anywhere, Rachel Maddow hosts another super town hall event with Hillary Clinton.

Please have a seat. Guten morgen! Once again, I want to thank Chancellor Merkel and everyone here at Hannover Messe for welcoming us. Angela and I already spoke last night. I'm giving a speech later this morning. So I'm going to be very brief.\nAs I said last night, so much of our global economy and the growth that creates jobs is driven by the spirit of innovation—discovery, invention—and then turning those ideas into new products, companies, new industries, new services that create good jobs. So here at the U.S. pavilion, we are proud to showcase America's commitment to innovation. You'll see pioneering companies that are changing the way that we live, the way that we work, the way that we learn. So this is another chance for me to tell everyone to come here and buy \"Made in America.\"\nLast night, I also talked about why companies around the world that are looking for where to set up shop should select America. And here at the pavilion, you'll find States, cities, and communities from across the United States who are ready to welcome you with open arms.\nOf course, Angela may have different ideas when we go to the German pavilion. [Laughter] But this friendly competition is healthy. It is what has made our two countries some of the most competitive in the world, our workers the best in the world, our products the best in the world.\nSo again, I want to thank Angela and everyone at Hannover Messe. I expect that the results—as a result of this great event, we'll see more partnerships, more trade, and more good jobs for our people on both sides of the Atlantic. Angela and I are going to go check out some exhibits, but first I know that she wants to say a few words as well.\n[At this point, Chancellor Merkel spoke in German, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nChancellor Merkel. Mr. President, dear Barack, I am delighted that we are able to welcome so many guests from the United States here today. You have more than 400 exhibitors, more than 400 companies that are presenting their goods, that are presenting their products here this year as guest country, as partner country of the Hannover Fair. And I'm very much looking forward that later on we're going to take a tour and we're going to be presented very tangible examples of what companies produce here and what the companies themselves are doing.\nWell, I think I can safely speak on behalf of the German business community as well when I welcome you most cordially—you, the representatives of your companies here—as friends. We know you are our friends, you are partners. But you're also very strong companies, and we know that you want to present your products here. You want to be strong. But our companies, too, want to present their products, want to be strong, they want to learn from you. We want to learn from each other. We want to get closer to each other, because we both want to shape innovation. We want to be forward looking in this world of tomorrow.\nAnd I think we're—all of us are very interested in bringing our products to bear in this world that is getting more and more interesting—to present our products here at the Hannover Fair. And we're—hope and trust that this Hannover Fair again will be a highlight of industrial production and of trade. It is a top-of-the-world event as regards industrial trade fairs, and we trust that it's going to be the same this year again.\nBut I think we should not forget that, obviously, companies are presenting themselves here during this industrial trade fair, but behind companies are always and invariably the members of the workforce. Workers, ordinary Americans, want to secure their jobs—and ordinary Germans, for that matter—who want safe jobs, who want to secure their jobs, who want to work for their prospects. And so that's never an abstract concept. But it's also so that such an industrial fair also is about people, about people on both sides of the Atlantic. So what we have here today is also a piece of America that we see and that we meet.\nAnd again, a very warm welcome to all of you.\n[Chancellor Merkel spoke in English as follows.]\nChancellor Merkel. And now I learn the proof of the pudding is the eating. Let's start.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 11:22 a.m. in Building 35 at the Hannover Messe Fairgrounds. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Stephan Weil of Lower Saxony, Germany; President François Hollande of France; Prime Minister David W.D. Cameron of the United Kingdom; Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy; and Windsor, Canada, resident Ahmad Abu Nokta, a Syrian artist who fled the southwestern city of Daraa with his wife and four children in 2013.

It is wonderful to see all of you, and I want to begin by thanking Chancellor Merkel for being here. On behalf of the American people, I want to thank Angela for being a champion of our alliance. And on behalf of all of us, I want to thank you for your commitment to freedom and equality and human rights, which is a reflection of your inspiring life. I truly believe you've shown us the leadership of steady hands. How do you call it? The Merkel-Raute. [Laughter] And over the last 7 years, I have relied on your friendship and counsel, and your firm moral compass. So we very much appreciate your Chancellor, Angela Merkel.\nTo the Members of the Bundestag, Prime Minister Weil, Mayor Schostok, distinguished guests, people of Germany. And I'm especially pleased to see the young people here, from Germany and across Europe. We also have some proud Americans here. [Laughter]\nI have to admit that I have developed a special place in my heart for the German people. Back when I was a candidate for this office, you welcomed me with a small rally in Berlin—[laughter]—where I spoke of the change that's possible when the world stands as one. As President, you've treated me and Michelle and our daughters to wonderful hospitality. You've offered me excellent beer—[laughter]—and weisswurst in Krün. You've now hosted our delegation here in Hannover.\nMy only regret is that I have never been to Germany for Oktoberfest. [Laughter] So I will have to come back. And I suspect it's more fun when you're not President. [Laughter] So my timing will be good.\nAnd as always, I bring the friendship of the American people. We consider the German people, and all of our European allies, to be among our closest friends in the world, because we share so much experience and so many of the same values. We believe that nations and peoples should live in security and peace. We believe in creating opportunity that lifts up not just the few but the many. And I'm proud to be the first American President to come to Europe and be able to say that in the United States, health care is not a privilege, it is now a right for all. We share that as well.\nPerhaps most importantly, we believe in the equality and inherent dignity of every human being. Today in America, people have the freedom to marry the person that they love. We believe in justice, that no child in the world should ever die from a mosquito bite; that no one should suffer from the ache of an empty stomach; that, together, we can save our planet and the world's most vulnerable people from the worst effects of climate change. These are things that we share. It's born of common experience.\nAnd this is what I want to talk to you about today: the future that we are building together—not separately, but together. And that starts right here in Europe.\nAnd I want to begin with an observation that, given the challenges that we face in the world and the headlines we see every day, may seem improbable, but it's true. We are fortunate to be living in the most peaceful, most prosperous, most progressive era in human history. That may surprise young people who are watching TV or looking at your phones and it seems like only bad news comes through every day. But consider that it's been decades since the last war between major powers. More people live in democracies. We're wealthier and healthier and better educated, with a global economy that has lifted up more than a billion people from extreme poverty and created new middle classes from the Americas to Africa to Asia. Think about the health of the average person in the world, tens of millions of lives that we now save from disease and infant mortality, and people now living longer lives.\nAround the world, we're more tolerant, with more opportunity for women and gays and lesbians, as we push back on bigotry and prejudice. And around the world, there's a new generation of young people—like you—that are connected by technology and driven by your idealism and your imagination, and you're working together to start new ventures and to hold governments more accountable and advance human dignity.\nIf you had to choose a moment in time to be born, any time in human history, and you didn't know ahead of time what nationality you were or what gender or what your economic status might be, you'd choose today—which isn't to say that there is not still enormous suffering and enormous tragedy and so much work for us to do. It is to remember that the trajectory of our history over the last 50, 100 years has been remarkable. And we can't take that for granted, and we should take confidence in our ability to be able to shape our own destiny.\nNow, that doesn't mean that we can be complacent, because today dangerous forces do threaten to pull the world backward, and our progress is not inevitable. These challenges threaten Europe, and they threaten our transatlantic community. We're not immune from the forces of change around the world. As they have elsewhere, barbaric terrorists have slaughtered innocent people in Paris and Brussels and Istanbul and San Bernardino, California. And we see these tragedies in places central to our daily lives—an airport or cafe, a workplace or a theater—and it unsettles us. It makes us unsure in our day-to-day lives, fearful not just for ourselves, but those that we love. Conflicts from South Sudan to Syria to Afghanistan have sent millions fleeing, seeking the relative safety of Europe's shores, but that puts new strains on countries and local communities and threatens to distort our politics.\nRussian aggression has flagrantly violated the sovereignty and territory of an independent European nation, Ukraine, and that unnerves our allies in Eastern Europe, threatening our vision of a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace. And it seems to threaten the progress that's been made since the end of the cold war.\nSlow economic growth in Europe, especially in the south, has left millions unemployed, including a generation of young people without jobs and who may look to the future with diminishing hopes. And all these persistent challenges have led some to question whether European integration can long endure; whether you might be better off separating off, redrawing some of the barriers and the laws between nations that existed in the 20th century.\nAcross our countries, including in the United States, a lot of workers and families are still struggling to recover from the worst economic crisis in generations. And that trauma of millions who lost their jobs and their homes and their savings is still felt. And meanwhile, there are profound trends underway that have been going on for decades—globalization, automation—that in some cases have depressed wages and made workers in a weaker position to bargain for better working conditions. Wages have stagnated in many advanced countries while other costs have gone up. Inequality has increased. And for many people, it's harder than ever just to hold on.\nThis is happening in Europe; we see some of these trends in the United States and across the advanced economies. And these concerns and anxieties are real. They are legitimate. They cannot be ignored, and they deserve solutions from those in power. Unfortunately, in the vacuum, if we do not solve these problems, you start seeing those who would try to exploit these fears and frustrations and channel them in a destructive way. A creeping emergence of the kind of politics that the European project was founded to reject: an \"us\" versus \"them\" mentality that tries to blame our problems on the other, somebody who doesn't look like us or doesn't pray like us, whether it's immigrants or Muslims or somebody who is deemed different than us.\nAnd you see increasing intolerance in our politics. And loud voices get the most attention. This reminds you of the poem by the great Irish poet W.B. Yeats, where \"the best lack all conviction,\" and \"the worst are full of passionate intensity.\"\nSo this is a defining moment. And what happens on this continent has consequences for people around the globe. If a unified, peaceful, liberal, pluralistic, free-market Europe begins to doubt itself, begins to question the progress that's been made over the last several decades, then we can't expect the progress that is just now taking hold in many places around the world will continue. Instead, we will be empowering those who argue that democracy can't work, that intolerance and tribalism and organizing ourselves along ethnic lines and authoritarianism and restrictions on the press—that those are the things that the challenges of today demand.\nSo I've come here today, to the heart of Europe, to say that the United States, and the entire world, needs a strong and prosperous and democratic and united Europe.\nAnd perhaps you need an outsider, somebody who is not European, to remind you of the magnitude of what you have achieved. The progress that I described was made possible in large measure by ideals that originated on this continent in a great Enlightenment and the founding of new republics. Of course, that progress didn't travel a straight line. In the last century—twice in just 30 years—the forces of empire and intolerance and extreme nationalism consumed this continent. And cities like this one were largely reduced to rubble. Tens of millions of men and women and children were killed.\nBut from the ruins of the Second World War, our nations set out to remake the world, to build a new international order and the institutions to uphold it: a United Nations to prevent another world war and advance a more just and lasting peace, international financial institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to promote prosperity for all peoples, a Universal Declaration of Human Rights to advance the \"inalienable rights of all members of the human family.\" And here in Europe, giants like Chancellor Adenauer set out to bind old adversaries through commerce and through trade. As Adenauer said in those early days: \"European unity was a dream of a few. It became a hope for [the] many. Today it is a necessity for all of us.\"\nAnd it wasn't easy. Old animosities had to be overcome. National pride had to be joined with a commitment to a common good. Complex questions of sovereignty and burden sharing had to be answered. And at every step, the impulse to pull back, for each country to go its own way, had to be resisted. More than once, skeptics predicted the demise of this great project.\nBut the vision of European unity soldiered on, and having defended Europe's freedom in war, America stood with you every step of this journey: a Marshall Plan to rebuild, an airlift to save Berlin, a NATO alliance to defend our way of life. America's commitment to Europe was captured by a young American President, John F. Kennedy, when he stood in a free West Berlin and declared that \"freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free.\" With strength and resolve and the power of our ideals and a belief in a unified Europe, we didn't simply end the cold war. Freedom won. Germany was reunited. You welcomed new democracies into an even—\"ever closer union.\" You may argue over whose football clubs are better, vote for different singers on Eurovision. [Laughter] But your accomplishment—more than 500 million people speaking 24 languages in 28 countries, 19 with a common currency, in one European Union—remains one of the greatest political and economic achievements of modern times.\nYes, European unity can require frustrating compromise. It adds layers of government that can slow decisionmaking. I understand. I've been in meetings with the European Commission. And, as an American, we're famously disdainful of government. We understand how easy it must be to vent at Brussels and complain. But remember that every member of your Union is a democracy. That's not an accident. Remember that no EU country has raised arms against another. That's not an accident. Remember that NATO is as strong as it's ever been.\nRemember that our market economies, as Angela and I saw this morning, are the greatest generators of innovation and wealth and opportunity in history. Our freedom, our quality of life remains the envy of the world, so much so that parents are willing to walk across deserts, cross the seas on makeshift rafts and risk everything in the hope of giving their children the blessings that we—that you—enjoy, blessings that you cannot take for granted.\nThis continent, in the 20th century, was at constant war. People starved on this continent. Families were separated on this continent. And now people desperately want to come here precisely because of what you've created. You can't take that for granted.\nAnd today, more than ever, a strong, united Europe remains, as Adenauer said, a necessity for all of us. It's a necessity for the United States, because Europe's security and prosperity is inherently indivisible from our own. We can't cut ourselves off from you. Our economies are integrated. Our cultures are integrated. Our peoples are integrated. You saw the response of the American people to Paris and Brussels; it's because, in our imaginations, this is our cities.\nA strong, united Europe is a necessity for the world because an integrated Europe remains vital to our international order. Europe helps to uphold the norms and rules that can maintain peace and promote prosperity around the world.\nConsider what we've done in recent years: pulling the global economy back from the brink of depression and putting the world on the path of recovery; a comprehensive deal that's cut off every single one of Iran's paths to a nuclear bomb, part of a shared vision of a world without nuclear weapons; in Paris, the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change; stopping Ebola in West Africa and saving countless lives; rallying the world around new sustainable development, including our goal to end extreme poverty. None of those things could have happened if I—if the United States—did not have a partnership with a strong and united Europe. It wouldn't have happened.\nThat's what's possible when Europe and America and the world stand as one. And that's precisely what we're going to need to face down the very real dangers that we face today. So let me just lay out the kind of cooperation that we're going to need. We need a strong Europe to bear its share of the burden, working with us on behalf of our collective security. The United States has an extraordinary military, the best the world's ever known, but the nature of today's threats means we can't deal with these challenges by ourselves. Right now the most urgent threat to our nations is ISIL, and that's why we're united in our determination to destroy it. And all 28 NATO allies are contributing to our coalition, whether it's striking ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq or supporting the air campaign or training local forces in Iraq or providing critical humanitarian aid. And we continue to make progress, pushing ISIL back from territory that it controlled.\nAnd just as I've approved additional support for Iraqi forces against ISIL, I've decided to increase U.S. support for local forces fighting ISIL in Syria. A small number of American special operations forces are already on the ground in Syria, and their expertise has been critical as local forces have driven ISIL out of key areas. So given the success, I've approved the deployment of up to 250 additional U.S. personnel in Syria, including special forces, to keep up this momentum. They're not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces that continue to drive ISIL back.\nSo make no mistake. These terrorists will learn the same lesson as others before them have, which is, your hatred is no match for our nations united in the defense of our way of life. And just as we remain relentless on the military front, we're not going to give up on diplomacy to end the civil war in Syria, because the suffering of the Syrian people has to end, and that requires an effective political transition.\nBut this remains a difficult fight, and none of us can solve this problem by ourselves. Even as European countries make important contributions against ISIL, Europe, including NATO, can still do more. So I've spoken to Chancellor Merkel, and I'll be meeting later with the Presidents of France and the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and of Italy. In Syria and Iraq, we need more nations contributing to the air campaign. We need more nations contributing trainers to help build up local forces in Iraq. We need more nations to contribute economic assistance to Iraq so it can stabilize liberated areas and break the cycle of violent extremism so that ISIL cannot come back.\nThese terrorists are doing everything in their power to strike our cities and kill our citizens, so we need to do everything in our power to stop them. And that includes closing gaps so terrorists can't pull off attacks like those in Paris and Brussels.\nWhich brings me to one other point. Europeans, like Americans, cherish your privacy. And many are skeptical about governments collecting and sharing information, for good reason. That skepticism is healthy. Germans remember their history of government surveillance; so do Americans, by the way, particularly those who were fighting on behalf of civil rights. So it's part of our democracies to want to make sure our governments are accountable.\nBut I want to say this to young people who value their privacy and spend a lot of time on their phones: The threat of terrorism is real. In the United States, I've worked to reform our surveillance programs to ensure that they're consistent with the rule of law and upholding our values, like privacy. And by the way, we include the privacy of people outside of the United States. We care about Europeans' privacy, not just Americans' privacy.\nBut I also, in working on these issues, have come to recognize security and privacy don't have to be a contradiction. We can protect both. And we have to. If we truly value our liberty, then we have to take the steps that are necessary to share information and intelligence within Europe, as well as between the United States and Europe, to stop terrorists from traveling and crossing borders and killing innocent people.\nAnd as today's diffuse threats evolve, our alliance has to evolve. So we're going to have a NATO summit this summer in Warsaw, and I will insist that all of us need to meet our responsibilities, united, together. That means standing with the people of Afghanistan as they build their security forces and push back against violent extremism. It means more ships in the Aegean to shut down criminal networks who are profiting by smuggling desperate families and children.\nAnd that said, NATO's central mission is and always will be our solemn duty: our article 5 commitment to our common defense. That's why we'll continue to bolster the defense of our frontline allies in Poland and Romania and the Baltic States.\nSo we have to both make sure that NATO carries out its traditional mission, but also to meet the threats of NATO's southern flank. We have to defend the security of every ally. That's why we need to stay nimble and make sure our forces are interoperable and invest in new capabilities like cyberdefense and missile defense. And that's why every NATO member should be contributing its full share—2 percent of GDP—towards our common security, something that doesn't always happen. And I'll be honest, sometimes, Europe has been complacent about its own defense.\nNow, just as we stand firm in our own defense, we have to uphold our most basic principles of our international order, and that's a principle that nations like Ukraine have the right to choose their own destiny. Remember that it was Ukrainians on the Maidan, many of them your age, reaching out for a future with Europe that prompted Russia to send in its military. After all that Europe endured in the 20th century, we must not allow borders to be redrawn by brute force in the 21st century. So we should keep helping Ukraine with its reforms to improve its economy and consolidate its democracy and modernize its forces to protect its independence.\nAnd I want good relations with Russia and have invested a lot in good relations with Russia. But we need to keep sanctions on Russia in place until Russia fully implements the Minsk agreements that Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande and others have worked so hard to maintain and provide a path for a political resolution of this issue. And ultimately, it is my fervent hope that Russia recognizes that true greatness comes not from bullying neighbors, but by working with the world, which is the only way to deliver lasting economic growth and progress to the Russian people.\nNow, our collective security rests on a foundation of prosperity, so that brings me to my next point. The world needs a prosperous and growing Europe, not just a strong Europe, but a prosperous and growing Europe that generates good jobs and wages for its people.\nAs I mentioned before, the economic anxieties many feel today on both sides of the Atlantic are real. The disruptive changes brought about by the global economy, unfortunately, sometimes are hitting certain groups, especially working class communities, more heavily. And if neither the burdens, nor the benefits of our global economy are being fairy distributed, it's no wonder that people rise up and reject globalization. If there are too few winners and too many losers as the global economy integrates, people are going to push back.\nSo all of us in positions of power have a responsibility—as leaders of government and business and civil society—to help people realize the promise of economic and security in this integrated economy. And the good news is, we know how to do it. Sometimes, we just lack the political will to do it.\nIn the United States, our economy is growing again, but the United States can't be the sole engine of global growth. And countries should not have to choose between responding to crises and investing in their people. So we need to pursue reforms to position us for long-term prosperity and support demand and invest in the future. All of our countries, for example, could be investing more in infrastructure. All of our countries need to invest in science and research and development that sparks new innovation and new industries. All of our countries have to invest in our young people and make sure that they have the skills and the training and the education they need to adapt to this rapidly changing world. All of our countries need to worry about inequality and make sure that workers are getting a fair share of the incredible productivity that technology and global supply chains are producing.\nBut if you're really concerned about inequality, if you're really concerned about the plight of workers, if you're a progressive, it's my firm belief that you can't turn inward. That's not the right answer. We have to keep increasing the trade and investment that supports jobs, as we're working to do between the United States and the EU. We need to keep implementing reforms to our banking and financial systems so that the excesses and abuses that triggered the financial crisis never happen again.\nBut we can't do that individually, nation by nation, because finance now is transnational. It moves around too fast. If we're not coordinating between Europe and the United States and Asia, then it won't work.\nAs the world's been reminded in recent weeks, we need to close loopholes that allow corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share of taxes through tax havens and tax avoidance, trillions of dollars that could be going towards pressing needs like education and health care and infrastructure. But to do that, we have to work together.\nHere in Europe, as you work to strengthen your Union—including through labor and banking reforms and by ensuring growth across the euro zone—you will have the staunch support of the United States. But you're going to have to do it together, because your economies are too integrated to try to solve these problems on your own. And I want to repeat: We have to confront the injustice of widening economic inequality. But that is going to require collective work, because capital is mobile, and if only a few countries are worrying about it, then a lot of businesses will head towards places that don't care about it quite as much.\nFor a lot of years, it was thought that countries had to choose between economic growth and economic inclusion. Now we know the truth: When wealth is increasingly concentrated among the few at the top, it's not only a moral challenge to us, but it actually drags down a country's growth potential. We need growth that is broad and lifts everybody up. We need tax policies that do right by working families.\nAnd those like me who support European unity and free trade also have a profound responsibility to champion strong protections for workers: a living wage and the right to organize and a strong safety net and a commitment to protect consumers and the environment upon which we all depend. If we really want to reduce inequality, we've got to make sure everyone who works hard gets a fair shot—and that's especially true for young people like you—with education and job training and quality health care and good wages. And that includes, by the way, making sure that there's equal pay for equal work for women.\nThe point is, we have to reform many of our economies. But the answer to reform is not to start cutting ourselves off from each other. Rather, it's to work together. And this brings me back to where I began. The world depends upon a democratic Europe that upholds the principles of pluralism and diversity and freedom that are our common creed. As free peoples, we cannot allow the forces that I've described—fears about security or economic anxieties—to undermine our commitment to the universal values that are the source of our strength. Democracy, I understand, can be messy. It can be slow. It can be frustrating. I know that. I have to deal with a Congress. [Laughter] We have to constantly work to make sure government is not a collection of distant, detached institutions, but is connected and responsive to the everyday concerns of our people. There's no doubt that how a united Europe works together can be improved. But look around the world at authoritarian governments and theocracies that rule by fear and oppression. And there is no doubt that democracy is still the most just and effective form of government ever created.\nAnd when I talk about democracy, I don't just mean elections. Because there are a number of countries where people get 70, 80 percent of the vote, but they control all the media and the judiciary, and civil society organizations and NGOs can't organize and have to be registered and are intimidated. I mean real democracy, the sort that we see here in Europe and in the United States. So we have to be vigilant in defense of these pillars of democracy: not just elections, but rule of law, as well as fair elections, a free press, vibrant civil societies where citizens can work for change.\nAnd we should be suspicious of those who claim to have the interests of Europe at heart and yet don't practice the very values that are essential to Europe, that have made freedom in Europe so real.\nSo yes, these are unsettling times. And when the future is uncertain, there seems to be an instinct in our human nature to withdraw to the perceived comfort and security of our own tribe, our own sect, our own nationality, people who look like us, sound like us. But in today's world, more than any time in human history, that is a false comfort. It pits people against one another because of what they look or how they pray or who they love. And yet we know where that kind of twisted thinking can lead. It can lead to oppression. It can lead to segregation and internment camps and to the Shoah and Srebrenica.\nIn the United States, we've long wrestled with questions of race and integration, and we do to this day. And we still have a lot of work to do. But our progress allows somebody like me to now stand here as President of the United States. That's because we committed ourselves to a larger ideal, one based on a creed—and not a race, not a nationality—a set of principles, truths that we held to be self-evident: that all men were created equal. And now, as Europe confronts questions of immigration and religion and assimilation, I want you to remember that our countries are stronger, they are more secure and more successful when we welcome and integrate people of all backgrounds and faith and make them feel as one. And that includes our fellow citizens who are Muslim.\nLook, the sudden arrival of so many people from beyond our borders, especially when their cultures are very different, that can be daunting. We have immigration issues in the United States as well, along our southern border of the United States and from people arriving from all around the world who get a visa and decide they want to stay. And I know the politics of immigration and refugees is hard. It's hard everywhere, in every country. And just as a handful of neighborhoods shouldn't bear all the burden of refugee resettlement, neither should any one nation. All of us have to step up, all of us have to share this responsibility. That includes the United States.\nBut even as we take steps that are required to ensure our security; even as we help Turkey and Greece cope with this influx in a way that is safe and humane; even as Chancellor Merkel and other European leaders work for an orderly immigration and resettlement process, rather than a disorderly one; even as we all need to collectively do more to invest in the sustainable development and governance in those nations from which people are fleeing so that they can succeed and prosper in their own countries and so that we can reduce the conflicts that cause so much of the refugee crisis around the world—Chancellor Merkel and others have eloquently reminded us that we cannot turn our backs on our fellow human beings who are here now and need our help now. We have to uphold our values not just when it's easy, but when it's hard.\nIn Germany, more than anywhere else, we learned that what the world needs is not more walls. We can't define ourselves by the barriers we build to keep people out or to keep people in. At every crossroads in our history, we've moved forward when we acted on those timeless ideals that tells us to be open to one another and to respect the dignity of every human being.\nAnd I think of so many Germans and people across Europe who have welcomed migrants into their homes because, as one woman in Berlin said, \"we needed to do something.\" Just that human impulse to help. And I think of the refugee who said, \"I want to teach my kids the value of working.\" That human impulse to see the next generation have hope. All of us can be guided by the empathy and compassion of His Holiness Pope Francis, who said, \"Refugees are not numbers, they are people who have faces, names, stories, and [they] need to be treated as such.\"\nAnd I know it may seem easy for me to say all this, living on the other side of the ocean. And I know that some will call it blind hope when I say that I am confident that the forces that bind Europe together are ultimately much stronger than those trying to pull you apart. But hope is not blind when it is rooted in the memory of all that you've already overcome—your parents, your grandparents.\nSo I say to you, the people of Europe, don't forget who you are. You are the heirs to a struggle for freedom. You're the Germans, the French, the Dutch, the Belgians, the Luxembourgers, the Italians, and yes, the British, who rose above old divisions and put Europe on the path to union.\nYou're the Poles of Solidarity and the Czechs and Slovaks who waged a Velvet Revolution. You're the Latvians and Lithuanians and Estonians who linked hands in a great human chain of freedom. You're the Hungarians and Austrians who cut through borders of barbed wire. And you're the Berliners who, on that November night, finally tore down that wall. You're the people of Madrid and London who faced down bombings and refused to give in to fear.\nAnd you are the Parisians who, later this year, plan to reopen the Bataclan. You're the people of Brussels, in a square of flowers and flags, including one Belgian who offered a message: We need \"more.\" More understanding. More dialogue. More humanity.\nThat's who you are. United, together. You are Europe: \"United in diversity,\" guided by the ideals that have lit the world, and stronger when you stand as one.\nAs you go forward, you can be confident that your greatest ally and friend, the United States of America, stands with you, shoulder to shoulder, now and forever. Because a united Europe, once the dream of a few, remains the hope of the many and a necessity for us all.\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-04-25", "title": "Remarks in Hannover, Germany"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117338", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:18 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. It's nice to see you all. I guess many of you are attending the briefing because your colleagues were over on the trip last week, but obviously it was an opportunity that the President had to do a lot of important work with our allies and partners around the world on a range of issues. So it was a successful trip, and I'm happy to talk about that or anything else that may be on your mind today.\nSo, Josh, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Welcome back, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you.\nQ: South Korea says that North Korea is on the verge of a fifth nuclear test. I was wondering whether the U.S. can confirm that you're seeing those preparations take place, and what kind of a U.S. response there would be to such an action.\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, at this point I don't have a new assessment to share in terms of potential steps that North Korea could potentially take. Over the last several months, we've seen them engage in a series of actions that are in direct contradiction to U.N. Security Council resolutions. We have expressed our strong concern about those provocative actions. We have marshalled the international community to respond accordingly. And earlier this year, there was a response from the United Nations that actually put in place the farthest-reaching sanctions against North Korea that targeted specific elements of their economy, such as it is, that we know are used to fund these illicit activities.\nSo we're going to continue to ramp up the pressure on the North Korean regime. We're going to continue to work closely with the Chinese government that has more influence with the North Korean government than any other country in the world. And we're going to continue to make clear that the path that North Korea must choose to rejoin the international community is one that involves them committing to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and come into compliance with their international obligations.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about a letter that Senators Gillibrand and Grassley sent to the President asking them to -- asking the White House to investigate why Pentagon officials misled Congress about sexual assault cases. Essentially, the information that's come to light shows that the way that the Pentagon characterized the cases undermined efforts to try and perform that process -- it takes the power away from commanders. Is there any follow-up in the White House to that letter? Do you guys plan to heed the senators' call for an investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific response to the letter to share at this point. Obviously this question is the subject of some disagreement between officials at the Department of Defense and members of Congress. I know leading up to the production of this information there were extensive negotiations between members of Congress and the Department of Defense about this data. So this dispute and the way it's being characterized differently by the two parties is not new.\nThe President has made clear that this is a top priority of the Commander-in-Chief. You've heard the President speak on a number of occasions quite powerfully about the need to eradicate sexual assault from the military. The President has talked movingly about how victims in the United States military should understand that the Commander-in-Chief has their back, and the President has made clear to the civilian and military leadership at the Department of Defense that eradicating sexual assault from the military is a top priority.\nThe President had an opportunity to reinforce that priority at the meeting that he convened with combatant commanders from around the world here at the White House earlier this month. The President convened that meeting on April 6th in the Cabinet Room, and this was a conversation that the President had with the Secretary of Defense that all of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the combatant commanders. And this continues to be a top priority. And the President anticipates and expects that the leadership will follow through on reforms and other appropriate steps based on the President making this a priority.\nQ: But, Josh, I mean, misleading members of Congress is a pretty serious charge. Does the White House have any concerns about the veracity of the information that Pentagon officials provided in testimony to members of Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: Based on what I have read in the reports is that members of Congress have expressed concerns about the way that the information was presented. At the same time, I've seen in in those reports that Department of Defense officials have characterized that material as accurate.\nQ: So you're siding with the Pentagon that --\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm observing at this point is that this information has been the subject of long-running controversy between Congress and the Department of Defense. And while this is an important issue, the difference of agreement about the presentation of this information is something that they're going to have to resolve between Congress and the Department of Defense.\nIt's important that this bureaucratic dispute not overshadow the way that the President has made this a top priority when it comes to military policy. And the President has spoken on this publicly on a number of occasions, and even in his private meetings with the top leaders in the military, the President time and time again makes clear that the Commander-in-Chief has made this a priority and expects military leadership to follow through with the necessary steps to eliminate sexual assault from the military.\nQ: And on the campaign trail, Donald Trump said today that Hillary Clinton has only gotten to where she's gotten because she's played the woman card. Any thoughts about that statement from the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Not really. I think Secretary Clinton and her team can certainly speak to her qualifications and her credentials, and I don't need to weigh in.\nTim.\nQ: I wanted to ask about a division between the two governments in Libya. Evidently, today, the government in eastern Libya shipped a cargo of crude oil, much to the chagrin of the government in Tripoli. Does the administration have a reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen those specific reports. I can tell you that the United States was strongly supportive of the U.N. process that led to the creation of the Government of National Accord that does now reside in Tripoli. We've also been pretty candid about the significant challenges that are facing that newly created government.\nLibya is a unique country. It was one that was presided over by an autocratic dictator for four decades. And the Qaddafi regime succeeded in essentially eroding any pillar of civil society or of government inside that country. And so when he was deposed, the country was struggling and continues to struggle with rebuilding those institutions that are critical to governing a large country like Libya.\nAnd part of what the Government of National Accord is facing is building support among the variety of groups that have sprouted up to try to fill that vacuum. Some of them are armed groups. In other cases, there are fledgling attempts to form some substance or some entity that looks like a government. And the international community, including the United States, continues to support the effort of the GNA to unify that country. And that obviously is going to raise significant questions about security and providing security for the country. It also is going to raise important economic questions like how to effectively manage the oil supply in Cuba -- I'm sorry -- in Libya that obviously has significant consequences for that country's economy.\nSo these are just some of the significant challenges that are facing the government. And the United States, the United Nations, and other countries around the world are strongly supportive of the GNA's efforts. We do not anticipate that they're going to succeed in unifying that country and restoring order to the chaos overnight. But over time, and with a commitment to basic principles, they will be successful.\nQ: U.S. Special Forces have stopped another cargo -- before coming from that government. Is that an option here?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of a discussion about that, but, again, I didn't have a debriefing on this today because I hadn't seen the report.\nQ: Turning to refugee issues in Kansas. Governor Brownback told the administration today that Kansas will withdraw from the U.S. relocation program for refugees. Do you have a reaction to that? And what would this mean, practically? That no refugees would end up in Kansas?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen his letter, so we'll have to take a look at the letter and get back to you on that.\nQ: And just one more on Iran. Heavy-water purchase last week. The Department of Energy said at the time that it's not going to be -- the U.S. is not going to be the customer for the heavy-water forever. And Tom Cotton, Senator Cotton has introduced an amendment saying no U.S. dollars would go to another purchase. How confident is the U.S. that another country will step up and make more of these purchases?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm certainly not an expert on the global market for heavy-water. But I can tell you that the United States, through the Department of Energy, did make this properly licensed purchase of about 32 metric tons of heavy-water. There is a market for heavy-water, particularly when it comes to applications related to industry and research here in the United States. And that's how that material will be used by the Department of Energy -- to essentially sell it at market prices to entities that would use it for industrial or research purposes here in the United States.\nI should underscore that there this is no -- that heavy-water is not radioactive. It doesn't pose any sort of public health concern. But it is valuable in terms of its use in these particular technical applications.\nMore generally, I can say that this is consistent with Iran fulfilling their obligations as a part of their Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. This was the international deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Part of the prescribed steps that they had to take was to reduce their nuclear stockpile and that involved reducing their technological nuclear capabilities. So Iran did have to ship a bunch of its heavy-water out of the country, and that's what they've done and now they're selling off the stockpile. And the United States has purchased some of it for resale to entities in the United States that would use it for research purposes or even industrial purposes in some cases.\nAs it relates to Senator Cotton's amendment, I'm not aware of what sort of impact this could potentially have. I guess I would suggest that if he has genuine concerns about this, maybe he can just write another letter to the Supreme Leader and see how far that gets him. (Laughter.)\nOn that note, Jon.\nQ: Thanks. What was the President's reaction to the brutal killing in Bangladesh of the Foreign Service national who worked for USAID? Did he share that with you?\nMR. EARNEST: Jon, I can tell you that this is a murder that the United States government strongly condemns. The individual who was killed was the employee of the U.S. Agency for International Development in Bangladesh. His name was Xulhaz Mannan. Mr. Mannan served the U.S. embassy in Dhaka with distinction, and he worked on behalf of his fellow Bangladeshis as a voice for justice, equality, human rights for all, including for the local LGBT community. And while his death is obviously a significant tragedy, there are also reports that indicate that he was targeted because of his advocacy for these human rights, and that makes his death even more tragic than it seems.\nMr. Mannan set an example of dignity, courage, and selflessness, and his legacy will live on in the causes that he championed. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr. Mannan's loved ones as they mourn his loss. And we strongly encourage the government of Bangladesh to ensure that the perpetrators of this senseless crime are brought to justice. I can tell you that the U.S. government has already been in touch with the government of Bangladesh to make it clear that this investigation is a priority. And we are pleased to see that, so far, the government is moving forward with the kind of thorough criminal investigation that we would expect them to conduct.\nQ: Does the President believe that the government of Bangladesh should take a stronger public stance against these high-profile crimes? It seems like there have been a few, not just this one.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, our expectation is that the government of Bangladesh should engage in a serious criminal investigation to determine who is responsible and to bring those individuals to justice. They've committed a heinous crime and they should be held accountable for it.\nQ: One more question on Judge Garland. I believe it's been 4i days since he was nominated. Is the pressure that the White House is putting on Republicans, is it making any sort of impact on Capitol Hill? What do you see developing over the last several weeks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think in the last week or so we have seen some signs that Republicans continue to feel pressure from the American public as they refuse to do their job. This is a convenient opportunity for me to say that Chief Judge Garland will be participating in a number of other meetings on Capitol Hill over the course of this week. Tomorrow, Wednesday, he has meetings scheduled with Senator Lankford of Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, Senator Rounds of South Dakota, and Senator Nelson of Florida. And on Thursday, he'll meet with Senator Peters of Michigan and Senator Widen of Oregon.\nSo he's going to continue to have meetings with individual senators. This is consistent with the way the process usually works. And the way the process usually works is that after these private meetings are completed that there's an open hearing that is scheduled. And the kinds of issues that are discussed in private by the Chief Judge and individual members of the Senate are then discussed publicly. And that's appropriate.\nAnd there are certainly a number of Republicans -- 11 -- who have already met with -- 11 Republican senators who have already met with Chief Judge Garland and many of them have had nice things to say about the Judge. We heard Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina indicate that Chief Judge Garland's reputation is \"beyond reproach.\" Senator Portman described Chief Judge Garland as \"an impressive guy.\" Senator Toomey described Chief Judge Garland as \"very, very smart, very knowledgeable.\" And Senator Flake noted that Chief Judge Garland is \"obviously a man of accomplishment and keen intellect.\"\nI think the question for all of these senators who have made a strong case that the American public should have a voice in this process -- I think the question is why are they denying the American public the opportunity to hear directly from Chief Judge Garland? Why wouldn't they support a hearing, particularly when they have nice things to say about him? I also understand that Senator Toomey had some criticisms to lodge against Chief Judge Garland's record. I would actually make the case that that is all the more reason to hold a hearing.\nEven across party lines, I think most Americans subscribe to this general notion of fairness, and for Senator Toomey to criticize Chief Judge Garland and his record without giving Chief Judge Garland the opportunity to answer questions about it, that's just unfair. And it's even worse when you consider that it's Senator Toomey's job to ensure that Chief Judge Garland has an opportunity to discuss these issues in public. So it's not just unfair, it is a classic example of Washington obstruction that, frankly, I think the American people are going to be pretty dissatisfied with. And there's plenty of public polling to indicate that that's the case.\nAnd, look, the message has gotten through at least in the state of Florida; you have a Republican candidate for the United States Senate who, I understand, just yesterday said, \"I do think he should have a hearing and I would like to see a vote.\" That's not a Democrat saying that. That is a Republican candidate for the United States Senate. And I think that is a pretty good piece of evidence that somebody who is obviously making a pretty direct appeal to the people of Florida that he should be the representative of their state and that legislative body that his view is consistent with the expectations of most of his -- most of the citizens in his state.\nAnd I think it's notable that we're not talking about a candidate for the United States Senate that's a Democrat. We're not even talking about a candidate for the United States Senate that's a Republican that's running in a blue state. We're talking about a Republican candidate that's running in the biggest swing state in the country, and even he is making the case that Chief Judge Garland deserves a hearing and a vote.\nSo I think that's a pretty good piece of evidence that Republicans continue to feel pressure from the public. And they should. They've taken a position that's stands in stark contrast to the expectations not just of a majority of Democrats and independents, but in plenty of polls there's strong indications that the position that they've taken is not even approved of by a majority of Republicans.\nQ: Just one more, quick question. This is on a different topic. But Senator Durbin and a couple others are on Capitol Hill today calling for a ban on powered caffeine -- just one teaspoon of this can kill somebody -- does the White House support a ban on powered caffeine?\nMR. EARNEST: I am not aware of the policy position that we've taken on this. But let me check with our Domestic Policy Council staff and see if there's a position that we can particularly take.\nLuke.\nQ: Thank you. Recent reports that the White House is considering releasing the 28 pages of the joint inquiry from Congress regarding 9/11 sources of foreign support. Is there any update on that and when those 28 pages could be released?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, to be clear, this would not be released from the White House.\nQ: But if you approved the release from Congress.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's material that is currently being reviewed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, so Director Clapper's office is currently conducting a review to determine how or whether this material could be released without compromising national security. Obviously it's classified right now and they are engaged in a process to determine if we can declassify that information so that it could be released.\nThis is consistent with the process that the Director's office undertakes whenever a piece of information is considered for declassification, and this is obviously something that they've been working on for a long time. I think this has been going through the process for over a year now. And I think that's an indication of just how seriously they're taking this matter.\nI saw that Director Clapper had an opportunity just yesterday to discuss it, and he indicated that he viewed a June time frame as a realistic goal from completing the process of reviewing this information. You will have to check with his office to see whether or not -- what that actually means about the process, but I think it is an indication that Director Clapper is approaching this with the seriousness that is required and that we would all expect.\nQ: Can this be expedited at all because of a bill that while it doesn't directly address that -- the Schumer-Cornyn bill -- which would essentially allow the families of victims of terrorists killed on American soil to sue foreign governments, and Saudi Arabia has been brought up. Is that expedited this at all as sort of a carrot in a way in this ongoing discussion?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can say is this. For the process and for the timeline that's been established, I'd encourage you to check with Director Clapper's office. I can tell you the White House has not made a request of Director Clapper with regard to the process as a result of the legislation being filed.\nQ: And lastly, a recent announcement -- 250 more troops to Syria to combat ISIS. The President saying to \"keep up the momentum.\" Is there a possibility for more troops to be deployed in the near future?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Luke, the President's approach to this situation has been to direct his national security team to consider the range of elements in our strategy. And you'll recall that it was a few months ago that the President initially announced that there would be this commitment of 50 Special Operators to Syria to see if we could deepen our coordination with the forces in Syria that are fighting ISIL. And what the Department of Defense has found is that the efforts of the preliminary commitment of Special Operators proved to be quite useful.\nAnd through deepened coordination and better organization on the ground, we saw improved performance of those forces on the battlefield. And we saw that the United States and our coalition partners were better able to coordinate our efforts with them. And the judgment that was reached by the United States military is that an additional contingent of Special Operators moving into Syria would advance that coordination and that cooperation even further, and that that would yield even more progress on the ground. That's why the President approved the request that the Department of Defense brought forward for that additional contingent of troops.\nSo, to answer your question directly, I think what that means is that if this additional commitment of additional troops yields positive results, and the Department of Defense concludes that, again, additional results could be generated with an additional commitment, then that's something that the President would consider.\nObviously this is something that both the Department of Defense and the Commander-in-Chief would consider quite carefully given the significant risk that these Special Operators are facing. They're not in a combat role, but they are in a role that puts them in harm's way. They are armed for combat. They are armed to defend themselves if necessary. But the role that they have is to offer advice and assistance to forces on the ground fighting ISIL in their own country. And that has proved to be a valuable tool and one that the President is seeking to intensify.\nQ: Considering we don't have a formal AUMF for Syria, are there any geographic limitations on this time of deployment? Libya has ISIS factions. We see some in Africa, as well. Is this something that the American people could expect to see in other parts of the world?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any geographic limitations that have been put in place. Obviously, each country is different, though. Libya is a good example. There are military operations that the Commander-in-Chief has ordered against ISIL targets in Libya. There have been a couple of reports of airstrikes carried out against ISIL targets that have -- back in November took off the battlefield the individual who at the time was described as the most senior ISIL official in the country. There have been other strikes carried out against ISIL targets that included -- or at least one instance in which a military strike was taken against an ISIL target where fighters had congregated in one location.\nSo the President has not hesitated to order military action in Libya, when necessary, to protect the American people and to further advance our campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. There are other places in Africa where the United States is working closely with host governments to help them combat extremism within their own country. I think the most prominent example of this is a concern that we have about Boko Haram. And there are U.S. forces -- U.S. personnel in Nigeria that are working closely with the Nigerian government as they fight those extremist elements in their own country.\nSo we've been clear about what our strategy is, and that strategy is to build up the capacity of local forces in countries around the world to fight extremism. And there are a variety of ways that we do that. In the situation in Iraq, we obviously work closely with the Iraqi central government and support the efforts of Iraqi forces. In Syria, we obviously don't have a situation where we can coordinate with the central government in Syria. We certainly would like to see that, and that's why we believe that a political transition in that country is overdue. But since we can't coordinate directly with the central government in Syria, we're working with those forces on the ground with whom we are able to cooperate, and we are seeing some progress against ISIL targets in Syria.\nSo each of these countries has taken -- is considered individually for the appropriate strategy that will protect the American people -- that is obviously the first priority -- to advance our campaign to degrade and destroy ISIL, but also to build the capacity of fighters to take the fight to ISIL in their own country. And the reason for that is that the United States cannot be a substitute for those kinds of forces. We cannot impose a military solution on ISIL in any country around the world. And, in some cases, it may require military involvement to build the capacity of local fighters to take the fight to ISIL, but the President has made clear that the United States military will not be a substitute for the effectiveness of local fighters.\nMike.\nQ: The Senate Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, said he was blaming the Obama administration for delays in Puerto Rico on a solution, saying that the cause of the delays is questions raised by the Treasury Department. I was wondering what your response was to that. Do you agree with him, or disagree with him? What's your feeling?\nMR. EARNEST: I strongly disagree. And fortunately, the facts are on my side in this one. You may recall, Mike -- I think you've been covering this story closely, so you will recall this -- somewhere there's a Bloomberg story out there, possibly with your byline on it, that dates back to October 21st, 2015. For those of you scoring along at home, that is 188 days ago. And that story included a summarization of our legislative proposal for addressing the situation in Puerto Rico. So we put forward our proposal 188 days ago. It's a little ironic for Leader McCarthy or any other Republican to come forward after 188 days and suggest that somehow the Obama administration has been slow to act to address the situation in Puerto Rico.\nQ: What is your assessment of the risk that there will not be some sort of solution in place by July 1st, when Puerto Rico has to make a $2 billion payment?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I go to great lengths to avoid putting myself in a situation of predicting a positive outcome from Congress, particularly because there are plenty of common-sense things that Congress should do that they don't. In many cases, there are a variety of explanation for that. Sometimes that is just run-of-the-mill congressional dysfunction. Sometimes it is the fact that Republicans allow ideology and partisan politics and political considerations to get in front of core American priorities. In some cases, it's because the issues that they're working through are really complicated and really hard. As it relates to Puerto Rico, it's probably some combination of all three of those things.\nAnd so I can tell you that at least we are encouraged by the fact that the Republican Leader of the House has finally acknowledged that there's something that needs to be addressed here. For most of the last 188 days, we haven't seen much responsiveness from Republicans in Congress. We haven't seen much of a sense of urgency about needing to act on this. So if he feels the need to come out and criticize the Obama administration, even if it's false, because he's feeling some political pressure to act, that might be evidence of potential movement in the future. And we certainly would like to see it. We've been very clear about what we believe needs to be part of the solution.\nWe do believe that the Puerto Rican government should be given access to an orderly restructuring regime. We believe that the Puerto Rican government should also be held accountable for following through on financial reforms, including through an independent fiscal oversight body that would -- or at least some form of independent fiscal oversight that would ensure and hold the government accountable for following through on the reforms.\nWe also believe that a reform of the Medicaid program in Puerto Rico would have positive benefits both for Puerto Rico's fiscal situation but also for the health of the Puerto Rican people. We also believe that providing Puerto Rico access to the earned income tax credit could have a positive impact on Puerto Rico's economy in a way that would also further their efforts to dig out of a pretty deep fiscal hole.\nQ: Related somewhat to Luke's question, in the meeting with the European leaders on Monday, was more substantial intervention in Libya discussed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have a whole lot more to describe about that meeting beyond what you saw on the readout. I can just tell you in general that there is concern among our European allies about the situation in Libya. And as I mentioned in response to Luke's question, President Obama has already demonstrated a commitment and a willingness to order U.S. military action in Libya where necessary to protect the United States. And he continues to recognize that that's a priority and he's willing to take additional military action, if necessary, to protect the United States.\nThere is a strong sense, however, that like in Syria, a military solution cannot be imposed on Libya. And that's why you've seen the United States and our European allies be so strongly supportive of the Government of National Accord and hopeful that that fledgling government can succeed in unifying the country, in trying to restore some order to the chaos that they have sustained, try to institute some order over the security situation, some control over the security situation in Libya, and also begin to address the wide range of economic questions.\nWhen you have sustained the kind of damage to their infrastructure -- both governmental and physical -- in Libya, that's going to have some pretty significant negative consequences for the economy. And that's why there are important decisions that need to be made the GNA about restoring the strength of their economy.\nQ: Lastly in the context of the President's remarks on being prepared probably by the end of the year for an assault on Mosul, I was really struck by The New York Times' article yesterday on the situation in now Anbar Province and in Fallujah where, as you know, your allies, the Iraqi government is laying siege to Fallujah. And many of the civilians are not getting much food. In the Times' story, their reporting showed that the price of a bag of flour in Baghdad at $15 would cost you $750 in Fallujah because of the siege. Is that a tactic the administration feels comfortable with? And would you like to see it replicated against the Sunni civilian population in Mosul?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, Mike, when you are encountering a situation where you have extremists that have essentially set up shop in some of the largest cities in your country, that's going to have a profound and profoundly negative impact on the local population. And one of the things that President Obama spent some time talking about in Saudi Arabia is the need for additional economic support to the Iraqi government for those areas that have been liberated from ISIL.\nRamadi is a good example. That's a country where -- that is a community in Iraq that is still trying to rebuild and recover after enduring many months of ISIL's reign of terror. And for the central government in Iraq to succeed in rebuilding and restoring those communities, they're going to need some economic resources.\nAnd this is a good example of where countries in the region can step up and offer economic assistance to the central government in Iraq that will have a tangible, positive impact on our campaign against ISIL.\nQ: But still in Fallujah, which the government hasn't retaken, they're essentially laying siege to the city, which starves the civilian population.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my point is that obviously the central government in Iraq is dealing with a very difficult situation, and trying to root out ISIL fighters is, of course, going to have a negative impact on the local population. That's the reason it is so important for the Iraqi government, once they have succeeded in driving ISIL out of these communities, to have the support from other countries in the region and other countries around the world for rebuilding and restoring those communities that have endured such great loss.\nSuzanne.\nQ: Josh, Speaker Ryan says he hasn't read the 28 pages that are currently being considered to be declassified from the 9/11 Commission, but he believes that it would not be detrimental for the U.S. and Saudi relationship, saying \"There's the Saudi Arabia then, and now there's the Saudi Arabia now.\" And he also -- he brings up the example of the Saudis cooperating in tracking financing of terrorists. Does the President agree with that assessment that there would not be a negative impact? And if so, is that because the role of the Saudis has changed, or when you take a look at those 28 pages, there really is no \"there\" there in terms of them contributing to the 9/11 attacks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say a couple of things about this. The first thing that comes to mind is that we have made the point that we have seen an improvement in the way the Saudi government has confronted extremism both in their country and around the world since 9/11. That prior to 9/11, there was a sense that the Saudi government didn't recognize the risk of extremist groups operating either in Saudi Arabia or around the world, but since 9/11, we have seen the Saudi government engage with a greater sense of purpose in efforts to counter those extremist activities, and to counter the activities of extremist organizations that are trying to propagate a hateful extremist ideology.\nThat is part of what has made Saudi Arabia a valuable partner of the United States. We have seen tangible Saudi contributions to efforts that strengthen American national security. And the basis of that coordination and cooperation is the basis of the important relationship the United States and Saudi Arabia have today. It's why President Obama has traveled to Saudi Arabia four times as President of the United States -- more than any other President in American history.\nAnd this is a relationship that, while complicated because of the obvious differences between our two countries, there are areas of common ground, particularly as it relates to taking the steps to protect our national security. And the President has worked hard to cultivate that relationship even further.\nI haven't read the 28 pages, so I can't offer up my own assessment about what impact it would have on the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia. Speaker Ryan is certainly entitled to his own opinion, but, as he pointed out, it's an opinion that he has offered up without having read the 28 pages.\nThe process that we're engaged in now is a process whereby people who have read the 28 pages can consider the range of ramifications of releasing that material and declassifying it so that it can be read by the American public. And that's what they're doing. And that's what I think the American people would expect, which is carefully consider how transparent it's possible to be without posing undue risk to our national security.\nI think the other thing that's relevant is that the conclusions of the 9/11 Commission have been made public. They have been declassified. And you saw the -- I don't know if you saw the statement from Governor Kaine and from former Congressman Hamilton about the work of the 9/11 Commission. They indicated that they did read the 28 pages. They described those 28 pages as being \"almost entirely raw, unvetted material that came to the FBI.\" And this is material that the 9/11 Commission did have an opportunity to vet. It is material they did have an opportunity to follow up on. And they discussed the range of interviews that they conducted to pursue the leads that were included in that material.\nAnd the conclusions of the 9/11 Commission is something that we've talked about in here quite extensively. The conclusion of the 9/11 Commission is that Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of al Qaeda funding, but we have found no evidence that the Saudi government, as an institution, or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization.\nSo I think the point is, there is an outside blue ribbon commission that was established to take a look at what contributed to the 9/11 attacks and what reforms we could put in place to prevent an attack like that from ever happening again. They had an opportunity to look carefully at the 28 pages. They had an opportunity to follow up carefully on the information that was included in the 28 pages. And they reached the declassified conclusion that they did not find evidence that the Saudi government as an institution, or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization.\nQ: And just coming off this trip with Saudi Arabia, does the President feel more reassurances that this is not going to be something that is going to impact the relationship?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the best way to describe that -- well, let me say it this way. When the President had an opportunity to sit down with King Salman in Saudi Arabia -- as you know, he spent about two hours talking to him about a range of issues that are critically important to both of our countries -- and King Salman never raised this question about the 28 pages. I think in some ways that is a testament to the wide range of other important issues that the two leaders had to discuss. But I think it also is an indication that there are a range of other things that are more important to the relationship between our two countries than just these 28 pages.\nQ: Should we read into that that the President didn't bring it up, either? The 28 pages?\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct. The President did not bring it up, either.\nQ: And just on another thing. The Senate race here in Maryland -- Van Hollen and Donna Edwards. There are some people who are saying this is turning into identity politics as opposed to based on ideology -- that the way people are voting in Maryland are along racial lines. Does the President have an opinion or an assessment of how that's playing out here --\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's too early to draw that kind of conclusion because people are voting right now, even as we speak. So we can take a look at the results tomorrow and determine whether or not that's an appropriate conclusion to draw, and whether or not there's any evidence to substantiate that claim.\nGardiner.\nQ: Another question for Leader McCarthy. He says that Republicans still have not been given all the answers to their questions on Zika. And so I'm just wondering, is the White House aware of any outstanding questions from Congress on Zika funding? And if so, is there a timeline for answering them? And then just in addition to that -- I might as well just add it now -- there's a complaint that you guys have not stipulated how the money needs to be apportioned between a supplemental for Fiscal Year '16 and the regular appropriations process for Fiscal Year '17.\nMR. EARNEST: To the extent there is a regular appropriations process in Congress.\nQ: But I mean, have you guys -- do you guys have sort of -- how much, specifically, do you need for supplemental in '16 and how much can wait for the '17 approps?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me take your question about providing information to Congress first. As I've noted previously, there have been 48 open public hearings in Congress where questions about Zika have been asked and answered by administration officials. I think that's an indication that there have been a variety of venues where any member of Congress, Democrat or Republican, has had an opportunity to ask a senior administration official a question about Zika.\nSo if there are any unanswered questions about the strategy that the administration has put forward to fight Zika and to protect the American people from Zika, I think it's members of Congress themselves who are responsible for not having answers to those questions because they've had ample opportunity to ask them.\nThat being said, if, after 48 open public hearings, some Republican who hasn't shown up to the hearings continues to have outstanding questions, I'm confident that we can find a way to try to answer the question. That's the first thing.\nI think the second thing is, and I've --\nQ: Just to be clear, you don't know of any outstanding questions, like some list of questions they've sent you that you guys haven't responded to?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of. But, look, I wouldn't put it past some Republican that I've never heard of producing a detailed list of questions that they say has been residing on their website for a couple of weeks.\nSo I think my point is, send the questions over; we'll take a look. But there's no excuse for them having those unanswered questions when you consider that we've already put forward a detailed legislative proposal more than two months ago now. We've already participated in 48 hearings in which questions about Zika have been raised. There have been briefings that have been convened by senior administration officials for both the House and the Senate to discuss this issue.\nSo I guess what I would say for members of Congress who say that they have questions about the administration's Zika strategy, that ignorance is not an excuse. They've had opportunities to ask their questions. There's ample information that's been provided by the administration. And I don't think their constituents are going to find it an acceptable response when there is a widespread media freak-out about the Zika virus that Republicans haven't acted because they didn't get their questions answered.\nYour second question was about?\nQ: Supplemental.\nMR. EARNEST: Supplemental. Well, you've heard from public health professionals that they don't have all the resources that they need right now to do everything that they believe they could do to protect the America people from the Zika virus. Now, part of that is because -- particularly as it relates to our efforts to develop a vaccine -- the government needs to demonstrate a long-term commitment to funding these efforts. The efforts to develop a vaccine and to manufacture that vaccine will include a robust role for the private sector. And the private sector will only fully engage when they see that they have a customer that's committed to buying the product.\nAnd so that's why the delay that we've seen thus far is already problematic. And it's also why the suggestion that Republicans are just going to tie Zika funding to a totally inept budget process is also destined to fail.\nThis is an emergency. Our public health professionals have said as much. And the American people are counting on the Congress to act. And instead, we've gotten bureaucratic excuses from Congress about why they've done nothing. And right now they haven't paid a significant price for that. But at some point, there are going to be direct, specific, serious questions asked to members of Congress -- particularly Republicans -- about why they haven't done anything. And I'm not sure exactly what their explanation will be.\nAnd that's also why, Gardiner, we don't take a lot of solace in Republican proposals to say that they'll attach an emergency appropriation to a regular appropriations bill. What evidence is there that regular appropriations bills are going to pass either house of Congress, let alone both? Republicans in the House haven't even passed a budget, despite the fact that the deadline passed a couple of weeks ago. And Leader McConnell has indicated that it's not clear to him when a budget is ever going to pass the United States Senate.\nSo, again, it's pretty simple exactly what we need here. There is no reason it should be bogged down in partisan politics. There's no question of ideology or principle at stake, other than the basic public health and well-being of the American public. And right now that has fallen victim to a Republican refusal to govern.\nQ: Josh, the Democrats have suggested a supplemental that also includes funding for Flint water, as well as for the opioid crisis. Obviously, these are three crises. But if the Zika virus is truly -- the opioid epidemic, obviously, has been going on for 15 years. If the Zika crisis is truly this summer's public health emergency, why not just a supplemental just about Zika? Why not tell your allies in Congress, look, this goes to the head of the line, just a clean Zika bill, we need it to pass right away?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think ultimately members of Congress are going to have to decide how this moves through the legislative process. We've talked about the urgency that Congress should feel about giving our public health professionals the resources that they need to fight Zika. And we've even presented our own proposal for how we believe Congress should do that, what those resources should look like.\nBut, look, we've also acknowledged that there is a role for Congress to play in helping Flint deal with the situation with their water supply. That's a pretty urgent situation, too. There are some other things that we can do to manage that situation. But there is a role for Congress to play here, and Congress has been AWOL on this one, as well.\nAs it relates to opioids, this is a -- I guess in some ways, the way I would differentiate the opioid crisis from the Zika situation is that we've long passed the point at which the opioid crisis has taken effect. This is a problem that reached crisis proportions quite a while ago. And I do think that's why you've seen bipartisan rhetoric, at least, to making this public health question a priority. The administration has put forward a very specific proposal for how we believe additional resources could be used to fight the opioid epidemic. And we'd encourage Democrats and Republicans to work together on that, as well.\nSo, ultimately, members of Congress are going to have to decide how to address these priorities. This what governing is all about. And the irony of the situation that you've raised is that there is a reason that we can have legitimate discussions and even debates about the appropriate funding levels for the Department of Education. There are some basic questions that go to core political beliefs about the proper role of government. That's not an excuse for congressional inaction, but it is an explanation for why you would have long-running debates about appropriate levels of funding for that agency.\nBut when it comes to giving our public health professionals the resources that they need to fight Zika, or fighting the opioid epidemic, or even helping an American city rebuild their water supply, I don't understand why that would get bogged down in partisanship. There's no reason that should come into conflict with the ideology of anybody who has got the best interests of the American people at heart. It shouldn't. And, unfortunately, in the fact of a Republican Congress that time and time again refuses to do its job, it has.\nQ: I'm sorry to say that The Washington Post had a very good story today about this crisis and how the juggling of funds that has happened within the administration is causing ripple effects and problems across states, across the country. Is that -- can you confirm that? Is that, indeed, happening -- because you have not gotten this emergency funding from Congress specifically from Zika, you are having to do a juggling act that is having ripple effects that is causing problems around the country?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. I happened to see the story, too. And I do think that it did chronicle the significant challenge that our public health professionals and that our emergency responders are facing right now. And they're not getting any help from Congress. In fact, Congress is making the problem worse. Congress has put our emergency response officials in a situation of choosing which oncoming potential disaster to prepare for, as opposed to doing the responsible thing and making sure that our emergency responders have all the resources that they need to protect us.\nKnowing that there's -- here's the thing. When you're an emergency manager, you're often in a situation in which you are responding to a situation that nobody could have ever predicted. No one can predict the exact path of a tornado. Nobody knows exactly how powerful a hurricane will strike the American coast this summer, if at all. Those are emergency situations that can't be predicted in advance, but yet our expectation is that our emergency managers are going to have the necessary resources to deploy a flexible response and to keep us all safe.\nThe question with Zika is, in some ways, not quite as complicated. We have known for months that this was a virus that could threaten the American people, particularly as it relates to pregnant women. And we've known for months what kinds of steps we can take to fight it. There's nothing that we can do on this short of notice to make sure the Zika virus never enters the United States, but there are a whole bunch of things that we can do to blunt its impact. We can better fight the mosquito population -- that by personnel that can quickly respond in certain situations to go and kill mosquitos, that can actually have the effect of protecting an entire community.\nOne of the things that our public health professionals have talked about is that if they detect that an individual has tested positive for Zika, that essentially a strike team should go into that person's neighborhood and try to eradicate as many mosquitos as possible around that person's house to prevent a mosquito from biting that person and spreading the disease to someone else. That's kind of a common-sense approach.\nWe have some strategies to protect people, but they require resources. And that's to say nothing of the kinds of resources that could be invested in diagnostics that would make sure that an individual like I just described has access to a test and can get the results of that test quickly. In some cases, people may not be able to get tested and we won't know whether or not they have the Zika virus.\nAs we've discussed in here before, the vast majority of people who contract the Zika virus won't have any symptoms. But for those who do, they can get a diagnostic test in many situations. But because of constrained lab capacity, it could take them a couple of weeks to get the results. So, again, that couple of weeks' delay could expedite the spread of the disease.\nSo, again, there are a number of things that we know we can do to better protect the American people from the Zika virus, and Congress hasn't given us the resources to do any of them. And to make matters worse, they haven't just restrained resources when it comes to fighting Zika, the government has been forced to try to look for other accounts where our fight against Zika can be enhanced. And that has meant that there are other worthy government programs that are critical to our homeland security that have been negatively affected.\nAnd I can't speak to confirm any of the individual details in that story, but I suspect that those kinds of impacts aren't just being felt in the handful of states that are mentioned in that story, they're having an impact in states all across the country.\nQ: Last one on this, Josh. If there is a child that gets microcephaly from a domestically acquired infection, will that be on the Republicans' watch and their responsibility?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what will be true is what you heard Dr. Fauci say when he stood at this podium a couple of weeks ago. He said made clear that they don't have -- that our public health professionals do not have all of the resources that they need to do everything that they can and should be doing right now to prepare for Zika. And that's going to have consequences.\nNow, as I said before, Gardiner, I don't think there's a strategy that would prevent every incident of Zika in the United States. But there are surely steps that we should already be taking to minimize the spread of the disease later this year. And every day that goes by, where Congress makes excuses, that's a day lost to preparing for the Zika fight.\nAnd I've said this a couple of times, and it's true -- there will be a day when I'm going to come out here and I'm going to do a briefing, and the headlines in the newspapers and the breaking news alerts from all the television stations are going to be worrying about the impact of the Zika virus in the United States. And we're going to spend a lot of time talking about all the steps that our public health professionals have taken to try to fight this disease. We're going to talk about all the steps that the administration has proposed, dating back to February, to prepare for this situation. And I don't know what Republicans are going to say when they come face-to-face with their constituents who are wondering why Congress hasn't done a thing.\nBill.\nQ: Did the 28 pages come up in any of the conversations between administration officials, including the President, and any other members of the Saudi delegation?\nMR. EARNEST: I think, Bill, it would be hard for me to account for all of those conversations. Obviously there were -- even in just the one bilateral meeting that the pool had the opportunity to briefly observe when we first arrived in Saudi Arabia, there were about 20 U.S. and Saudi officials in the same room. So that's a lot of different conversations to account for. What I can tell you is that it did not come up between the President and the King, and I'm not aware of it coming up between any other senior U.S. official and their Saudi counterpart.\nQ: You didn't hear it discussed?\nMR. EARNEST: I did not.\nRich.\nQ: Josh, in regards to North Korea, when the President said to CBS that the United States is spending time positioning our missile defense systems, is that in response to recent provocations to the last few months, or is that part of this broader pivot to Asia?\nMR. EARNEST: That's a good question, Rich. This is actually something that our Department of Defense has been doing on the orders of the President for at least a couple of years now. There were a number of anti-ballistic missile capabilities that were moved to Alaska in 2014. We have increased the deployment of naval assets in the Asia Pacific as a part of the Asia pivot, but that also has enhanced our ability to counter ballistic missiles in that region of the world.\nOver the last several years, there's been equipment that's been deployed to places like Japan and Guam that could be effective in protecting the United States and our allies from ballistic missiles. The United States is in discussions right now with our allies in South Korea about the potential deployment of something called a THAAD battery. This is essentially an anti-ballistic missile system that could be useful in protecting our allies in South Korea from a ballistic missile fired by the North Koreans.\nSo this is not a response to recent provocations from North Korea, but rather a response to the threat that has emanated from North Korea for quite some time now. I think it's an indication of the value in planning ahead and the strategic approach that President Obama and his national security team have taken to protecting the American people in the face of the North Korean threat.\nQ: Has that strategic approach changed at all since the fourth nuclear test in January and then the submarine or the apparent submarine launch of a ballistic missile this past weekend?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any -- let me take that back. I can think of one change. It was only in response to a more recent test from the North Koreans that the United States and South Korea began our dialogue about the potential deployment of an anti-ballistic missile battery in South Korea. That was -- the beginning of those conversations was a response to a specific and recent event.\nBut other than that, I can't think of any other responses that I can tell you about. Obviously, there are a number of things that our national security apparatus is engaged in on a daily basis to protect the American people. And when necessary, they can make changes that reflect the threat emanating from anywhere around the world, including in North Korea. But as it relates to things that I can talk about publicly, I don't have any other examples for you other than discussions about the deployment of this THAAD battery to South Korea.\nQ: Is the administration confident in its ability to defend allies in the region on the Korean Peninsula? And are sanctions working here?\nMR. EARNEST: Rich, I can tell you that the President is quite confident in the defense capabilities that we have to protect the American people and to protect our allies in the Asia Pacific.\nIt means we need to continue to monitor the threat that's emanating from North Korea. It means that we need to be nimble and adjust our strategy accordingly. But there has been a significant commitment of resources and a lot of time spent considering how we can best arrange those resources to protect our allies and protect the American people, and that work is ongoing.\nAs it relates to the impact of sanctions, we have not yet seen the desired change in behavior that is long overdue. But what we have succeeded in doing is working with the international community to ramp up the pressure on the North Korean government even further. And that includes by targeting specific aspects of the North Korean economy that we know were used to fund their ballistic missile program. And we did succeed in working closely with the Chinese and other members of the U.N. Security Council to pass those sanctions and to implement them in a way that maximizes the impact on the North Koreans.\nSo the North Korean government has been isolated for quite some time. That's had a terrible impact on the North Korean population, and it is solely as a result of the management decisions that are being made by the North Korean government that that pressure has only tightened in recent months as a result of the stepped-up provocations from the North Koreans.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The House plans to vote this week to reauthorize the D.C. School Choice program, something the President has opposed. Will he veto that legislation if it reaches him?\nMR. EARNEST: Dave, I know we have expressed our concerns about similar legislation in the past, but I haven't seen the specific proposal that has been put forward. I know that our team has taken a look at it. But hopefully in the next couple of days we can give you a better answer in terms of our final position on it.\nQ: On another matter, the House Armed Services chairman has floated a proposal to rein in the size of the National Security Council and to possibly make the NSC director subject to congressional confirmation. It look like it wouldn't affect your administration by the time it was enacted, but do you have thoughts on it? Do you have a reaction to it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly makes me think that Republicans in Congress aren't too bullish about the prospects of a Republican succeeding President Obama. But you can ask them about that, I guess.\nI did see that the proposal includes limiting the size of the National Security Council. I think it warrants mentioning that under the leadership of the current National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, the size of the National Security Council has actually shrunk 10 percent in just the last 18 months or so. And that's based on her own initiative to try to streamline the National Security Council and make its actions even more efficient than it already is.\nSo this is something that we're already focused on here. I have also seen that -- those proposals suggest that the National Security Council staff should be capped at 50 people. I might note that the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee is larger than that. That seems like a rather curious apportionment of resources when you consider the important work that's done at the National Security Council every day. So obviously we've got some concerns with their proposals.\nQ: I'm sure you've seen that the rationale for this proposal is to give the Congress and the Pentagon more leverage in policy disputes with the White House over military policy. Do you have a comment on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, considering that this Congress doesn't seem like they're at all prepared to pass a budget for our military this year; considering that Congress has for the last two years refused to even consider seriously an authorization for the use of military force; and considering that there are a range of spending reforms that the Department of Defense has repeatedly put forward only to see them be denied by Congress -- I saw a story while we were traveling about continued opposition in Congress to considering another round of base closures. These are base closures that the Department of Defense assesses would have a positive impact on our national security because it would allow for the more efficient deployment of military resources around the country. But Republicans, and some Democrats, probably, have voiced some opposition to those reforms.\nI think all of that makes clear that there are too many members of Congress that don't take very seriously their responsibility to engage in a legitimate debate about policies that are critical to our national security. That's why I'm surprised to hear that some of them are seeking more authority over those decisions that they have thus far refused to make.\nJC.\nQ: How concerned is Chancellor Merkel -- or did she express her concerns to the President while he was there that Schengen agreement regarding travel within the EU, an essential part of the entire EU, that would remain in place despite some of the reactions had by some of the political activities that have gone on in terms of -- vis-а-vis the refugee crisis going on right now?\nMR. EARNEST: JC, I don't have more details to share. They're private conversations. And for her government's view of that policy, I'd refer you to my German counterpart. He's a nice guy. I got a chance to see him over the weekend. (Laughter.) So I'm sure he'd be happy to try to answer your question.\nI think what I can tell you more generally, though, is that Chancellor Merkel and the President had an opportunity to consult with the leaders of the UK, France, and Italy yesterday. And part of those discussions focused on the need for greater information-sharing to ensure that we're working together to combat homeland security threats to all of our nations. And that level of information-sharing can and should improve. And doing so would improve our national security. Okay?\nPam, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Just on the Zika funding, there were Republicans talking about $1.1 billion last week. Would that be enough to at least combat the problem this summer if that was the agreement?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, we'd have to take a look at what they're proposing. And I would note that that's barely half of what we've indicated is needed. So I'm not going to rule it out until we've had an opportunity to take a close look at it. But right now our concern isn't just focused on the fact that it's about half of what our public health professionals say that we need to effectively fight this fight. Right now our concern is that that funding is tied to a moribund appropriations process.\nSo, again, there is very little prospect for the passage of appropriations bills before the fall at the earliest. The onset of Zika is going to be felt several months before that. And that's why we believe Congress needs to find a way to act before then, as well.\nQ: This is College Signing Day. Do we know yet where the First Daughter is going to college?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that. But once we have an announcement to make, we'll make sure you all are read in. All right?\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:30 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-04-26", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

Chabot, R-OH, and 11 cosponsors)\nThe Administration is committed to helping entrepreneurs and small business owners access the capital they need to innovate, grow their enterprises, and create jobs. H.R. 4498, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups (HALOS) Act, seeks to further these objectives by creating a new exemption to the prohibition of general solicitation for companies issuing private securities. Specifically, the bill would require the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revise Regulation D so that the prohibition against general solicitation does not apply to presentations or communications made at an event sponsored by certain organizations.\nAlthough H.R. 4498 seeks to increase opportunities for companies to access investment capital, the Administration is concerned that the bill does not properly weigh the need for, and importance of, appropriate investor protections. Title II of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act requires that issuers selling securities in private markets through general solicitation take \"reasonable steps\" to verify that all purchasers are \"accredited investors.\" This requirement helps ensure that unsophisticated investors do not make investments when they may not understand the attendant risks. Creating a new exemption to this requirement may make it easier for companies to access necessary capital, but providing such an exemption comes at the cost of potentially increasing undue risk for certain investors.\nAdditionally, the SEC already has sought to alleviate some of the burden on startups and other small companies by exempting them from the \"reasonable steps\" requirement when the companies have a pre-existing, substantive relationship with the potential investors or have contacted the potential investors through a personal network before making a general solicitation. The SEC determined that these relationships or communications were a sensible substitute for the \"reasonable steps\" otherwise required to assure that all purchasers were accredited investors, and did not unreasonably undermine investor protection.\nThe JOBS Act charged the SEC with implementing its titles through a robust rulemaking process, and the agency has done so by taking into account both the importance of access to capital for companies, as well as the importance of investor protection, both of which are essential for a well-functioning marketplace. Any legislation that seeks to facilitate greater capital formation by clarifying or amending Federal securities law should similarly take both of these considerations into account. We look forward to working with the Congress on this legislation as it moves forward.", "timestamp": "2016-04-26", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 4498 – Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118145", "text": "Expanding opportunity for more students, especially disadvantaged students, to enroll and succeed in college is vital to building a strong economy and a strong middle class. The chance of a child born in the bottom household income quintile making it to the top quintile nearly quadruples with a college degree. Yet fewer than 10 percent of those born into low-income households earn a bachelor's degree by age 25, compared with over 50 percent of students born into upper-income households. Decades of research have shown how higher education offers large benefits to students in terms of labor market earnings, health, and happiness - and to the community at large.\nThat's why President Obama has made historic progress around college opportunity, affordability, and completion by doubling investments in Pell Grants and tax credits; made student loans more affordable by cutting interest rates and allowing borrowers to cap student loan payments at 10 percent of income; made access to financial aid and college information simpler and faster; and promoted innovation and competition to bring down costs and improve college quality. Today, more students are graduating college than ever, and student loan defaults, delinquencies, and forbearances are on the decline. Through the President and First Lady's Call-to-Action on College Opportunity, hundreds of schools, organizations, and counselors have reported that they have already helped students access more than $5 billion in financial aid, enrolling 1 million more students in college, and setting 10 million more students on track to complete on time within the decade.\nThe Administration and the country have made significant progress to ensure more students can access an affordable, high-quality college education and succeed. Each spring, however, the buzz around the thousands of student-athletes deciding where to play college football overshadows the momentous decision tens of millions of students make to pursue a postsecondary degree. Working hard in school should be celebrated just as much as working hard on the field. That is why First Lady Michelle Obama will be celebrating  National College Signing Day as part of her  Better Make Room campaign. Last October, as part of her  Reach Higher initiative, the First Lady launched Better Make Room, a public awareness campaign targeted at Generation Z, or young people ages 14-19, to celebrate education, change the national conversation, and give students the tools and resources they need - from the FAFSA to the  College Scorecard - to continue their education past high school. The Better Make Room campaign engages actors, singers, and sports icons in celebrating students for pursuing their higher education.\nDuring her College Signing Day event, the First Lady will honor graduating high school seniors who will go on to pursue a postsecondary degree. During her  College Signing Day event at New York City's Harlem Armory, the First Lady will celebrate college enrollment and success alongside more than 4,000 high school students. In addition, over 1,000 communities around the country will host College Signing Day events to celebrate student success. Mrs. Obama first announced her Reach Higher initiative at a College Signing Day event in San Antonio, TX in 2014, and last year led a call to action culminating in 600 events around the country and her own celebration on Detroit, MI. On April 29, Education Secretary John B. King Jr. will give remarks in Washington, D.C. at the College Signing Day celebration hosted by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education.\nEnsuring Every Student has a Fair Shot at a High-Quality Education\nToday, we celebrate not only the start of a college education for many students, but also the progress that our nation has made to ensure that all hard-working students have a fair shot at earning their degrees and credentials. That's why the President set a north-star goal for the country to once again lead the world in college attainment. To achieve this bold goal for college completion, ensure that America's students and workers receive the education and training needed for the jobs of today and tomorrow, and provide more security for the middle class, this Administration has worked to make college more accessible, affordable, and attainable for all American families.\n• Making College More Affordable by Doubling Investments in Pell and Tax Credits. Since the President took office, we have  increased the maximum Pell award by over $1,000, and for the first time, tied aid to inflation to maintain its value. These efforts have  cut the cost of college by about $3,700 for over 8 million students last year, and resulted in 2 million additional Pell Grants awarded to students each year since the President took office. This Administration also established the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), which provides a maximum credit of $2,500 per year—or up to $10,000 over four years—to expand and replace the Hope higher education credit. The bipartisan tax and budget agreement signed into law in December 2015 made the AOTC permanent. In 2016, the AOTC will cut taxes by over $1,800, on average, for nearly 10 million families.\n• Making the FAFSA Available Earlier and a New College Scorecard to Support Families to Make Strong College Choices. To help more students access over $180 billion available annually in Federal financial aid and millions more in state, institutional, and private scholarships, this Administration has simplified the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and cut the time it takes to complete the form by two-thirds. To further  streamline and simplify the financial aid process, the Administration has made the form available 3 months earlier - starting on October 1, 2016 - to ensure students can apply for aid earlier and have the most accurate financial aid eligibility information through the FAFSA and  College Scorecard when it matters most, as they search for, apply to, and select a college.\n• Improving College Choice and Performance. For the first time, students and their families have access to comprehensive reliable data on college costs, graduation rates, loan repayment rates, and labor market outcomes in one easily accessible source. Students can use the  College Scorecard to find a good-value school where they can pursue their educational and career goals while others in the public - policymakers, schools, parents, teachers, researchers - can use the data to help support colleges in improving their performance and serving students better.\nThis Administration has also worked to ensure schools are accountable to the public and that they serve students well. These efforts include cracking down on career colleges with unscrupulous practices; since 2009, financial aid going to for-profits has decreased by 36 percent while enrollment at those institutions has dropped 25 percent. These complete efforts to create pathways to allow defrauded students to get loan relief, and implementing the \"Gainful Employment\" rules that require poor-performing programs at career colleges-which are currently leaving over 800,000 students with debts they cannot afford-to either improve performance or lose eligibility for federal financial aid; and advancing legislation that would reward colleges that successfully enroll and graduate students from all backgrounds through the College Opportunity and Graduation Bonus program, which would recognize and provide a bonus to high-performing colleges that enroll and graduate a significant number of low- and moderate-income students, as demonstrated by high graduation rates for Pell Grant recipients and low cohort default rates, and encourage all institutions to improve their performance.\n• Strengthening Community Colleges. The Administration also recognizes that America's more than 1,100 community colleges, serving 43 percent of all undergraduates, are the backbone of the nation's postsecondary education and training system and are critical to ensuring all Americans have an opportunity to earn a quality, affordable degree or credential. This is why President Obama announced  America's College Promise to make two years of community college free for hard-working students in his 2015 State of the Union. Since then, Sen. Baldwin (WI) and Rep. Bobby Scott (VA) introduced America's College Promise Act of 2015 at the federal level while at least 25 new states, communities, and schools are  driving progress by announcing their own free community college programs. Administration has also invested $70 billion in community colleges through Pell Grants, Title III, Title V, and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training program. Building on these investments, the White House announced $100 million in  America's Promise Grants to expand tuition-free community college programs that connect Americans to in-demand jobs.\n• Empowering More Students to Earn College Degrees. This Administration has worked to open more doors to students, particularly for non-traditional, low-income, and underrepresented students. Since the President took office, over one million more black and Hispanic students enrolled in college. More independent students, older students, and parents are also enrolling in college for the first time. Meanwhile, more students are graduating college than ever before; there have already been well over 27 million college degrees and credentials awarded since the President took office. Building on this record, the Administration  proposed new Pell investments to help students accelerate progress towards their degrees and increase their likelihood of on-time completion. These two proposals include Pell for Accelerated Completion, which would allow full-time students to take courses in a third semester, and On-Track Pell Bonus, which offers $300 for students to take 15-credits, which would accelerate progress towards a degree. To further decrease costs and increase completion rates, the Administration has encouraged greater innovation and a stronger evidence base around effective strategies to promote college success through 42 First in the World grants that fund and test interventions and 15 experimental sites that pilot reforms to existing higher education policies.\n• Ensuring Every Student Has the Resources to Manage Her Debt Successfully. This Administration recognizes that ensuring all students have the opportunity to invest in their education requires a student loan system that is both affordable and easy to navigate. This is why we have eliminated subsidies to banks making student loans and transitioned to 100 percent Direct Loans, reinvesting billions into the Federal Pell Grant program and strengthening the financial aid infrastructure. To ensure student loans are manageable, the Administration has cut student loan interest rates, saving a typical student $1,000 over the life of loans borrowed this year, and began implementing the  Student Aid Bill of Rights to strengthen loan servicing and make it easier for students to access the information they need to choose repayment plans. The Administration has also capped student loan payments at 10 percent of income for current and future students through the Pay As You Earn repayment plan. Already, nearly 5 million Direct Loan borrowers have enrolled in income-driven repayment plans - including Pay As you Earn - a 140 percent increase from December 2013. Meanwhile, defaults, delinquencies, and forbearances are on the decline.\nCelebrating Progress on College Opportunity under the President and First Lady's Call to Action\nEach student's success is a result of collective effort; it is possible for students to reach this significant milestone of choosing a college when they and countless others in the community-family, friends, teachers, counselors, schools, colleges, policymakers, and higher education organizations-join in the efforts to make each educational opportunity count. That's why we are also celebrating College Opportunity commitment-makers' tremendous progress and unity around making a college degree more within reach for students.\nAs part of the White House College Opportunity Days of Action on  January 16, 2014 and  December 4, 2014, the President and First Lady announced over 700 commitments to expand opportunity for more students to enroll and succeed in college. Collectively, these efforts will substantially grow the number of college graduates; expand students' college opportunities and support them to make strong college choices that meet fit their educational goals and career aspirations; and strengthen the pipeline to college and improve college remediation to ensure students from all backgrounds are prepared to succeed in college.\nAltogether, the collective actions taken by college and system presidents, education and community leaders, and organizations have accelerated progress in supporting students to and through college. These commitments have already:\n*  Increased the number of college graduates: These new networks of colleges and organizations are devoted to producing more college graduates who are career-ready and are defining plans to help hundreds of thousands more students complete a college degree or credential by 2025.\nThese commitment-makers report already setting more than 10 million students on track to graduate on time by 2025, which would help those families save at least $2 billion on tuition collectively. A significant part of these efforts involve reforms to remediation, which are already on track to save over 350,000 students from taking remediation courses unnecessarily.\n*  Enhanced College Readiness Through K-16 Partnerships: Partnerships among high schools, community colleges, and four-year colleges and universities are setting goals and pursuing collaborative strategies to help over 100,000 more students become college-ready by tying together academic expectations, student support systems, and community resources.\nAlready, the commitment-makers report adding $135 million in new investments to higher education to strengthen collective work on college access, affordability, and success. The work of all commitment-makers has catalyzed more than 40,000 new partnerships between high schools, colleges, counselors, access groups, non-profits, and businesses.\n*  Improved Access to Highly Trained School Counselors: Tens of thousands more students will gain access to high-quality college advising through the training of more than 5,000 school counselors and advisors in high-need districts and schools.\nCommitment-makers reported helping students submit at least 1 million additional FAFSAs and access more than $5 billion in financial aid, and expect to multiply this impact ten-fold by 2025. Commitment-makers also reported helping students submit at least 6 million more college applications, and enrolling about 1 million more students in college.\n• Strengthened STEM Education: Institutions and organizations have made more than 100 individual commitments towards the President's goals to graduate an additional 1 million STEM graduates and prepare 100,000 excellent K-12 STEM teachers over a decade.\nOver 45 institutions reported that they have set an additional 100,000 STEM majors on track to graduate, which projects to graduating 600,000 more STEM majors by 2025.\nSustained Efforts to Expand College Opportunity and Increase Student Success\nNew efforts to expand college opportunity include:\n• More Exposure to College Campuses that Serve Students Well. As part of its mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, Google is making over 100 college and career tours available through Google Expeditions starting today. In collaboration with the First Lady's Reach Higher initiative, students can virtually visit college campuses all across the country, making them more accessible to students everywhere. Students can also take Career Expeditions to help them explore future careers by showing them a virtual day in the life of professionals including a computer scientist, veterinarian, and many more. Teachers can choose from a library of more than 150 Expeditions, making them easy to incorporate into existing curriculum. Schools can sign up to bring Google Expeditions to their schools.\n• Direct Engagement to Ensure Every Student Can Access Better Information to Select and Enroll in College. Admissions officers from the Coalition for Access, Affordability, and Success - a group of nearly 100 diverse institutions united in improving the college admissions process for all students - will conduct outreach at 500 high schools, community-based organizations, and community libraries where their students and other local community college students can benefit significantly from early engagement and greater support in the college preparation process. These college application outreach sessions will be offered this summer and fall and will include tutorials on applying for Federal financial aid and using tools like the College Scorecard to find good-value schools.\n• Access to Mentors and a Support Network.Salesforce.org is committing to developing and bringing to market a unique mobile and social mentorship solution to drive higher student admission and graduation rates. With a focus on driving long-term student success, the app will give students the ability to connect with a network that will demonstrate the behaviors, skills and practices needed to succeed in post-secondary education and beyond. A prototype of the application was created by Salesforce.org in collaboration with teachers and counselors as part of First Lady Michelle Obama's Reach Higher initiative.\n• Better College Preparation Resources and College Application Support.This year, ACT will provide millions of students and families with information and tips to prepare for college. ACT's commitment to equity in learning can be found in its efforts to increase access to ACT resources—through ACT testing fee-waivers, free ACT Kaplan Online Prep Live and ACT Online Prep for low-income students, and free ACT Profile accounts, where students, families and educators can use free digital tools to help students plan and prepare for college and career readiness and success.\n• Early Access to Financial Aid. Raise.me is a social enterprise focused on expanding access to higher education by improving the impact of financial aid. Rather than waiting until the end of high school to earn scholarships, which often happens too late to impact a student's college ambitions or choices, Raise.me enables students to earn scholarships from nearly 150 partner colleges, starting as early as 9th grade, for doing what best prepares them to succeed, whether that's getting good grades, volunteering in the community or joining an extracurricular activity. As part of College Signing Day, Raise.me has committed to serving over 250,000 low income, minority and first generation students during the 2016-2017 academic year and will launch a new dashboard for community-based organizations that work with students on college preparedness.\n• Financial Literacy and More College Savings. Napkin Finance breaks down financial concepts in a simple, engaging, and visual way in 30 seconds or less. Most importantly, it teaches teens and young adults how to make smart money decisions and build a lifetime of financial well-being. For the First Lady's Better Make Room initiative, Napkin Finance has created a course with \"napkins\" that prepare students for the financial challenges of a college education. The Better Make Room collaboration with Napkin Finance will inspire and empower teens to fill out the FAFSA, learn more about options for paying for college, understand how student loans work, and encourage ongoing engagement with the Reach Higher platform.\n• More Inclusive Communities.Facing History and Ourselves works to end bigotry through education, reaching more than 4 million secondary school students each year across the globe. Facing History and Reach Higher will partner around their shared mission of empowering U.S. high school students to create a better future for themselves and their communities. In Fall 2016, we will launch a co-branded national public service announcement campaign to showcase inspiring students who've learned that they can make a difference in the world and plan to continue their education as a means of doing so. The organizations will also partner to involve high school students in online games and activities through Facing History and the First Lady's Better Make Room campaign.\n• Civic-Minded Students Dedicated to Public Service. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), the Jefferson Awards Foundation (JAF), and PVBLIC have partnered to develop a digital campaign highlighting public service as a pathway to higher education that supports the Better Make Room campaign. Students involved in youth programs with Jefferson Awards Foundation and CNCS' Stars of Service will be featured in PSA's developed by PVBLIC. JAF's Students In Action program powers teenagers to discover their public service passions and have maximum measurable impact. More than 4,000 students are trained each year with leadership training using civic engagement as a pathway to success in life. 99% of SIA students graduate high school, and 71% go to four year colleges. JAF's GlobeChangers and LEAD360 youth programs also engage students in public service and put them on the path to higher education. CNCS, the Federal agency that engages millions of Americans in service and in developing community solutions through AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, and the Social Innovation Fund, administers Stars of Service, an award launched by President Obama to recognize young people who are outstanding examples of volunteering and service.\n• Spreading the College Signing Day Message. American Eagle Outfitters, a global specialty retailer offering high-quality, on-trend clothing, accessories and personal care products, will feature the College Signing Day on its digital billboards in Times Square and will help spread the word to target demographics during the event across its social platforms. These efforts builds on American Eagle Outfitters' strong commitment to youth empowerment and education.\n• Making Room for College Dreams. College visits, freshman orientation and graduation ceremonies are important milestones in any student's life, especially for low-income and first-generation college students. Unfortunately, many high school students lack the support network and financial resources required to achieve these milestones. That's why Airbnb is teaming up with Better Make Room and youth development organizations like Summer Search and United Negro College Fund to help remove these hidden barriers and travel costs associated with attending college. In 2015, Airbnb began working with Summer Search to provide free accommodations for students and their families who are visiting colleges, attending freshman orientation weekends, and going to graduation ceremonies. Initially focused on serving students in New York and San Francisco, Airbnb is expanding the program in 2016 to reach all Summer Search students in Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia, New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area. In addition, Airbnb in partnership with United Negro College Fund, will provide UNCF scholars and their families with free accommodations for freshman \"move-in\" weekends. Freshman orientation weekend is a particularly critical time of transition for any student - especially for those who are the first in their family to attend college or those that have not travelled extensively beyond their hometown or neighborhood. Airbnb and UNCF will launch these efforts for students starting classes at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in Atlanta, Georgia.\n• Stronger Support for Teachers. Dozens of Facebook employees have worked with Reach Higher, IDEO's Teacher's Guild, and other leading nonprofits to develop new solutions for teachers to help students get to and through college. Facebook employees provided engineering, design, and business support to teachers from across the country. Facebook will also host a hack-a-thon to bring the top ideas to life.", "timestamp": "2016-04-26", "title": "Fact Sheet: Celebrating Progress in Expanding College Opportunity for Every Student on College Signing Day"}
{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120893", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: This has been pretty exciting, huh? (Applause.) I am so, so happy to be here with you guys. Look how good you all look! (Applause.) You look so good! (Applause.)\nAll right, let me start by thanking a few people. I want to thank Melissa and Ben for being here and for their amazing introduction.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!\nMRS. OBAMA: I love every single one of you! Every single one of you! (Applause.) I'm so proud of you all. (Applause.)\nBut I also want to thank La La and Sway and all of MTV for co-hosting this. You know they put this together for you all? Do you know that? (Applause.)\nBut most of all, I want to give a huge shout-out to all the amazing young people who are here today because just -- I want you to take a moment because you saw what just happened on this stage. You understand how many people it took to put this together. We did this because of you all. (Applause.) You all are the reasons we did this. Melissa, Ben, Allan Houston, Sway, La La, Carmelo -- I mean, all of us are here today because we are beyond proud of you. (Applause.)\nI want you all to listen to this: These Grammy Award winners, these NBA All-Stars, these Hollywood celebrities all wanted to be a part of this day. I called, they came. They love me, but they love you even more. They want to celebrate your achievements. (Applause.)\nSo I want you to take this in, because no matter what path any of us on this stage took to our success, we all know that completing your education past high school is the most important thing you can do to reach your dreams. That's why we're here.\nSo while you all might be in awe of us, let me tell you, we are in awe of you. (Applause.) Because we know how much work it took for you to get to this point. We know that you have been studying. (Applause.) We know how early you had to wake up every morning to either catch the bus or walk to school. (Applause.) We know about all those applications and essays, all those FAFSA forms you had to complete to make it to this day. It wasn't just a notion! (Applause.)\nBut we also know that even in those moments when you were tired and a little frustrated, maybe filled with a little doubt, that you never gave up. (Applause.) You never stopped fighting for your dreams. And you did it! Every single one of you in this room is going to college! (Applause.) Man! Look at you all! And that's really what College Signing Day is all about. It's about celebrating your academic achievements. Listen to this. We are celebrating education up in here! (Applause.)\nWe wanted to shine a big, bright light on outstanding young people like you because, until recently, signing days have been exclusively associated with big-time athletes, big contracts, and even bigger money. The country spends weeks anticipating which players are going to sign with which teams. Now, we love that picture of the high school or college student holding up their jersey to the cheers of the nation, and while we all love the excitement and drama of sports signing days, we all believe here that college signing days deserve the same level of attention. (Applause.)\nSee, we believe that all the adoration and attention should not just be focused on a few amazing football or basketball players. The focus should be on young people like you. (Applause.) We want people to be sitting on the edges of their couches, wondering where you're going to college. (Applause.) We believe that the entire nation should be looking up to you all as our heroes and role models. (Applause.)\nSo that's why we're all here today. And let me tell you, I am so thrilled that College Signing Day is catching on nationwide. Two years ago when we started this, there were just a few dozen communities who were holding events like this. Last year, it was 600 communities that had a College Signing Day. And today -- today there are more than 1,000 signing day events happening all across the country. (Applause.)\nSo understand that you all are part of a movement. And please understand today, this is your day. So I really want you to take a moment to just soak it in. Think about everybody who came parading out here for you. We are so proud of everything you've achieved, and we don't take the struggle for granted. (Applause.) So soak it in and enjoy it.\nBut then, here's the thing, the minute you get to college this fall, I want you to get right back to work. (Applause.) Because today is not the end of your journey -- it's just the beginning. Remember, the goal, the ultimate goal here isn't just getting into college; the goal is to finish and get that degree, okay? (Applause.)\nAnd trust me, you guys, there are going to be times when that is going to seem like an impossible task -- and I know that from my own experience. My parents did not go to college. So while they loved and supported me unconditionally, they couldn't answer any of my questions or give me advice about how to succeed on a college campus. They had never done it.\nSo when I arrived at Princeton my freshman year -- (applause) -- and imagine, little miss South Side of Chicago girl on Princeton's campus. Believe me, I had a lot of catching up to do. I didn't know anybody. I didn't know what classes to take. Shoot, I didn't even have the right size sheets for my bed. (Laughter.) Because I didn't realize the beds in college are extra-long. (Laughter.) I was homesick. I was anxious. But after a couple of months, I had to get it together. I had to make a decision. And I decided that I needed to step up and own my college education, just like I owned my high school education. (Applause.)\nAnd I realized that in order to do that, I couldn't just rely on myself. I needed to ask for help. So I started reaching out to anybody I could -- to professors, I started making friends with the upperclassmen, they became my mentors. And believe me, ya'll, I studied like I'd never studied before.\nAnd soon enough, I kind of got the college thing down. I was feeling myself a little bit. (Applause.) But the one reason I share my experience with you all is because I am no different from you all. My parents didn't have money. I went to public school. We didn't have a whole lot of examples to follow, but I know that if I can do it, you can do it, too. I know that in my heart. (Applause.)\nAnd I want you to hear that from me. I want you to hear it from your First Lady: As long as you're willing to put in the work, you're going to make this happen. You can do this. (Applause.)\nSo I just want to end by giving you a few pieces of wisdom that I want you to really listen to and think about, because I know how you're going to feel when you get on campus. The first reality is that I want you to be focused. You have to be focused in your classes. What does that mean? You've got to be on time. You've got to show up every day. Just think about the cost, per day, that you are paying for class. Do not miss class. Pay attention. Take careful notes. Raise your hand. Ask questions when you're confused. Don't be afraid to be wrong, because that was me -- I didn't even want to hear my voice in class. I don't want that for you. Don't be afraid. In college, you can't just sit back and space out. You have to be an active participant.\nSecond, I want you to be engaged in campus life. If you are sitting in your dorm room too much by yourself, you're not doing the right thing. You've got to get out and join clubs, extracurricular activities, just like you did in high school. Find internships, as Damon said, and other opportunities that are going to get you ready for summer jobs, jobs after college, graduate school, and all of life after that. You have to go after those opportunities, because kids who are prepared know -- they're hustling to get their summer internships in line. So I want you to get on campus and be prepared for that.\nThe last thing I want you to do -- and this is no small piece of advice -- ask for help. Ask for help, ya'll. (Applause.) And don't wait. The minute you start to feel like you're falling behind, the minute you find yourself struggling, you absolutely have to ask for help. And remember this: No one gets through college alone, and you're not supposed to. You're not supposed to know anything when you get there. That's why there are countless people on your campuses whose job it is to help you succeed. You're going to have RAs and deans. You're going to have a writing center, a tutoring center, counseling centers -- they're all just waiting for you to come to them for help.\nBut here's the thing. In college, they're not going to come knocking on your door. That's just the difference. They are not going to be looking for you. It's going to be up to you to go knocking on their door. And let me tell you this: If the first person that answers that door is not friendly or helpful -- which they may not be, there are a lot of people that don't want to help -- then ask somebody ask. And I want you to keep asking until you find somebody that's going to get you in the right place. Know that -- you're going to hit walls. There are going to be people who are going to turn their back. You keep asking, because if you go to college, there is somebody there who is going to help you get where you need to be.\nAnd if you all do all of this, then I know you will succeed. I am so sure of it. And then when that day comes, and you find yourself walking around campus like you own the place, which you all will be doing, okay -- (laughter and applause) -- then I don't want you to just pat yourself on the back and say good job. I want you to reach back and help other young people like you find their path to success. (Applause.) That's your job now. You all are mentors. And at this stage in the game, you all know somebody just like you who's not thinking about college. They don't think they're college material. Maybe it's a younger brother or sister, or a kid down the street -- they're just like you. I want you to show them that your story can be their story, too. And that starts right now, today.\nSo we're going to do a little making-this-all-go-viral stuff right now. (Applause.) So I want to know if anybody here has an iPhone -- yes, I know you all do. Come on, don't act like you're not carrying this stuff around. All the selfies you ask me to take. (Laughter.) So I want you all right now, get your phones out, you have permission to take out your phone -- everybody, take your phone out, and I want you to take a selfie right now in your college gear. Take it right now. I did this, this morning -- that's why I'm wearing my t-shirt. My husband did it this morning. Every athlete and celebrity here today is going to do it, too. And together, we're going to make this event go viral.\nSo after you take your selfie, I want you to tweet it, post it, Instagram it, whatever you all do -- I don't know all the little things you do. (Laughter.) Use the hashtag #CollegeSigningDay. And if we do this, we're going to show everyone out there in the world, we want to show them who you are. And we want you to brag a little bit about all that you've achieved, okay? Can you do that? We're already trending out there in the ether. With your help, we can get this over the top.\nAnd then next fall, at college, get out there, and continue to make your families proud, your community proud. Make your President proud. (Applause.) Make your First Lady proud of you. (Applause.) But most of all, make yourselves proud. (Applause.) I know you all can do it. I love you all with all of my heart. I am going to be cheering for you. Every step of the way I'm going to be praying for you. And I cannot wait to see all that you're going to achieve and do with your lives. I'm so proud.\nNow, we've got one more thing. I am now excited to turn things over to some of the most talented people I know -- the folks who, along with College Humor, helped me debut my rap career -- (applause) -- by taping a rap of me in the White House. Let's give it up for Jay Pharaoh and the Gregory Brothers! Give it up.

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123348", "text": "West Virginia, thank you!\nWhat an extraordinary turnout tonight. Thanks so much for being here.\nI want to thank all of you for being here.\nI want to thank all of you for being prepared to stand up, fight back, and make this country the nation we know it can become.\nThis campaign is not just about electing a president; it is about transforming our nation.\nIt is about having the courage to demand a political revolution.\nAnd you are the revolutionaries because you understand that unlike football or basketball, politics is not a spectator sport.\nSo let me tell you a secret that many others will not. You are all – each and every one of you – powerful people if you choose to exercise that power.\nThe fight that we are waging is not an easy fight. But I know you are prepared to wage that fight against the 1%, against the billionaire class and against a small number of people with incredible wealth and incredible power who control our economic life, our political life, and our media life.\nWhen we began this campaign just about a year ago, we started with no political organization. We started with no money and we had no name recognition outside of Vermont.\nAnd I want all of you to get up to Vermont and visit our beautiful state.\nAnd when we began this campaign, the media said \"Well, Bernie is a nice guy. He combs his hair really well. Top notch dresser. But nonetheless, he really is a fringe candidate. The campaign is a fringe campaign not to be taken seriously.\"\nAnd in the middle of all of that, we were taking on the most powerful political organization in America – an organization that elected a president – President Clinton – on two occasions and ran a very strong campaign for president for Secretary Clinton in 2008.\nAnd when we began this campaign, we were about 3% in the national polls. We were about 60 points behind Secretary Clinton. Well, a lot has happened in the last year.\nAs of today, we have now won 16 primaries and caucuses all over this country.\nAnd with your help, we're going to win here in West Virginia.\nWe have won over 1,200 delegates to the Democratic National Convention.\nAnd in the last several weeks, the national polls – they don't show us 60 points down. A few of them have us actually ahead or a few points down.\nAnd what is also extremely important, if the Democratic party is to look at which candidate is the candidate to defeat Donald Trump or any other Republican ... [applause]\nWhat we are seeing on national polls which have us 15, 20 points ahead of Donald Trump -- far more than Secretary Clinton. [applause]\nAlmost -- almost every national poll and every state poll has us defeating Trump and that margin for us is significantly larger than that of Secretary Clinton. [applause]\nAnd the reason that we are doing so much better against Republican candidates is that not only are we winning that overwhelming majority of Democratic votes but we are winning independent votes and some Republican votes as well. [applause]\nAnd that is a point that I hope the delegates to the Democratic convention fully understand. In a general election, everyone -- Democrat, independent, Republican has the right to vote for president. [applause]\nThe elections are not closed primaries. We were in New York state last week. Three million people in New York state could not vote ... [applause]\nBecause they were independents. Well, you know what? Those folks and independents all over this country will be voting in November for the next president of the United States. [applause]\nAnd in most cases we win the independent vote by a two to one margin. [applause]\nThis campaign is doing as well as it is with the extraordinary energy and enthusiasm that we are generating all across this country. Look at -- look at this room here tonight. We have over 6,000 people. [applause]\nAnd the reason that we are generating this enthusiasm is because we are doing something very unusual in contemporary American politics. We are telling the truth. [applause]\nNow, the truth is as every person here knows whether it is in our own personal lives or in our broad national political life -- truth is not always pleasant. It's not always something you are happy to hear but if we go forward as human beings -- if we go forward as a nation we cannot sweep the hard realities of our lives underneath the rug. We got to bring it out, we have to deal with it. [applause]\nAnd unfortunately -- unfortunately media in this country for a variety of reasons largely because they're owned by major corporations do not -- do not deal in most cases -- there are great exceptions. But they do not deal with the realities of our lives in a way that we need to be discussing. [applause]\nNow let me -- let me just give you a few examples of what I mean and making it really relevant to life here in West Virginia and I've been all over country. I have been all over this country and the things that I have seen are incredibly heartbreaking. I was for Flint, Michigan where children are being poisoned by lead in the water that they are drinking. [applause]\nI have been to Detroit, Michigan where their public school system is on the verge of a fiscal collapse. [applause]\nI have been to Baltimore, Maryland where tens of thousands of people are addicted to heroin. [applause]\nAnd I know -- I know that addiction is a problem here and we'll get to that in a second. But the point is -- point number one, I want everybody here to know this. Never forget it. We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world but most people in our country don't know that because almost all of the new income and wealth is going to the top one percent. [applause]\nWe are the wealthiest country in the history of the world and that means that public school systems should not be collapsing. Youth unemployment in this country should not be 30, 40 or 50 percent. Our infrastructure should not be disintegrating. [applause]\nSo we as a people have got to ask some very hard questions and then have the guts to take on some very powerful people. [applause]\nA great nation is not judged by the number of billionaires it has or the number of nuclear weapons it has. It is judged by how it treats the weakest and most vulnerable amongst us. [applause]\nIt is -- it is not acceptable to me that in America we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. That is not the way we should be treating the young people of this country. [applause]\nAnd right here in West Virginia -- your beautiful state -- 100,000 children in this great state live in poverty. Over 24 percent of the total number of kids right here in West Virginia. [applause]\nWhen we talk about employment, \"officially,\" quote unquote, unemployment in America is supposed to be five percent but you know that that is not the case. Real unemployment is much, much higher than that. [applause]\nIn fact -- in fact right here in West Virginia this state has the lowest labor force participation rate in the country. In fact, only 54 percent of the working age population in this state has a job. [applause]\nWhen we talk about the grotesque level and I talk about this a lot -- when I talk about the grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality, West Virginia is almost at the top of that list. [applause]\nAnd again -- and again this is a national problem. Believe me, it exists in my state of Vermont but this is an issue we have got to deal with in every state in this country and listen to this. From 1979 to 2012, the top one percent of the people in West Virginia saw their income go up by more than 60 percent on average while the bottom 90 percent saw their income go down ... [applause]\nGo down by four tenths of one percent and that is what we are seeing all over America. We have an economy today that is doing really, really, really great if you're in the top one percent. But if you're in the bottom 90 percent, the likelihood is you're working long hours for lower wages if you're lucky enough to have a job. [applause]\nAnd I want everybody here to know this is not just -- I'm using West Virginia statistics tonight because I'm here. This is a national issue and that is why together we are going to create an economy that works for all of our people not just the people on top. [applause]\nCouple of years ago I was chairman of a subcommittee in the Senate and we did a hearing on poverty as a death sentence. You know what I mean by that? [applause]\nThis is what I mean by that. When you hear about people being poor, people say, \"well, that's too bad. They don't have a good car, their housing is really not good. They don't have enough money to go out to eat. It's really bad being poor.\" Being poor is much, much more than that. What being poor is about in America is you die at a significantly lower age than people who have money. [applause]\nMcDowell County here in West Virginia is one of the poorest counties in the United States of America. The United States of America being the richest country in the history of the world. In McDowell County, 77 percent of the children under 18 are living in poverty in the United States of America. [applause]\nIn McDowell County, men can only expect to live until the age of 63. [applause]\nNow I want you to think about this. Again, being poor means -- it's not just you don't have the big flat screen TV or a fancy car. It means that you are dying at a significantly lower age than your fellow Americans. If you drive -- for example -- drive six miles north from this county, you go to Fairfax County, Virginia. In Fairfax County, men live on average until the age of 82 years of age -- 18 years more than men live (sic) in McDowell County.\nThe average life expectancy for a women in Fairfax County is 85. In McDowell County it is 73 years of age. [applause]\nAnd it's not just McDowell County. We have counties like that -- maybe not so bad -- all over this country. These are issues of inequality that as a nation we have got to address. [applause]\nNow, you know, one of the issues that I talk about a whole lot and it's directly related to poverty, directly related to unemployment is the fact that we have a broken criminal justice system. [applause]\nAgain, what this campaign is asking all of you is to think outside of the box -- think outside of the status quo, think beyond the options that corporate television allow you to envisage. [applause]\nThink about why people in McDowell County die at a significantly lower age than people in wealthier communities. Think about why it is that in city after city in America we have youth unemployment levels of 40, 50, 60 percent and that relates to an international embarrassment that we have more people in jail than any other country on earth. [applause]\nThis is the United States of America. We should have the best educated people in the world. [applause]\nOur people should have decent paying jobs not rot in jail. [applause]\nNow, this campaign is going to win because we are doing something unusual. We are talking to the American people and not just the wealthy campaign contributors. [applause]\nAnd when I talk about unpleasant truths that all of us have to address, truth number one is that we have a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining America democracy. [applause]\nThink outside of the box. What does democracy mean? Is it not a complicated complex. It means that you have a vote, you got a vote, you got a vote, majority wins. [applause]\nDemocracy does not mean that the Coke brothers and a few other billionaires can spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy elections. [applause]\nThat is not democracy, my friends. That is called oligarchy. [applause]\nAnd if we do not turn things around we will increasingly see an economy and a government run by a handful of billionaires and together we will not allow that to happen. [applause]\nBut is it not just -- it is not just a corrupt campaign finance system that we're going to have to address. It is a rigged economy. [applause]\nAnd this is what a rigged economy means. It means today and listen to this. This is really pretty unbelievable. The top one tenth of one percent -- not one percent -- one tenth of one percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. [applause]\nIn America today, the wealthiest 20 people own more wealth than the bottom half of America -- 150 million people. [applause]\nIn American today, one family -- the Waltons family of Walmart -- one family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people. [applause]\nAnd you know what I say? I say enough is enough. [applause]\nBut it is not only an unfair distribution of wealth. It is income as well. Again, I want to say this to the young people who may not believe me and I want you to check it -- Google it after you get out of here. Not now. [laughter]\nBut here is the fact -- 40 years ago before the explosion of technology, before the cell phones and the space age technology and before the global economy it was possible in America for one person -- one breadwinner to earn enough money to take care of the entire family. [applause]\nOne breadwinner could take -- earn enough money to take care of the entire family. Well, then you got the whole global economy, all of the technology, you know what happens. Today, mom is out working, dad is out working, the kids are out working and they have less disposable income than a one breadwinner family had 40 years ago. Something is wrong with our economy. [applause]\nIn America today, in Vermont, West Virginia, you got people working not one job. They're working two jobs, they're working three jobs. You got people working longer hours for lower wages. We are going to create an economy that protects the needs of our workers, our children, our seniors, our veterans. All of the people of this country and not just the one percent. [applause]\nNow, what does that mean? Is that a hard thing to do? No, it's not. Let me give you an example of some of what we have got to do. Number one, in America if you work 40 hours a week you should not be living in poverty. We're going to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. [applause]\nFifteen bucks an hour will mean that millions of people will be able to support their families with the kind of dignity and security that they do not have today. [applause]\nAnd second when we talk about equitable wages we're going to end the absurdity of women making $0.79 on the dollar compared to men ... [applause]\nAnd I know that every man here will join the women in the fight for pay equity. [applause]\nWhen unemployment rates throughout this country are extremely high especially in urban areas and in rural areas and when people are not making enough income to take care of their family, it is a no brainer to suggest we need a massive federal jobs program to put our people back to work. [applause]\nIn Vermont and in West Virginia and all over this country our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, our rail system, our airports, our levees and dams are in massive disrepair. We can create 13 million jobs with a trillion dollar investment. [applause]\nWell, people say, \"yeah. That's a nice idea. Yeah. Our infrastructure is crumbling. You're right, Bernie but how you going to pay for it?\" I will tell you how we're going to pay for it. Right now we have a corrupt federal tax system which allows major corporations -- major corporations who make billions of dollars a year in profit to stash their profits in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and in other tax havens. [applause]\nWe're going to end -- we are going to end that tax loophole. A hundred billion a year we invest in the infrastructure, we create the jobs that we need ... [applause]\nAnd when we talk about the economy, we've got to talk about something that media almost never talks about. It's not a sexy -- not a sexy issue but an enormously important issue and that is our disastrous trade policies. [applause]\nAgain, let me tell the young people something they may not know and that is there was actually once a time not so many years ago when you could go to a department store and buy products manufactured in the United States of America. [applause]\nBut as a result of trade policies like NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China, policies written by corporate America -- what happened is companies shut down plants in Vermont, West Virginia and all over this country. They said, \"why do I want to pay somebody here $15, $20 an hour when I can go to China, Mexico, pay people pennies an hour,\" and that's what they did. [applause]\nAs a result of these terrible trade agreements we have lost millions of decent paying jobs. Millions and one of the big differences between Secretary Clinton and myself -- she supported virtually every one of these disastrous trade agreements. I have opposed them all. [applause]\nAnd our message to corporate America is you want us to buy the products you make, make these damn products here in West Virginia and in America. [applause]\nThis campaign is going to win because we are listening to people whose voices are not often heard. And one of the groups of people that I have been very proud to listen to all over this country is young people. [applause]\nIt's a funny thing. When we began this campaign, the general attitude of the punditry and the political scientists were, \"well, young people, they're not really interested in government. They're not interested in politics. They're too busy with their video games or whatever else they do.\" Well, it turns out that the young people of this country are a lot smarter than many of the pundits thought. [applause]\nIf it turns out -- turns out that the young people understand. They are the future of this country and they want to help shape that future. [applause]\nAnd young people understand that there is something profoundly wrong when in this country today the young generation may be the first generation in the modern history of America to have a lower standard of living than their parents. [applause]\nThat's right. My father came to this country at the age of 17 with money. He never made any money but we work hard and my mom worked hard and their dream was that their kids -- my brother and I would be financially better off than they were. That is called the American dream that millions of American families have experienced. Parents work hard so their kids can do better than they. [applause]\nAnd together -- together that American dream -- that American dream -- we will not allow to die. [applause]\nThere's another issue out there that young people all over the country talk to me about. And they say, \"Bernie, we did what our parents told us to do, what our teachers told us to do, what our community told us to do and that is go out and get the best education that we can.\" Because we all understand that learning and education is inherent in who we are as human beings and that also for our country to do well in the future we need the best educated work force in the world. [applause]\nSo millions -- millions of young people did the right thing. They went to college but then what happened is they left school 30, 50, $70,000 in debt. [applause]\nAnd I have talked to people who are paying off that debt for decades. [applause]\nThey can't afford to buy a car, buy a house, get married, have kids because they're paying off that debt. For what crime did they commit? For getting an education. That is nuts. [applause]\nAll of you know that 40 or 50 years ago if you had a high school degree the likelihood was that you were able to go out and get a halfway decent job and make it into the middle class with a high school degree. But the world has changed, the economy has changed, technology has changed, people today need more education than they did 50 years ago. [applause]\nAnd thinking outside of the box, outside of the status quo leads you to a very simple conclusion. Fifty years ago it was great that we had free public education from first grade to 12th grade. That was great. But the world has changed and when we talk about public education today it must mean making public colleges and universities tuition free. [applause]\nNow think for a moment there are people who have attacked me on this. Oh, saying it's a radical idea, Bernie. This is not a radical idea. It exists in countries like Germany already and Scandinavia. They understand that investing in their young people is investing in the future of their country. [applause]\nAnd by the way, you may not know this but 50 years ago in the United States of America our major great public colleges and universities were virtually tuition free. If we could have virtually free tuition 50 years ago, we damn well can do it today. [applause]\nNow, once again -- once again this proposal which by the way also includes dealing with the crisis of student debt today because we have millions of people dealing with student debt and our proposal will allow people with student debt to refinance their loans at the lowest interest rates they can find. [applause]\nJust out of curiosity, how many people here are carrying student debt right now. [applause]\nOK. All right. We are going to lower than student debt. [applause]\nNow, my critics say, \"hey, Bernie. You're a nice guy. You're giving out free tuition, you're going to lower student debt. Where you going to get the money?\" OK. And here is the point. I want you to think again outside of the box. This is not the dynamic that the media provides but you got to think through this stuff and you can. Eight, nine years ago as a result of the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street the Congress bailed out the big banks. [applause]\nApparently -- apparently there was plenty of money available to bail out large banks who were too big to fail. Now I believe that right now when Wall Street is doing quite well thank you that we should impose a tax on Wall Street speculation. [applause]\nAnd that tax alone -- that one tax alone will bring in more than enough money to substantially lower student debt and make public colleges tuition free in this country. [applause]\nNow, Wall Street may not like it but you know what? I could care less what Wall Street likes. [applause]\nAnd by the way when we make public colleges and universities tuition free we do something that is really revolutionary. I want you to think about this for a second. Right now in my state and right here in West Virginia you got a lot of kids who grew up, are growing up poor whose parents never went to college and these kids never in a million years can imagine that they will go to college.\nBut if we can make it clear to the parents and the teachers and the children that any kid in this country who studies hard, who does his or her school work well -- those kids will be able to get a higher education. [applause]\nThat is revolutionary. Now I want to touch on an issue that I know is controversial here in West Virginia but it's an issue I deal with all over the country and I am not going to tell you anything different than I say in Vermont or California. [applause]\nAnd that is -- that is that as a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on the environment I have talked to scientists all over this country and all over the world. And what the scientists tell us almost unanimously is that climate change is real. [applause]\nClimate change is caused by human activity. [applause]\nAnd climate change is already causing devastating problems in our country and around the world. [applause]\nAnd here's what the scientists also tell and this is scary stuff. What they say is if we do not get our act together and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel then what we will be seeing in years to come is more drought, more flooding, more extreme weather disturbances, more acidification of the ocean, more rising sea levels and more international conflict as people fight over limited natural resources. [applause]\nAnd it seems to me that to address this issue we have got to do two things. Number one, we have a moral obligation to our kids and future generations to make certain that we leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable. [applause]\nBut second of all, we have a moral obligation to protect those workers in the fossil fuel industry. [applause]\nWe cannot leave those people in the coal industry, in the oil industry, in the gas industry high and dry. We cannot go that and that is why ... [applause]\nThat is why we have a moral obligation to make certain that those people who may lose their jobs get new jobs. [applause]\nAnd get the education and all of the benefits that they deserve. [applause]\nWhen we think outside of the box we have to ask ourselves some simple questions. How does it happen that every major country on earth guarantees health care to all of their people except the United States? [applause]\nI'm a member of the committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act. They Affordable Care Act has done a lot of good things but -- but today 29 million people have no health insurance still. Many of you are underinsured with high co-payments and high deductibles and the drug companies rip us all off by charging us the highest price [inaudible] ... [applause]\nAnd that is why I believe we need to move toward a Medicare for all single payer [inaudible] ... [applause]\nThink -- think about an America where every person as a right has health care. What that means is you will not have to stay on your job if you don't like that job just because you got health care on that job. [applause]\nThink about going to the doctor when you're sick not having to worry about a co-payment or a deductible. [applause]\nAnd think about a Medicare for all program saving the average family thousands of dollars a year on their health insurance. [applause]\nAnd when we talk about health care let me deal very briefly with an issue that is on the minds of all of you in West Virginia and in my state of Vermont. There is no debate but that we have a tragic crisis in America today with opiate and heroin addiction. [applause]\nAnd I know -- I know that it is a serious crisis here but trust me it is a serious crisis in my state as well. And the issue of how we deal with it seems to me to reach the conclusion that we have got to deal with substance abuse and addiction as a health issue, not a criminal issue. [applause]\nWhat does that mean? What it means and again think outside of the box. What it means is that we have got to revolutionize mental health treatment in America. [applause]\nWe have got to provide treatment to people when they need it not six months from now. [applause]\nAnd on another issue relating to drugs, one of the problems with our criminal justice system is that over the last 30 years millions of people have received criminal records because of possession of marijuana. [applause]\nAnd if you have a criminal record you know what? And you're a kid it is hard to go out and get a job. We have got to rethink the so-called war on drugs. [applause]\nRight now -- right now under the federal controlled substance act -- federal controlled substance act marijuana is listed as a schedule I drug next to heroin. [applause]\nNow, scientists argue -- scientists argue the pluses and minuses of marijuana but marijuana is not heroin which is a killer drug. [applause]\nAnd that is why I have legislation in that will take marijuana out of the federal controlled substance act. [applause]\nLegalizing -- legalizing marijuana is a state issue. It should not be a federal crime. [applause]\nEverybody here knows a profound lesson of American history and that is that real change never takes place from the top on down. It always takes place from the bottom up. [applause]\nA hundred years ago when workers in West Virginia and all over this country were forced to work seven days a week, 12 hours a day, when kids were working in the mines and in the factories, working people came together to form trade unions so they could have some dignity on the job. [applause]\nAnd that's what happens when people come together. A hundred years ago in this country and the kids don't know this -- women did not have the right to vote, did not have the right to get the education or the jobs they wanted less than a hundred years ago. [applause]\nBut what happened? Women stood up. [applause]\nWomen fought back and with their male allies they said, \"you know what? In America, women will not be second class citizens.\" [applause]\nHundreds of years ago amidst the abomination of slavery African Americans and their allies had a different vision for America. Some of them went to jail, some of them died, some of them were beaten but they said that in America we will end racism, segregation and [inaudible] ... [applause]\nIf we were here in this room 10 years ago which is no time at all from a historical perspective and somebody jumps up and says, \"you know, Bernie, I think that by the year 2015 gay marriage will be legal in 50 states of this country...\" [applause]\nThe person next to him would have said, \"you're crazy. Not going to happen. Not going to happen.\" But because the gay community and their straight allies were prepared to take on bigotry and hatred we've succeeded in making gay marriage legal. [applause]\nIf we were here five years ago -- five years ago, somebody jumps up and says, \"Bernie, a $7.25 federal minimum wage is a starvation wage. We have to raise that wage to $15 an hour.\" The person next to her would have said, \"$15 an hour? You want to more than double the minimum wage? You're nuts. You're thinking too big. It can't happen. Maybe $8, maybe nine -- 15 -- too high.\" But you know what happened? Workers in the fast food industry in MacDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's went out on strike. [applause]\nThey stood up and they fought back and then two years ago in Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, $15 an hour minimum wage. [applause]\nIn Oregon, in California, New York State, $15 an hour minimum wage. [applause]\nWhat is my point? My point is that ideas today that seem so radical -- raising the minimum wage, making public colleges and universities tuition free, providing health care for all people as a right, having paid family and medical leave ... [applause]\nEnding a corrupt campaign finance system ... [applause]\nAddressing the crisis of climate change, making sure that women are paid equal pay for equal work ... [applause]\nMaking sure our kids have jobs not jail cells ... [applause]\nAll of these ideas today they seem radical but they are not radical. They are ideas that in fact are supported by the vast majority of the American people. [applause]\nBut they are not supported by the billionaire class, by Wall Street and corporate America. [applause]\nSo what this campaign is about is asking millions of people throughout this country -- working people, middle class people, young people, old people, gay people, straight people, black, white, Latino, Asian-American, Native American ... [applause]\nMaking certain that the Donald Trumps of the world do not divide us up. [applause]\nUnderstanding that when we stand together there is nothing -- nothing that we cannot accomplish. [applause]\nNow, on May 10th there is going to be a very important primary here in West Virginia. [applause]\nAnd what we have learned in this campaign is when there are large voter turnouts we win. When they are low voter turnouts we lose. [applause]\nAll right. That's what I want to hear. [applause]\nI hope -- I hope that on May 10th, West Virginia will have the largest voter turnout in the history of the state. [applause]\nAnd I hope very much that West Virginia will join the political revolution. Thank you all very much.

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123350", "text": "BRZEZINSKI: That was Hillary Clinton at last night's MSNBC town hall, speaking about how in 2008 she worked hard to convince her supporters to support then Senator Barack Obama.\nJoining us from Philadelphia, Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\nGood morning. Welcome back to the show. I guess we'll start right there, Senator, because a lot of people, especially in the Clinton campaign say that you're hurting the party and you're hurting her chances of going into the nomination.\nSANDERS: I'm hurting the party?\nBRZEZINSKI: Well?\nSANDERS: Mika there was just a study that came out from Harvard yesterday which suggests that the Sanders campaign is turning around millions of young people, getting them to be more progressive, in fact, getting them into the Democratic Party.\nSo I don't think we're hurting the party. I think a vigorous debate on the important issues facing the American people is not only exactly what democracy is supposed to be about, at the end of the day, it creates more political interest, it drives up voter turn out, and when voter turn out is high, progressives and Democrats win elections.\nSo, let me be very clear...\nBRZEZINSKI: You can't argue -- you...\nSANDERS: Let -- go ahead, I'm sorry.\nBRZEZINSKI: No, it's all right. You can't argue, though, that you're -- I mean, if she is close to clenching this, if there is no path for you, then you're just hurting her as -- on the road to the nomination and she goes into it more damaged, maybe some would argue.\nSANDERS: Well, first of all -- first of all, I don't accept there is no path for us. You know, let's not count our chickens before they're hatched.\nThere are five contests today. The state of California. Last I heard, the largest state in the United States of America has not yet cast a ballot.\nI think all of the people of this country have a right to participate to determine who the Democratic nominee will be and what the agenda will be. And I think it will be very healthy for democracy and the Democratic Party when we have the debate, the platform debates, the policy debates at the convention.\nShould the United States of America join every other major country and guarantee health care to all people through a Medicare for all program? Should we provide paid family and medical leave? Should we address the grotesque level of income inequality?\nShould we deal with the fact that we have more people in jail than any other country? A lot of good debates to take place.\nSCARBOROUGH: So...\nSANDERS: And if I do not win the nomination, trust me, I'll do everything I can to make sure that some Republican does not end up in the White House.\nSCARBOROUGH: But how important is it to you, win or lose, to reshape the Democratic Party as you move forward through the convention and make sure it's not the Democratic Party of Hillary Clinton's past, which we saw the New York times magazine this weekend painted her vividly as a hawk, as an interventionist.\nAnd as you have said...\nSANDERS: That is...\nSCARBOROUGH: ... as somebody who has closer ties to Wall Street than probably the two Republican candidates?\nSANDERS: Look, Joe, I'm really very proud that our campaign has brought so much energy into the political process. Not just young people, but working people, and the issue you raise is a very important issue.\nLook, we know that sometimes our military has got to be involved in a war. But I think there are a lot of Democrats out there who are concerned that secretary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq, was active in the overthrow of the Gadhafi government in Libya, and maybe a little bit too much...\nSCARBOROUGH: Is Hillary Clinton a hawk? Because we were talking to a New York Times reporter yesterday, and having a hard time getting her to admit what her own paper wrote over the weekend.\nDo you believe that Hillary Clinton is a war hawk?\nSANDERS: Let me just say this, my views on foreign policy are different than Secretary Clinton's. I helped lead the opposition to the war in Iraq. I think that force, military force is the last resort not the first resort. And I think my views are a lot closer to President Obama's than they are to Hillary Clinton's.\nSCARBOROUGH: But do you think she's a hawk?\nBRZEZINSKI: Or hawkish.\nSCARBOROUGH: Is she -- is she -- is she an interventionist?\nSANDERS: I don't want to -- you know, I don't want to -- Joe, I don't want to characterize it.\nSCARBOROUGH: But not -- what about an interventionist? It really matters to people in the Democratic Party.\nSANDERS: It does matter.\nSCARBOROUGH: Especially after eight years of Bush and Cheney, and then the tripling of troops in Afghanistan and all the things that Hillary Clinton proposed while she was secretary of state.\nIt does matter to a lot of Democrats on whether they're going to nominate someone who is an interventionist. Do you believe she's an interventionist?\nSANDERS: No, that's right. I think -- look, again, I don't want to characterize her, but I think our views on foreign policy are different.\nI think what we have got to understand is that there are terrible dictators all over the world, but regime change, overthrowing some dictator often has unintended consequences.\nLet's go way, way back to Guatemala, to Iran, when we overthrew a Democratically elected prime minister there.\nSo, I am more cautious about that. And in terms, certainly, the Middle East right now with ISIS, I believe it must be Muslim troops on the ground who do the fighting with the support of the United States. I will do everything that I can to prevent our troops from getting involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.\nSo, I think if the question is, do Secretary Clinton and I look at foreign policy in a different way? The answer is yes, we do.\nBARNICLE: Senator, the Harvard study that you just referenced a few moments ago, showed your tremendous popularity among millennials. You've brought many millennials into the political process.\nBut it also points out that a majority of millennials -- I'm having trouble pronouncing the word -- reject both socialism and capitalism. They don't believe in socialism, they don't believe in capitalism. What should they believe in?\nSANDERS: I think they should believe, Mike, in economic justice and ending this really, really grotesque level of incumbent wealth inequity in America, where the 20 wealthiest people now own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans.\nI've been in cities from all over this country, from Flint, to Detroit, to Philadelphia where you have 40, 50 percent of the children in those cities living in poverty. So, I think that the fight for economic justice -- and I'll tell you what else is resonating with young people.\nThey understand what corporate media, by the way, does not understand. That climate change is the great environmental crisis of our time, and that we have got to take on the fossil fuel industry, transform our energy system away from coal and oil into energy efficiency and sustainable energy. That generation understands that.\nAnd the other thing they understand is that the younger generation today, if we do not change the economy, will, for the first time in modern history, have a lower standard of living than their parents. In other words, we're seeing the death of the American dream. These young people don't want to see that dream die.\nSo, there are a lot of issues out there that these young people, I think, are standing up and fighting for.\nSCARBOROUGH: Yeah.\nSANDERS: But I do believe they think government should play a more important role in protecting needs of the working people, the elderly, the children, the poor than we're seeing now.\nGEIST: Senator Sanders, it's Willie Geist. Good to see you this morning.\nYou said something at our town hall last night I thought was interesting.\nSANDERS: Hey, Willie.\nGEIST: You said, if she becomes the nominee, it's not incumbent on you to tell your voters to go vote for her, it's incumbent on her to convince your voters that they should vote for her.\nSo, many of your supporters are adamantly against Hillary Clinton, adamantly for you. What could she say to a Bernie Sanders voter, theoretically, if she does get the nomination, to convince them that they ought to leave you and go vote for her?\nSANDERS: I think what she has to do -- what any candidate has to do to win a general election is to convince the vast majority of the people who are the working class of this country, the middle class, lower income people that she is, more than any candidate is on their side.\nYou don't have to convince the billionaires. You know, they have enormous power -- all that many of them. You have got to convince ordinary people that you're prepared to deal with the major crises facing this country.\nWhat are those crises? We're looking at a disappearing middle class in this country. We're looking at corporations who, in a given year, may make billions of dollars in profits and not pay a nickel in taxes. We're looking at kids graduating college $50, $70,000 in debt, paying it off that debt for decades.\nThe American people understand that in this great country, the rich and the billionaire class in corporate America cannot have it all.\nSo, I think that for Hillary Clinton, or Bernie Sanders or any other nominee, they got to go out to the American people, say yeah, I do have the guts to take on Wall Street, to end the disastrous trade policy, to take on corporate America, to say, yes, that the wealthy and powerful will start paying their fair share of taxes.\nGEIST: And you said, though, Senator, she has not been capable of doing that thus far, that she is in the pocket of Wall Street.\nSo, how could she change her tone and convince your voters to go to her?\nSANDERS: Well, I -- well, you know, that is her job. You know, people think, you know, Bernie Sanders is going to snap his fingers and everybody who votes for him is, oh, now we're going to, you know, vote for Hillary Clinton. Bernie said so. That's not the way the real world works. And it should not work that way. I have got to -- if I win the nomination, I'm going to have to convince Hillary Clinton supporters and Republicans and independents to vote for me. Hillary Clinton, every other candidate has the same challenge.\nAnd I happen to believe, as I just said, that the American people are tired of establishment politics. They understand that almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. They understand that there's something profoundly wrong when we're the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all of our people, or paid family and medical leave. They are tired of seeing in cities all over this country so many of our children going to totally inadequate schools and living in poverty. And I think we need leadership in this country to address those issues to understand that we have to take on the billionaire class. That's how you win elections, in my view.\nSCARBOROUGH: Senator, good morning. It's Mark Halperin. Every president and vice president we've had in this country has been a man. If you are the nominee, would you commit to picking a woman as your running mate?\nSANDERS: Well, I'm not going to commit -- you know, you have to look at the best candidates you can. But I think your point is well taken. I think the women of this country, the people of this country, understand that it would be a great idea to have a woman as vice president and something I would give very, very serious thought to.\nBRZEZINSKI: All right.\nSCARBOROUGH: Are there any women in particular you think would be qualified for that job?\nSANDERS: Are there any women? Yes, there are many women who would be qualified for that job.\nSCARBOROUGH: Could you name a couple?\nSANDERS: No. I think it's a little bit early to be speculating on that. But I think -- you know, as you know, there are people in life that -- Elizabeth Warren, I think, has been a real champion in standing up for working families, taking on Wall Street. There are other -- you know, fantastic women who have been active in all kinds of fights who I think would make great vice presidential candidates.\nSCARBOROUGH: All right.\nBRZEZINSKI: All right. Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you very much.\nSCARBOROUGH: Thank you, Bernie. We always love having you on.\nBRZEZINSKI: And tomorrow on \"Morning Joe\"...\nSANDERS: Thank you very much.\nBRZEZINSKI: Good luck tonight.", "timestamp": "2016-04-26", "title": "Interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\""}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117336", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:08 P.M. EDT\nQ: You didn't wait and finish watching Trump --\nMR. EARNEST: No. I didn't start, either. (Laughter.) I'll catch the highlights later on tonight.\nQ: He said \"Tan-zania.\"\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, apparently the phonetics are not included on the teleprompter. (Laughter.)\nAll right, on to more serious topics. Kevin, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Josh, can you talk a bit about the President's trip to Flint, Michigan? Why now? What does he hope to accomplish? And is it designed to put more pressure on Congress to do more to help that area?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, you saw that the President had written a letter in response to a young girl in Flint who had asked the President to spend some time meeting with the residents of Flint to show and remind them that the American people continue to keep that community in mind as they deal with some pretty significant challenges.\nThe President is prepared to travel there next month -- next week, and demonstrate that while the public discussion of this situation doesn't retain the same spot in the limelight, the administration is committed to following through on helping that community recover.\nNow, we certainly would welcome a greater commitment -- or, frankly, any commitment -- from Republicans in Congress to responding to this situation. The administration has marshalled significant resources to help that community respond. There was the urgent provision of bottled water and filters by FEMA in the immediate aftermath of the situation. But over the longer term, there's been a commitment by the administration to expanding Medicaid to ensure that more citizens across Flint can get access to needed health care. There have been grants provided to local health care providers to expand their capacity to provide immediate needed health care. The EPA has ramped up their monitoring of the water supply, and this expanded testing can verify that the appropriate steps are being taken to restore safe drinking water to Flint.\nSo there are a number of things that the administration has done, but there are significant underlying problems that can only be addressed through congressional action. And I also think that the President will note that the administration is committed to responding to the situation both to help the people of Flint recover but also to make sure that a similar situation is not being experienced in communities all across the country.\nAnd you've seen the EPA, months ago -- or at least more than a month ago -- write a letter to governors across the country, outlining exactly how the lead and copper rule will be enforced to ensure that a situation like this isn't repeated. And that certainly stands in stark contrast to some Republicans in Congress who advocate for the eliminating of the EPA. How exactly is that going to improve the situation? This is the agency that is principally responsible for protecting our clean air and clean water.\nSo as you can tell from my answer to your question, there's a lot to talk about in Flint, and the President is looking forward to taking advantage of this opportunity to ensure that the people of Flint understand that we're going to follow through on our response and to make sure they understand that the American people haven't forgotten.\nQ: Is the administration confident that EPA leaders have been held fully accountable for what occurred there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, there's more than one ongoing investigation. And so when it comes to accountability, I've refrained from weighing in in a lot of detail because I don't want to be perceived as even attempting to influence those ongoing investigations in one form or another. So we'll let those move forward. But the President certainly believes in accountability. And as the President of the United States, the President takes responsibility for a lot of things.\nQ: And now that we have a clearer picture of this year's presidential race, does President Obama consider Hillary Clinton to be the presumptive nominee? Does he have any near-term plans for rallying Democrats around her candidacy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the Democratic voters will determine who the Democratic nominee is going to be, and Republican voters will determine who the Republican nominee is going to be. And that's the way that our process was structured, and the President participated in that process by casting a vote of his own in the Illinois primary.\nBut, ultimately, the voters will decide and the candidates will make their own individual decisions about how long to pursue the nomination. And that's a perfectly appropriate decision for them to make on their own. I don't have any details to announce at this point about when the President will be engaged in this debate, but he most assuredly will once the general election has begun.\nQ: Josh, just one final one. How serious is the threat of the legislation from Senator Cotton to prevent the U.S. from purchasing heavy-water from Iran? Is the White House prepared to veto that legislation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I learned shortly before coming out here that this legislation did not succeed in getting the sufficient number of votes in the Senate to end debate. So that is an indication that there is not likely to be the necessary support in the United States Senate to add that amendment to this broader appropriations bill.\nBut we've made clear our commitment to a principle that ideologically motivated policy riders are not appropriate for appropriations bills. And that is the -- you all have written extensively about Senator Cotton's repeated commitment to undermining the successful implementation of the international agreement among Iran and some of our closest allies to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. So it is clear what the intent of his amendment is. Senator Cotton is certainly no expert when it comes to heavy-water. I'm confident that he couldn't differentiate heavy-water from sparkling water. His focus is on undermining the effective implementation of this agreement that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nSo we'll have to see if -- but right now, I guess I'd say that we're gratified that this has not advanced in the Senate.\nTim.\nQ: Hi. Back to Flint. Given that the federal EPA -- there were problems there, there were failures there -- and you mentioned some of the FEMA money, but Congress is not being able to get money through. So can we expect some other way to get federal money to the people in Flint?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I didn't hear the entirety of the first part of your question. What did you say about the EPA?\nQ: Just the failures there, that the EPA was at fault for not telling -- there was a scientist there who knew about the poisoning, but within the EPA the message didn't get out and was delayed there.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there continues to be an investigation into the EPA's response to the situation. So, again, I'm going to reserve judgment on that.\nBut there have been some conclusions that have been reached about the conduct at the state agency that was responsible for protecting the water supply in Flint. And there are at least three individuals who have been indicted for their conduct by the Michigan Attorney General. And I'd also point out that it was the independent commission that was established by Governor Snyder who pointed out that \"the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality failed in its fundamental responsibility to effectively enforce drinking water regulations.\" So, again, I think when it comes to accountability, the agencies that have looked at this thus far and reported some results have raised significant concerns about what was happening at the state level.\nThere continues to be an investigation of the entire response and the potential role of the federal regulators. And, again, I'm certainly not going to say anything that's going to try to -- that could be perceived as influencing the outcome of those investigations. But the investigations that have been completed thus far have focused most of their attention, if not all, on the conduct of state officials.\nMore generally, the reason that Congress has not acted on funding for Flint is because Republicans say they oppose it. So it's not just congressional dysfunction that has prevented the appropriation of this money, but rather because Republicans oppose providing it. And that's despite the conscientious work of people like Senator Stabenow and Senator Peters, in particular, but other Democrats who have said that Congress has a role and a responsibility for making sure that the state of Michigan and the city of Flint has available resources.\nWhen it comes to the administration, our options are a little bit more limited. But you saw that earlier this year the administration expedited some grant funding that was relevant to water infrastructure projects to try to provide additional resources to the state of Michigan that could be used in Flint to address this situation. We'll continue to look for other ways that we can offer up assistance, both as it relates to infrastructure but also as it relates to health care and other emergency funding. But there's a role for Congress to play, and right now it's Republicans who are preventing those necessary steps from occurring.\nQ: And when can we expect the EPA to change the lead and copper rule?\nMR. EARNEST: You'd have to talk to them about whether or not that's something they're considering. The concern that has been expressed is that there was a little bit of ambiguity about the most effective way to enforce that rule, and that's precisely why you saw the administrator of the EPA write a letter to governors all across the country making clear exactly how the EPA was prepared to enforce that rule. And she did that because she's focused on making sure that what happened in Flint doesn't crop up in a whole bunch of communities across the country. And I think this is prudent and effective leadership of learning from shortcomings, and making sure they aren't replicated in other situations. That's responsible leadership and it's certainly something that the EPA Administrator, Gina McCarthy, takes quite seriously.\nQ: And on Puerto Rico, there's a payment due on Sunday and then one in July. But it looks like the bill -- rescue package -- whatever you want to call it -- is being delayed. Is there anything the White House can do to speed that along?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, I'm not sure what it would be. We rolled out a proposal 188 or 189 days ago, and we haven't seen much activity from the Republicans who are in charge of the House of Representatives. We did see a commitment from the Republican leadership in the House to move on a legislative package for Puerto Rico in the first quarter of this year, and we haven't seen nearly as much movement as we would like.\nI think among some Republican leaders there has been a genuine effort that's been made, but among many other Republicans there has just been a refusal to embrace their responsibility to govern. I think you can detect what I expect will be a bit of an emerging pattern over the course of this briefing that we're going to spend a lot of time talking about how Republicans in Congress aren't doing their job, and that when it comes to core priorities, you've got an administration that is putting forward ideas, that is offering up specific proposals, making specific recommendations, and doing everything within our power to try to address problems.\nBut you have a Republican majority in both the House and the Senate that seems much more committed to playing political games and engaging in political obstruction than actually using the majority that they fought so hard to win to strengthen the country. And that's unfortunate.\nQ: How concerned is the White House that, even if Republicans come to a deal, that there's going to be items attached, like the minimum wage, that the Democrats have --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that certainly would be consistent with what I just said. Attempting to add completely unrelated ideological riders to a piece of legislation that would give the government of Puerto Rico the restructuring authority that they need to try to prevent an economic and humanitarian disaster on an island that's inhabited by 3 million Americans is a failure of leadership on the part of Republicans. And I don't know exactly what they're going to do, but what I do know is that the longer that we go with Republicans blocking responsible legislation that is not a bailout, but does give the Puerto Rican government the opportunity to restructure their debts in a way that would allow them to implement some economic and fiscal reforms, means that we're only getting closer to a bailout actually being required.\nSo that's why we continue to make a strong case that Republican obstruction of this critical legislation only makes a bailout more likely. But hopefully that's something that we can avoid.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, is the little girl from Flint who wrote the President coming to the White House this week?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the answer to that. I don't believe that she is.\nQ: She asked if she could come by.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, and I believe in the President's response he noted that he was looking forward to traveling to Flint and having an opportunity to meet with her there.\nQ: How does a letter like that get in front of the President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as you know, Mark, there's a process where the White House Correspondence Office will consider the thousands of pieces of correspondence that's received by the White House, either through the postal service or via e-mail, and they process that material and they choose about 10 letters each day that are a representative sample of the letters that have been received by the White House that day, and they put them in front of the President.\nQ: So that was one of the 10-a-day?\nMR. EARNEST: That's often how this process works. Occasionally, if the President shows interest in a particular area, they may seek out additional pieces of correspondence that they can show the President. I do not know whether this young lady's letter was one of the 10, but I do know that the President has reviewed several pieces of correspondence that are directly related to the situation in Flint. And I just don't know whether or not her letter was included in the Flint-related correspondence that was presented to the President, or if her letter was part of the 10 letters a day that the President reviews on a variety of topics.\nQ: On politics, Donald Trump said again today that he believes President Obama was snubbed because President Castro was not at the airport to greet him when he arrived in Havana. Did the White House see that as a snub or arriving anywhere and the head of state is not there to greet the President?\nMR. EARNEST: No. And, Mark, as you know, it is not at all uncommon for the President to have formal meetings with heads of state when he travels not to participate in ceremonial arrival ceremonies with heads of state when he arrives at the airport. And so those of you who traveled with the President to Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Germany may have observed that neither the leader of Saudi Arabia, nor the United Kingdom, nor Germany met the President at the airport. So it rather is -- so it is most common for the President to be received by a lower level official at the airport so that the senior level official, the head of the government or the head of -- the most senior official in the country can meet with the President more formally.\nQ: And lastly, is President Obama planning on addressing the Democratic Convention in July?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't believe that's something that we've announced at this point.\nQ: That's why I'm asking. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I certainly would expect that the President would do so. I do not know at this point whether or not a date has been selected. Presumably, that's something that we would coordinate with the Democratic nominee, once one has been chosen. So we'll keep you posted on that, though.\nMary.\nQ: On the ongoing fight over Zika funding, Republicans continue to insist that there's enough remaining money in the pipeline to address this. And the Speaker actually went a step further by saying -- or rather accusing the administration of having, as he put it, a bit of a track record of over-requesting what is needed. Just wonder if you're confident that the amount that's being requested will be --\nMR. EARNEST: That's interesting. The Republican Congress certainly has a well-established track record of under-performing in response to those requests. This is the latest example of that.\nSometimes that can be attributed to just a difference of opinion about what's needed. That's not a plausible explanation in this case. You have the Director of the National Institute of Health and a high-ranking official from the Centers for Disease Control standing at this podium about three weeks ago and say they did not have the resources that they needed that should be used to fully prepare for the onset of the Zika virus. So these are experts. These are not political appointees of the President of the United States. These are legitimate scientific experts who are responsible for protecting the health and safety of the American people. And they said that Congress had not provided them with all of the resources that they believe are necessary to do everything possible to prepare the country for the Zika virus.\nThis is notable primarily because when we initially put forward our request, Speaker Ryan indicated that there is \"plenty of money in the pipeline right now that can go to Zika.\" Then just a couple of weeks ago, he said that funding for Zika should go through the normal process. Presumably, he said that before the process completely broke down in the House of Representatives that he leads.\nAnd now he's saying that somehow they don't have enough information to evaluate our request. He says that despite the fact that discussions of the Zika virus have emerged in 48 different congressional hearings. There was a briefing that was offered to every member of Congress in both the House and the Senate so that they could hear directly from our nation's top scientists, so they could understand exactly what the threat is.\nThere have been ample opportunities for members of Congress who have questions to ask them. There have been a variety of answers that have been given. The administration put forward a specific proposal, dated February 22nd, with lots of details about what exactly these resources would do to make the country safer and to allow us to prepare for the Zika virus.\nWhat's interesting about this situation is, as I mentioned yesterday, we often can't predict exactly where a flood is going to hit; we don't know the exact path of a tornado. These are emergencies that we cannot specifically prepare for; we can in general. We know which regions of the country are more likely to be flooded or more likely to be hit by a tornado. In this situation, we do have an opportunity. We have months that could have been used to prepare for the onset of this virus. And yet, that time has been frittered away by Republicans who have refused to do what is necessary to protect the country from a genuine public health emergency.\nQ: Beyond the $600,000 million in remaining Ebola funding that's already been allocated, it seems there's several hundreds of millions left, still remaining in Ebola funding. As the stalemate continues, is that an area where you may be looking to free up some remaining funding, or not?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that certainly would not be our preference. Look, when we were in the midst of what was then described by many people publicly as an Ebola crisis, there were legitimate questions asked by all of you in this room of me while I was standing here why we hadn't done more to prepare for the situation. And we eventually were able to secure necessary resources from Congress to begin to take the appropriate steps to ensure that our public health system and, frankly, the public health system in other countries where the Ebola virus is most likely to emerge, were oriented to try to protect us from the Ebola virus.\nWhy we would now go and undermine those investments and dedicate them to something else only because Congress wouldn't act is not a wise decision. The wise decision is to take the investments that we've already made in protecting the country from Ebola, making sure they continue to be effectively spent, and also using the resources of this country to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\nThis is not that complicated. This should be a pretty straightforward policy decision. But unfortunately, as I've mentioned, Republicans, who spent years in the minority throwing sand in the gears of government, have kept throwing the sand in the gears, despite the fact they are now in charge of the government when it comes to the House of Representatives and the United States Senate. That raises questions, frankly, why they chose to run in the first place.\nQ: And one question on the campaign. It was around this time in 2008 when Senator Feinstein brokered a meeting between then Senator Obama and Hillary Clinton to try and bring the two together and unite the party. Does the President at all feel obligated to try and foster a similar meeting between Senators Clinton and Sanders, and does he think that such a meeting would benefit the candidates and the party at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any discussions about a brokered meeting, at least, that involve the White House. Look, as you've heard me say on many occasions, there were predictions in 2008 that the longer than expected Democratic primary was going to have a negative impact on the eventual nominee. That didn't prove to be true. In some states that had not recently been the host of a competitive primary, it gave Democrats in those states the opportunity to build an infrastructure. And it certainly created opportunities for Democrats in 2008 to win in states that Democrats hadn't won in a while. Indiana is a good example of that.\nSo that's why I think you'll find a lot of people, at least in this administration, who still have vivid memories of the 2008 race, that we understand that these kinds of contests can sometimes go on longer than expected, but that's not automatically a bad thing -- particularly when the debate is focused on substantive issues that are worthy of a significant public debate. And there certainly is no shortage of those.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. One thing that the Republicans on the Hill seem to repeatedly ask for with regard to the Zika funding is a rundown of what exactly is needed for this year versus next year. And that's not an answer that they've gotten either from the White House or, they say, anywhere else in the administration. Is that a number that's noble? Is there a reason that you haven't provided that to them? Because they seem to be pointing to that as the reason that they can't go forward on figuring out what they might be able to free up for this year.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think you get differing explanations depending on who you ask. Obviously there appears to be, based on public reports, an effort to put specific numbers on paper on the Senate side. So certainly members of the Senate -- Democrats and Republicans -- feel like they have necessary information to start working on a bill. We haven't had the top to take a close look at it, so it's unclear at this point whether or not that's something that we would believe is sufficient for the task. So it's a little hard to take seriously criticism from Republicans in the House that they don't have enough information to write the bill when there are Republicans in the Senate who are working with Democrats who are writing a bill.\nI think, separately, what we've also gone to great lengths to try to explain is that while we are concerned about ensuring that we have sufficient resources over the course of this summer and fall to fight Zika, we need to make sure we're laying the groundwork for an effective long-term response. For example, despite the remarkable scientific capacity of the United States and the United States government, our experts do not anticipate that we will have an effective vaccine against Zika available this summer. But if we want to have one available by next summer or the summer after that, we need to start doing research now, and we need to start doing clinical trials now. And we need to demonstrate a commitment from the federal government to be a customer for those vaccines so that private sector entities that have a capacity to manufacture that vaccine will pursue it.\nSo the point is, we are going to need resources and a commitment of resources over the long term. And this is something that we have discussed in both private and in public with members of the House and the Senate. So it's just a little hard to take very seriously these complaints when there's ample information that's been provided. There are a wide range of discussions that have occurred. And those discussions have actually resulted in members of the Senate working in bipartisan fashion to draft legislation. I don't understand why they can't do that in the House.\nQ: But when you talk about long term, I mean, these are emergency funds that are being requested in a supplemental. So you can understand why there might be some opposition on the Hill to providing funding that you're talking about for a long-term response in an emergency fashion. I'm just wondering if you can distinguish between one and the other, if that's possible.\nMR. EARNEST: Right. It's an emergency because we need to start working on that vaccine right now. If we don't start working now on that vaccine -- well, let me say it this way. The most effective way to protect the country from the Zika virus is to develop a vaccine. And we know that developing a vaccine takes time. It also requires a long-term commitment of resources both to conduct clinical trials, but also to manufacture a large quantity of the vaccine so that we can protect a large number of Americans. And every day that goes by now, where we haven't made a long-term commitment to that vaccine, is a day lost to the eventual implementation of that vaccine.\nSo we need a commitment now. And we don't just need a commitment now for two or three months; we need a commitment for a couple of years, so that private sector pharmaceutical companies will know that there will be a customer for their vaccine if they implement the resources now to developing it. And that's why it's urgent. It's urgent because we need to get started now. But it's not just going to apply to this fiscal year because it's going to take more than a year to develop tests and manufacture a vaccine.\nQ: Just one more on a separate issue. Eighty-one senators wrote to the President earlier this week, asking for what they called a substantially enhanced new long-term agreement with Israel with regard to U.S. military aid. Could you give us an update on where the talks stand with regard to sort of closing that 10-year deal? You've been negotiating now since December. We've heard you say repeatedly that the U.S. is willing to increase the level of aid, but it's not clear what the hang-up would be between now and December being able to close the deal on it since Israel and the U.S. both seem to be willing to make an agreement. What's holding it up?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Julie, I think I want to start by just pointing out that the idea for extending this agreement between the United States and Israel originated with President Obama back in 2013. So it's the President who, for I believe three years now, has been advocating for the extension of this agreement. And the idea was that this agreement that I believe extends to -- the agreement that's currently in place I believe extends to 2018. And the thought was that by beginning negotiations early, the United States can provide some significant assurance to the nation of Israel that our commitment to their security is enduring. But over those three years, a lot has happened that has had an impact on the effective coordination related to those negotiations.\nAnd the talks continue. And what the United States has committed to do is to ramp up the assistance that we provide to Israel in a way that would allow Israel to be the recipient of more national security aid than any other country has ever received from the United States. That is an indication of the depth of this country and this administration's commitment to Israel's security. Working out the details, though, is complicated. And there are a number of technical details that have to be worked through. There are also questions related to reaching an assessment of the threat that Israel faces, and making sure that the assistance that is provided is most effectively oriented to counter that threat.\nSo these are issues that take some time to work through, but there is a strong commitment on the part of this administration and on the part of this country to providing resources to the nation of Israel so that they can defend themselves.\nQ: But you're making it sound like the President and this administration is committed to it, and leaving open the question of whether Israel is really willing to come to the table at this point. Have they refused these offers, these repeated offers of the most unprecedented military aid that any nation has ever received from the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think we have acknowledged previously that there was a period prior to last December where there was at least some reticence on the part of the Israelis to engage in these conversations. But those talks were restarted back in December. And since then, there have been active discussions between national security officials in both countries about reaching this agreement.\nAnd I don't have an updated timeframe for you in terms of when we expect an agreement to be completed, but the work to try to reach that agreement remains ongoing.\nSuzanne.\nQ: Josh, you said earlier you weren't listening to Donald Trump's foreign policy speech. And a lot of people, however, really are paying attention to it as he gets closer to the responsibility nomination, including people who are concerned around the world. I'm not asking to dispute point by point what he said, because there was a lot of criticism in saying --\nMR. EARNEST: We might be here a while. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- that the U.S. treated Iran with tender love and care; that the U.S. is not a friend to Israel; that rivals no longer respect us, et cetera -- concluding that the foreign policy is reckless, rudderless, and aimless. Just in general terms, can you tell us what is the President's thinking about what he has hoped to accomplish over the last two terms and his impact around the world. And also, how does the White House prepare for something like this when you have Trump coming out, dissecting this with this kind of criticism? Does the President anticipate world leaders, ambassadors, people starting to make phone calls of concern about what he is saying in light of the fact that he is so close to becoming the nominee?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think you've heard the President already speak at some length about the concerns that he has heard from other world leaders about the tone and tenor of the presidential debate in the United States. The President has already spoken to that. I think when it comes to this President's foreign policy, there is no denying that the United States is safer and stronger than we were when President Obama took office back in January of 2009.\nAnd there are a variety of ways to measure it. You can certainly carefully consider the economic situation of the United States. That certainly has an impact on the influence that we wield around the world. Right now, the U.S. economy, because of the longest streak of private sector job growth in American history that we've enjoyed over the last 73 or so months resulting in more than 14 million private-sector jobs created, the United States continues to be the envy of the world when it comes to having such a durable economy.\nAs it relates to protecting the United States from very specific threats, when President Obama took office, there was a genuine concern about the likelihood that Iran would develop a nuclear weapon. And at the time, the international community was fractured in terms of considering how, exactly, to respond to the situation. But because of President Obama's leadership, we united the world in imposing stringent sanctions on the Iranian government and on the Iranian economy that compelled them to come to the table, and compelled them to agree to a diplomatic agreement that prevents them from obtaining a nuclear weapon and establishes a verification regime, inspections, that allow us to verify that Iran has not developed a nuclear weapon and that they are actually abiding by the terms of the deal.\nWhat we've also seen is a strengthening of our alliances around the world. We've seen an effective renewed focus on the Asia Pacific region that has both positive economic and strategic benefits for the United States.\nSo the President has got a strong record to run on, to say nothing of the advances that we've made in improving our relationship with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere, in part because of the President's historic agreement or policy change to begin normalizing relations with Cuba. This has revolutionized the kinds of relationships that the United States has with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. In fact, a country like Argentina that had long elected leaders that were deeply skeptical of the United States has now elected a leader that President Obama met with just last month who ran on a platform of warmer relations with the United States. It didn't happen by accident. That happened because of a renewed commitment to engagement by this administration in the hemisphere, and a commitment to moving past the kinds of obstacles that have stood in the way of those warmer relations for decades.\nSo historians will have ample opportunity to consider this President's policies, and I wouldn't be surprised if they're the subject of extensive debate over the next several months and through the fall. In fact, we'd welcome that opportunity to have that debate.\nQ: How much of the President's time is really devoted to reassuring allies and others that there's not going to be a dramatic change in foreign policy? Because obviously there are many world leaders and people in the diplomatic community who are very, very concerned about what they hear from Trump.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the President has been clear that this is something that comes up frequently in his conversations, and the President's response has been to reassure them that the President retains significant confidence in the wisdom of the American people to continue to pursue policies that are in the best interest of the United States and are focused on strengthening our alliances around the world, and ensuring the safety and security of the American people.\nQ: On another matter, does the administration have any reaction to former Speaker Denny Hastert, sentenced today by a judge to 15 months imprisonment? The judge calling him a serial child molester, and Hastert apologizing for what he calls \"mistreating boys\" when he was a wrestling coach.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific response to that. Obviously, this is part of our criminal justice system carrying out its mandate. And I don't have a specific response to it.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to ask you a couple things on two different subjects. One, on the issue of Donald Trump, he brought up this issue of foreign policy today. And I want to ask you some things about ISIS. He said once he becomes President, he would eliminate ISIS. In your conversations with world leaders, national security, intelligence officials, as well as generals on the ground, has there ever been any concrete, one-stop-shop, we can eliminate ISIS in your conversations over ISIS?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has been clear about what his strategy is for degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. And this is a strategy that requires intensive cooperation with countries, partners, and allies around the world. And the President devoted a significant portion of his just-completed foreign trip to discussing how to intensify that coordination.\nThe progress that we've made on the ground against ISIL in both Iraq and in Syria has been noteworthy. In Iraq, the calculations are that we have driven ISIL out of about 40 percent of the territory on the ground that they previously controlled. In Syria, the number is somewhat smaller, but it's about 16 percent, which represents important progress. And this isn't just large swaths of unpopulated desert land; these are populated areas that have been retaken from ISIL.\nThe other thing that has attracted a lot of attention in recent days is our ongoing efforts to shut down ISIL's financing. The United States has worked effectively with countries around the world, including countries in the region, to counter ISIL's ability to finance their reign of terror. And we have worked closely with the Emirates, for example, to limit the ability of ISIL to access international financial networks. But we've also been able to coordinate among intelligence officials, finance officials, and military officials to actually carry out military strikes against some of ISIL's cash stockpiles. And there is extensive reporting to indicate that ISIL is now having trouble paying its fighters on time. In some cases, there is even evidence that ISIL has slashed payments to their fighters, and this has had a very negative impact on morale.\nLet me just give you one more example. The President has been focused, dating back to the fall of 2014, on shutting down the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and in Syria. One of the concerns that the international community originally had was that ISIL was able to rather easily replenish its ranks and that even as Iraqi security forces or coalition airstrikes were able to take ISIL fighters off the battlefield, there were so many ISIL fighters from around the world that were being recruited that they could easily replace those fighters who had been killed. There was even more concern about some of those fighters using their passports to return home and carry out attacks in their home countries.\nBecause of the coordinated diplomacy of the United States and many of our partners, we have drastically reduced the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and in Syria. This began with the President chairing a United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss this issue. It was enhanced by the efforts of our allies in Turkey taking important steps to better secure their border with Syria, but we know that the flow of foreign fighters has not been entirely shut off, but it is significantly lower than it was before.\nSo this is all an indication that we have made progress, important progress in the fight against ISIL, progress that has made the American people safer -- progress that has yielded a degradation of ISIL forces. But there's a lot more work to be done. I think the critical part of this is the President is committed to making sure the United States is not doing this alone. This is not a burden that we're going to carry on our own. We're not going to be the world's policeman. We're not going to impose a military solution on this situation. We're going to work carefully with the international community that also has an important stake in this to continue this fight and to continue to make progress in degrading and destroying this terrorist organization.\nQ: You said something critical -- we're not going to impose a military solution. Donald Trump is -- I don't know, didn't get through the weeds with what he was saying --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, you're probably not the only one.\nQ: I'm not saying that to be smart, though. I'm not saying that to be smart. But he said that he could eliminate ISIS. So could a military solution eliminate ISIS?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would encourage you to check with his advisors to get them to explain to you what it means to \"eliminate ISIS.\" Or at least what he means when he says that.\nQ: Before the end of the year, around December or so, President Obama from the Oval Office addressed the nation, and around that time, national security folks were saying that ISIS had been degraded about 25 percent. Are we still around that number, or is it higher or lower, even as they're still carrying out acts of violence and terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: The latest statistics that we've seen is that we've retaken about 40 percent of the territory in Iraq that ISIL previously held, and about 16 percent of the territory in Syria -- populated territory in Syria that ISIL previously held.\nQ: All right. And then on Flint, Michigan, will the President be making any news when he travels there, particularly as it's still an ongoing situation? There have been charges. People are still pointing figures and there are still long-term effects to include the lost generation of kids and some people who were physically harmed by drinking this water.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll just point out that there have already been some serious steps taken by the administration to try to confront some of the potential long-term consequences of the soiled Flint water supply. I can give you a couple of examples.\nThere's been a significant expansion of Medicaid coverage so that more individuals can get access to treatment that would address any problems that they have sustained as a result of increased levels of lead in the water supply. There has been a widespread increase in testing to evaluate the impact on children in Flint as a result of the contaminated water supply.\nQ: What are you finding in that so far?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'd refer you to HHS and they can give you some more details on exactly what those studies and what those tests have found.\nThere also has been work to provide additional assistance -- economic assistance to Flint. The contamination of the water supply has a ripple effect across the economy. You can understand that you're not likely to go and establish a new business in a community that doesn't have access to clean water. So there's a variety of economic assistance that's been provided to the local government and to members of the community as they go through this difficult situation.\nSo we've been mindful of the longer-term challenges that Flint is facing, and we're going to continue to follow through with those commitments.\nAs it relates to the President's trip, I don't have any remarks to preview at this point. I suspect that the fact of the President's trip is news in and of itself. And he certainly is looking forward to the opportunity that he'll have to meet with local officials, to meet with people in the community who have been affected, and both reassure them that the Obama administration is committed to following through on the commitments that we have made, but also making a broader argument to the country about why investments in our infrastructure are so critically important.\nSo we'll have more to say about that next week.\nQ: One last question. Now there are charges, what is up -- can you say what this administration feels is at the root of this problem? Hillary Clinton already said what she felt. What does this President and this administration feel is the root cause of this crisis?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you'll get an opportunity to hear directly from the President on that next week.\nQ: So will he kind of reflect, mirror some of what Hillary Clinton said? Because he's been very vocal when it comes to issues of inequality, the lesser served, and race. Will he mirror her?\nMR. EARNEST: Stay tuned. I'll let you draw that conclusion for yourself.\nRon.\nQ: On the Trump speech, you didn't see it, right?\nMR. EARNEST: I did not.\nQ: Weren't you curious? Didn't you want to? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Not really. (Laughter.)\nQ: Why not?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know. I guess I have plenty more important things to be focused on, to prepare for your serious questions, beyond what any individual presidential candidate might have to say.\nQ: The President was -- one thing about the speech was it was done very differently, apparently. A lot of commentators I think would agree. Even a teleprompter appeared to be used. It was scripted. The setting was much more structured. What do you think of Mr. Trump's effort to do a foreign policy speech in that manner?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've given up trying to divine the intentions of him or any other presidential candidate. Obviously he's got plenty of people on his staff who can describe what they're focused on doing there. But I wouldn't begin to describe what they had in mind.\nQ: You don't think you're being too dismissive of him?\nMR. EARNEST: No. I guess it's an ironic answer. I didn't view it that way. (Laughter.) But, no, I don't think so. Look, our process is structured so that individual voters all across the country can take stock of the candidates, and given the length of this campaign, they've had ample opportunity to take stock of the candidates on both sides. And as the President, himself, said, he's got a lot of confidence in the American people to make the right decision. And he certainly intends to spend some time advocating, making his preferences known. But the time for that will be during the general election.\nQ: On the Flint situation, the timing. These letters were exchanged some time ago, or received some time ago, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President got the letter from this little girl in Flint last month.\nQ: So why now? Did he just receive it? Or is there something about the situation there that he sees that changed his mind about going? Because for so long he said he would not go.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that -- I don't think the President said that he would not go. In terms of --\nQ: But he said he wouldn't go --\nMR. EARNEST: He hadn't scheduled one. And, look, I think the President's goal here is to go to the community of Flint and say in person to the people of Flint what he conveyed in the letter to this little girl, which is, we've not forgotten you. In fact, we're committed to making sure that this community has the support that they need to recover.\nWhat's happened there is terrible. The President, himself, described what he thought it must be like for a parent to look at the news and see that their child has been drinking poisoned water for months, if not years. I think many parents in Flint, like the President imagined, are beside themselves -- they still are. And the President feels it's important to go and signal his continued support for that community even though it's not an everyday headline like it used to be.\nAnd I don't mean that as some sort of criticism of the media, just a practical observation that if you live in the city of Flint, there were satellite trucks and news photographers all over the streets. And understandably, attention has moved on to other things. And the President feels it's important to go back to them and make it clear that while the intention of other people has shifted onto other things, he continues to be focused on making sure that we do right by the people of Flint.\nQ: Just to clarify, there was a federal state of emergency declared, correct? That's still in effect?\nMR. EARNEST: So there was an initial declaration. The President issued an emergency declaration for the state of Michigan that allowed some resources to be provided. There was a broader declaration that was denied simply because of the way the law is written for those broader declarations. Those broader declarations are only allowed to be used in the event of a natural disaster, and this disaster is obviously a man-made one.\nQ: So there will be a federal disaster -- declaring it a federal disaster area, essentially.\nMR. EARNEST: Exactly.\nQ: We've had more calls and discussions with residents out there, and the feeling is -- and as we've talked about before -- there's a huge trust deficit now --\nMR. EARNEST: Sure.\nQ: -- that may not be reparable given what's happened for some certainly. Is there some contemplation by the administration of trying to find some other way to broaden the federal role there going forward? If, in fact, you're saying a disaster area can't be declared between it's a man-made circumstance, does the President feel there is some need for something further -- some reassurance, some declaration, something -- that structures in federal oversight to make sure this problem gets solved?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I don't think that there is anything that the federal government could do in one day that is going to repair the trust that has been broken. I would acknowledge that that's the case.\nI think the way that you rebuild trust in a situation like this is demonstrating a sustained commitment to following through on what you say you're going to do. And what the federal government has said that they were going to do is mobilize resources to help people have access to clean water while the situation with the water supply is being fixed. So that's why you saw FEMA move in. They've now passed out 7.3 million liters of water that has been provided by FEMA to people in Flint; 55,000 water filters and 243,000 replacement filter cartridges.\nSo just meeting the urgent emergency needs of people is certainly an appropriate role for the federal government. You also saw the federal government step in and expand Medicaid coverage so that more individuals up to the age of 21 could get access to reliable health care. You saw grants from the Department of Health and Human Services to local health care officials to make sure they could handle the capacity -- I'm sorry, to expand their capacity so that they could handle the increase in the number of patients that they were going to see on a regular basis. These are just some of the examples of the assistance that's been provided by the federal government.\nSo there certainly is an important role for the federal government to play in responding to a situation like this. What's also true is there's a role for Congress to play. There are additional resources that could be used to make some changes to their aging water infrastructure and to provide additional assistance to help the city of Flint recover and rebuild. Unfortunately, we've seen Republicans refuse to embrace that responsibility, and that's unfortunate. But the President is certainly committed to this. And it is fair to say that the President is interested in any new ideas that are developed about additional assistance that can be provided within the authority of the executive branch. But there certainly is important assistance that could be provided by Congress; we just need to see Republicans stop blocking it.\nAndrew.\nQ: The President travels to Vietnam soon. I was wondering if you could give us the White House position on the lifting of the arms embargo against that country. And if you do support them, what would you like to see the Vietnamese do in return for that being lifted?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, Andrew, I'm not aware of a change in our position. Obviously we'll keep you posted if something like that is being contemplated in advance of the trip. I anticipate that the President, when he travels to Vietnam, will actually spend most of his time talking about the increased focus of the United States on the Asia Pacific region. Vietnam has a dynamic economy and they have a rapidly growing middle class. And it's a country that is trying to decide exactly how it's going to orient its economy in the decades ahead. And there's an opportunity for the United States, through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, to which Vietnam is a party, to raise labor and environmental standards in a way that creates more of a level playing field for American businesses.\nThat means that Vietnamese businesses that are interested in doing business in the United States need to change the way that they operate on a regular basis. What it also means is it means that U.S. businesses will have more access to that growing middle class in Vietnam. It's a win-win for the U.S. economy. And the President will certainly highlight that win-win when he travels to Vietnam. He'll also illustrate the risk that is posed by rejecting this agreement.\nWhat we know is that China would love to strengthen and deepen their economic ties with Vietnam. They recognize the same economic opportunities in Vietnam that we do. But if China is able to establish a foothold in Vietnam, China will surely say, well, we don't really care anything about your labor standards, we don't care anything about your environmental standards, we certainly don't care anything about the human rights standards in your country -- we just want to look for ways to do more business. There will be a race to the bottom, and that will only put American businesses at a greater disadvantage in trying to expand opportunities in one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\nSo it's a pretty simple strategic calculation. It's just one that we're going to continue to explain, and there's no better way to do that than having the President travel to that country directly.\nQ: And on a separate issue, one thing you may have agreed with Trump on today was his suggestion that U.S. allies are not pulling their weight when it comes to the security program. Is the President considering deploying naval and reconnaissance assets to the central Mediterranean, or is that a job for the Europeans?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President in his discussions with our European allies in Europe over the weekend and earlier this week did talk about the significant national security of the situation that exists in the central Mediterranean. The flow of migrants across the Mediterranean Sea into southern Europe represents a significant challenge for our European allies. It has significant consequences for their national security. And the President pointed out it wasn't just their national security that was at risk, but the U.S. national security is affected as well. So we certainly have a stake in their ability to resolve that situation.\nI don't have anything to announce, and the President certainly didn't have anything to announce in the aftermath of those meetings, but I think that should be a pretty clear indication to you that the United States is prepared to offer our support as they work to find an appropriate solution.\nWhat's also true is the President did take advantage of the opportunity with some of strongest our allies in the world sitting around the same table to make clear that we all need to follow through on commitments that we've made as it relates to funding our defense capacities. There was a commitment that was made by our NATO allies a couple of years ago at the NATO meeting in the U.K., I believe, where each of the countries of NATO committed to dedicating 2 percent of their GDP to defense spending. The United States far exceeds that goal. Our allies in the U.K. have met that goal, but too many others haven't. And the President reminded all of them of the importance of meeting that goal, particularly in the face of threats from ISIL, a migration flow in southern Europe that is potentially destabilizing, and a steady increase in provocations from the Russians.\nThis is exactly the wrong time for our closest allies in the world to be insufficiently funding their defense capabilities. It's only by working together -- that's the essence of an alliance -- working together and adequately funding our capacity to work together is the way for us to provide for our mutual defense. And the President certainly did make that case to his partners and our allies in the context of that meeting and other meetings that he's convened with them in recent months and years.\nQ: Is it fair to say that the President might be reluctant to deploy U.S. assets, should he see that Europeans are not willing to put their own assets on the line as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the point of setting this two percent goal is ensuring that when a situation does arise that requires a commitment of resources, that our partners have the capacity to follow through on those commitments.\nQ: Sorry, I was specifically talking about the central Mediterranean.\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, okay. I mean, as it relates to that specific situation, we're obviously going to work closely with our European allies as they consider an appropriate response. But the President I think was pretty blunt in saying that the potential impact of the situation there doesn't just have an impact on national security in Europe, it has an impact on the national security of the United States. And I think that would signal to you that the United States is prepared to actively support our European allies as they confront this challenge.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to extend the conversation about the NSC that you had, in particular acknowledging that National Security Advisor Rice has, in fact, trimmed her staff. Tell me about Mac Thornberry's suggestion that the NSC could be cut significantly more than that -- is he off-base? And if so, how?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I think even just the conversation in the briefing today is a useful illustration of the wide range of threats and challenges that is being confronted by our national security professionals every day. And ensuring that the Commander-in-Chief has access to the information and judgment of his advisors not just here in the White House but across a variety of national security agencies is critically important.\nThere are a number of diplomatic and -- well, let me say it this way: One way to ensure effective decision-making is to effectively coordinate the actions of all of the different agencies that are involved in protecting the country. And that is essentially the core function of the National Security Council -- to make sure that all of these agencies who have significant responsibilities related to national security are effectively coordinated so that they can provide effective advice and information to the President of the United States, but also so that decisions that are made by the President of the United States are effectively implemented by that wide array of agencies.\nSo given the risks that we are -- the wide range of risks that this country is confronting right now, it shouldn't be surprising to anybody that there is a robust structure in place, here at the White House, to make sure that these decisions are made and implemented effectively.\nQ: And yet there has been criticism by some former Defense Secretaries that the West Wing is effectively trying to override, for lack of a more descriptive word, the intentions of the Pentagon, for example. In fact, one said, all too often they were subject to second-guessing, even to direct conversations of commanders on the ground, coming from the NSC. Is that the proper role?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I think that it's probably true over the course of our nation's history that every Secretary of Defense has expressed some frustration about working with the White House. That is a built-in part of being part of the government. That's also part of being part of the chain of command. And I think the President is proud -- I can tell you confidently that the President is proud of the performance of the Secretaries of Defense that have served under him. He certainly is proud of the performance of Secretary Carter. It doesn't mean that he's taken their advice every time. He hasn't. He's the President of the United States. They're the Secretary of Defense. It's their responsibility to offer up their advice.\nHe surely has taken their advice more often than not, and I think a lot of our frustration actually stems from Congress refusing to take the advice of our Secretaries of Defense over the years. And whether that is failing to pass an authorization to use military force, something that our Secretaries of Defense have strongly advocated, our Secretaries of Defense -- I think all of them -- have actually time and again gone to Congress and asked for spending reforms that would save taxpayers money and make our national defense stronger. But yet, those reforms have not been implemented.\nSo there is a strong record of this White House working effectively with leaders of the military, civilian and military, at the Department of Defense to implement policies that have made the country safer. And the President is certainly proud of the service of his Secretaries of Defense, and he's certainly proud of the way those decisions and the implementation of those policies has made our country safer.\nQ: Just to put a finer point on it, some of the suggestion was that the NSC is meddling -- sort of they've got his ear ahead of his direct Cabinet Secretaries.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I just disagree. I think the President carefully considered the advice that he received from each of his Secretaries of Defense. He valued that advice, and it played an important role as he made critically important policy decisions throughout this presidency.\nQ: Last one. The President has done well in communicating with young voters. There is a sense in 2016, a greater sense of disenfranchisement -- that the process is rigged. You've heard that both on the Republican and on the Democratic side, and in particular some young voters feel like the fix is in. What would the President say to young voters, in particular as we get closer to the conventions, about the process that they're seeing here in 2016?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President's message to young voters is the message that he has for all Americans, which is simply that casting a vote is the most effective and powerful way to have your voice heard. The President has talked about this most frequently I think in the context of the debate about gun safety. The President has been greatly frustrated, profoundly frustrated at repeated congressional inaction and obstruction when it comes to common-sense gun-safety bills. And the President I think has been pretty blunt about the fact that he doesn't expect that environment in Congress to change until voters make their voices heard and until voters make clear that this is something that is a priority to them.\nSo the President wasn't signaling that this environment would change if some billionaire started a super PAC. It's possible that could be the case, but there have already been super PACs created by billionaires that have tried to make this change that haven't succeeded, at least as much as we would like them to. The way that this will get fixed, the way that we'll see common-sense legislation passed that doesn't undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans is when voters across the country make clear that this is a priority to them. And they can do that in only one way, and that's by casting their votes accordingly. And I think that's a powerful message about the responsibility that citizens in every party of every age all across the country has to contribute to our democracy and to make our country great.\nQ: Let me ask one on Chief Judge Garland. Any new activities coming down on him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, he is doing a handful of meetings today. He is meeting with Senator Rounds of South Dakota and Senator Nelson of Florida. He's also doing a meeting with Senators Lankford and Inhofe of Oklahoma.\nI point this out because we also saw some interesting comments for former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn yesterday -- maybe it was earlier today that he made these comments. He was often referred to as the conscience of the Senate, and he made clear, in his typical avuncular style, that the Senate should do its job, and that there's no excuse for Republicans refusing to consider voting on the nomination of Chief Judge Garland.\nI don't think that he was vowing to vote for Chief Judge Garland if he were still in the Senate, but he was saying he would at least do his job. He would meet with the Chief Judge, and he would stand up before the American people and cast a vote. Obviously we would make a strong case to him that Chief Judge Garland is deserving of his support, but there is no denying, there's no argument, even among people who disagree with the administration, about the wisdom of appointing Chief Judge Garland to the Supreme Court -- that at the very least, the President's nominee deserves a hearing and a vote.\nAnd hopefully that counsel from the former Republican senator of Oklahoma will have an influence over the current Republican senators from Oklahoma.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. When the President was in London, he said that, on Syria, that we'd looked at all the options and none of them are great. I'm wondering if the President has asked his Defense Department for any options that would make it more difficult for the Assad regime to kill as many civilians as it has, something short of a full occupation, but something that would make it more difficult for the Assad regime that seems to have pretty much carte blanche to kill civilians. Has the President asked for any options that would specifically deal with that without going as far as a full no-fly zone or a full occupation in Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, I guess I would just tell you that you should take the President at his word that he has directed his team to consider all options about the best way for the United States to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL and to do it in a way that is consistent with our national security interests and our objectives.\nConducting another ground invasion of another Middle Eastern country is not in our interest. We've learned the lessons of the previous war in Iraq. We know that we've got the best military in the world -- primarily because the United States has the best sailors and soldiers and Marines and airmen in the world. But risking their lives to go occupy another country, put them in harm's way, and to spend billions of dollars -- hundreds of billions of dollars to risk their lives, thinking that we can impose a military solution on another country is foolish.\nThat's not a criticism of our military. It's a criticism of policymakers who have failed to understand the consequences of making a decision like that.\nSo the President and the national security advisors and policymakers on his team are aware of those consequences and they have considered all of those consequences as they've looked for the best way for us to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL and bring about the kind of political transition inside of Syria that is long overdue. And we're going to continue to press the Russians to use the influence that they have with the Assad regime to bring an end to the violence and engage in talks about a political transition. We're going to continue to marshal the other influential countries in the region to encourage the opposition to engage constructively in those negotiations.\nUltimately, it's a political solution that's required. President Assad's failed political leadership is the root cause of all of these problems, and the only way we're going to solve them is to allow for a political transition to a new leader that reflects the will and ambition of the Syrian people, that has the capacity to unite that country to counter the extremist threat that has encroached on their territory.\nAnd I wouldn't make the case to you that that's a simple solution. It certainly is not a solution that we're likely to see be imposed overnight. But it is the only solution that will achieve the objectives that the President has outlined.\nQ: The President also said that we're going to play this option out if the cessation falls apart, the U.S. going to try to put it together, and I think that stands in a bit of a contrast to folks who were talking about a plan B earlier on in this process. And I'm wondering if there still is a plan B. Is that something that the President and his advisors are still looking at in terms of what to do if the cessation falls apart?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, I think this is exactly what the President was answering when he said he and his advisors have looked at all of the options and that none of them are good, and the United States is committed to supporting the international process to bring about a political transition inside of Syria.\nLook, even the Russians have indicated that they believe a political transition is what's required. So it's just going to require the international community continuing to chip away at this problem and try to bring all the parties to the table and jumpstart this process. But there's no denying how difficult that is or how long it's likely to take.\nQ: A few more on Mr. Trump. You say you have better things to do than to watch or listen to the speech. Is that indicative of the point of view of the White House generally? In other words, how seriously does this White House take the foreign policy or the lack thereof of Mr. Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's indicative of the substantive questions I expected to receive in the context of this briefing, so I certainly take seriously my responsibility to try to prepare for it.\nLook, I think what I said is true, is that the American people will carefully consider the presentations of candidates in both parties and they'll be watching closely, particularly when making a decision as important as who should be the Commander-in-Chief.\nSo in some ways, it doesn't really matter whether or not, in my context as a White House spokesperson, I spend a lot of time watching the speeches delivered by other candidates. I suppose that it does matter in the context of me as a voter. But in this case, the American people will have an opportunity to decide.\nQ: -- the President himself -- Mr. Trump, after all, is the man who calls himself the presumptive Republican nominee. How seriously does the President take this speech? I don't think he had time to watch it because of a lunch with the Vice President, but how will he be informed of it, and how interested is he in what was actually said?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the one candidate that you named has certainly not struggled to get attention from all of you. And the President, as somebody who is an avid consumer of the media -- as you've heard me observe on a number of occasions -- so he certainly is aware of the debate that's going on in the presidential race on both sides. And you won't have any -- again, given the amount of attention that's been lavished on a couple of these candidates, the President doesn't have any trouble keeping up to speed on what they're saying.\nQ: One more, and I'll try and make it substantive. When Donald Trump says he wants to bring peace to the world, what do you make of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is true is that President Obama, over the course of his presidency, has worked to unite the international community to confront a wide range of threats. And that is everything from uniting the international community, to completing an agreement to fight climate change. That is making the American people safer. And that is evidence of the United States using our influence to work with China and other countries with large economies to make an agreement like this possible.\nThis is also true when it comes to Iran and their nuclear program. As I mentioned, when President Obama took office, the international community was fractured in terms of considering how exactly to confront Iran in their nuclear ambitions. But President Obama demonstrated the leadership that was required to unite the international community behind a strategy that would impose sanctions on Iran until they came to the table and committed in a verifiable fashion to not pursuing a nuclear weapon. That's exactly what we've done. That has also made the world safer.\nAt the same time, the President has not hesitated to order military action where necessary to protect the American people. President Obama after all -- we're coming up on the fifth anniversary of President Obama deciding to order our military to go after Osama bin Laden. And because of the bravery and courage and dedication of our national security professionals, including our men and women in uniform, that operation was successful. And that certainly has enhanced our national security and made the American people safer. That's just one example of countless military operations that President Obama as a Commander-in-Chief has ordered to take terrorists off the battlefield.\nAnd again, it's a testament to the bravery, courage and professionalism and skill of our men and women in uniform that those operations have taken a large number of terrorists off the battlefield. That has made the American people safer. That's made the world a safer place. But there continue to be threats. And the President's success in strengthening our alliances and strengthening our partnerships around the world, building a coalition of 65 nations to counter ISIL, including a number of Muslim-majority nations in the Middle East, have all been advances that have enhanced our standing in the world and enhanced our national security. And so the President's record on those issues is quite strong, and to the extent that anybody wants to have a debate about that, the President will not shy away from it.\nDave.\nQ: Has the White House been in touch with former Senator Coburn about the nomination?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know of any -- I certainly don't know of any presidential-level conversations with former Senator Coburn about Chief Judge Garland's nomination.\nQ: Any sub-presidential talks?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: Do you know of any sub-presidential-level talks?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any off the top of my head, but I wouldn't rule them out either.\nQ: One other thing. There's a House subcommittee tomorrow that's holding a hearing on the President's plan to transfer Gitmo detainees to the U.S. There's going to be some local officials from South Carolina -- Governor Haley and some people from Kansas testifying in opposition to the plan, calling it dangerous. At this point, do you see any encouraging signs that Congress will take up your plan and move forward on it this year? Or it is a dead-end?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's unclear. There's no evidence I can point to. I think I would just point out that there are national security professionals on both sides who think that it's dangerous to keep the prison at Guantanamo Bay open and that the proposal that the President has put forward is actually that makes us safer.\nJust to go back to your previous question, even though I don't know of any conversations between White House or administration officials and former Senator Coburn, obviously Senator Coburn was a pretty conservative Republican, and his personal affection for President Obama is well-known and certainly transcends their partisan differences, but I don't have any reason to believe that he was communicating anything other than his own personal view with his own personal conviction about how important it is for the Senate to vote on Chief Judge Garland's nomination because it's their constitutional responsibility to do so.\nJohn, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. When the President met with Chancellor Merkel, did they have any discussions -- as we were previously led to expect -- about the continuing and rising economic crisis in Greece, as well as the refugee crisis?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any more details to share in terms of their private conversation. But I think I can just say as a general matter that there are a range of issues that were discussed that have a direct impact on the unity of the EU. And obviously questions about the economy and the financial health of the European Union is something that was discussed, but I don't know in how much detail they discussed the situation in Greece.\nQ: And is there any concern within the White House about what appears to be an obvious deadlock between the creditors over the Greek debt situation and the International Monetary Fund?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any detailed knowledge of those ongoing discussions. Obviously we're very supportive of the efforts that members of the EU have made to deal with the financial challenges posed by Greece's finances. Part of that agreement included Greece following through on a number of structural reforms, and we certainly believe that Greece has a responsibility to do that. But we've been clear all along that effective coordination among Greece and the other EU was going to be critical to resolving that situation in a way that didn't undermine the fundamentals of the European economy.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:36 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-04-27", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

As a matter of public policy, the Administration remains focused on the changes needed to make the greatest impact on student outcomes in the Nation's public education system.

Trump detailed his views on critical foreign policy issues, making it abundantly clear that he is committed to prioritizing America first in national security, international diplomacy and global trade.\n\"Today, our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There's no vision, no strategic purpose, no direction, no consistency.\"\nIn his speech before The National Interest Magazine and its parent institution, The Center for the National Interest, and invited guests, the presumptive GOP nominee for President of the United States articulated five important criticisms of American foreign policy: the nation's resources are overextended; many of our allies aren't paying their fair share; our friends fear they can't depend on us; our rivals no longer respect us – and the country doesn't have clear foreign policy goals.\n\"All of this is going to change when I am President,\" he said. \"America is going to be strong again. America is going to be a reliable friend and ally again.\"\nAs President, he would ensure the defeat of ISIS as a major foreign policy goal. \"I have a simple message for ISIS: Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how. We must, as a nation, be strong and resilient. They're going to be gone.\"\nThe front-runner also pledged to rebuild America's military and the national economy – two vital pillars of a peaceful and secure world. \"We will spend what we need to rebuild our military. Our military dominance must be unquestioned,\" he said. \"We are also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again – and to put Americans first again.\"\nAfter criticizing the \"reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy\" of President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump outlined a more coherent international vision. \"Our foreign policy goals must be based on America's core national security interests,\" he said. He pledged to defeat radical Islam in the Middle East and to focus on stability in the region, not nation-building. Recognizing the differences America has with China and Russia, he also vowed to \"seek common ground based on shared interests.\"\n\"My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations centered on prioritizing America first. Under a Trump Administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of foreign countries,\" he said.\nMr. Trump's prepared remarks can be viewed here: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-foreign-policy-speech", "timestamp": "2016-04-27", "title": "Press Release - Donald J.

It's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold.\nThe direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people, and American security, above all else. That will be the foundation of every decision that I will make.\nAmerica First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration.\nBut to chart our path forward, we must first briefly look back.\nWe have a lot to be proud of. In the 1940s we saved the world. The Greatest Generation beat back the Nazis and the Japanese Imperialists.\nThen we saved the world again, this time from totalitarian Communism. The Cold War lasted for decades, but we won.\nDemocrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan when he said: \"tear down this wall.\"\nHistory will not forget what we did.\nUnfortunately, after the Cold War, our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense.\nLogic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, and this led to one foreign policy disaster after another.\nWe went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama's line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos, and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper.\nIt all began with the dangerous idea that we could make Western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a Western Democracy.\nWe tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism; thousands of American lives, and many trillions of dollars, were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill the void, much to their unjust enrichment.\nOur foreign policy is a complete and total disaster.\nNo vision, no purpose, no direction, no strategy.\nToday, I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.\nFirst, Our Resources Are Overextended\nPresident Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He's crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders.\nOur manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year. We're rebuilding other countries while weakening our own.\nEnding the theft of American jobs will give us the resources we need to rebuild our military and regain our financial independence and strength.\nI am the only person running for the Presidency who understands this problem and knows how to fix it.\nSecondly, our allies are not paying their fair share.\nOur allies must contribute toward the financial, political and human costs of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so. They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us.\nIn NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries, besides America, are spending the minimum required 2% of GDP on defense.\nWe have spent trillions of dollars over time – on planes, missiles, ships, equipment – building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia. The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense – and, if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.\nThe whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security.\nA Trump Administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded.\nThirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can't depend on us.\nWe've had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies.\nHe negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms, even before the ink was dry.\nIran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon and, under a Trump Administration, will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\nAll of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran's treatment of our ten captured sailors.\nIn negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table. When the other side knows you're not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win.\nAt the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them.\nPresident Obama gutted our missile defense program, then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic.\nHe supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel – and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.\nIsrael, our great friend and the one true Democracy in the Middle East, has been snubbed and criticized by an Administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel – a force for justice and peace – for acting as an impediment to peace in the region.\nPresident Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power in the Middle East – all at the expense of Israel, our other allies in the region and, critically, the United States.\nWe've picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they're starting to look elsewhere for help.\nFourth, our rivals no longer respect us.\nIn fact, they are just as confused as our allies, but an even bigger problem is that they don't take us seriously any more.\nWhen President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there to meet or greet him – perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One.\nThen, amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia -- it's called no respect.\nDo you remember when the President made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark to get the Olympics for our country, and, after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth place?\nHe should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment.\nThe list of humiliations goes on and on.\nPresident Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands even further with its nuclear reach.\nOur president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade rules – or apply the leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea.\nHe has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engage in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies.\nWe've let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything.\nIf President Obama's goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.\nFinally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals.\nSince the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the Soviet Union, we've lacked a coherent foreign policy.\nOne day we're bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians, the next day we are watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls apart.\nWe're a humanitarian nation. But the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion, and disarray.\nWe have made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before.\nWe left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.\nOur actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS.\nAnd we're in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won't even name the enemy!\nHillary Clinton also refuses to say the words \"radical Islam,\" even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees.\nAfter Secretary Clinton's failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep! Incredible.\nClinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie. Our Ambassador was murdered and our Secretary of State misled the nation – and by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o'clock in the morning.\nAnd now ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil.\nThis will change when I am president.\nTo all our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be a reliable friend and ally again.\nWe're going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests, and the shared interests of our allies.\nWe are getting out of the nation-building business, and instead focusing on creating stability in the world.\nOur moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water's edge.\nWe need a new, rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, as well as by our close allies.\nThis is how we won the Cold War, and it's how we will win our new and future struggles.\nFirst, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam.\nContaining the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States.\nEvents may require the use of military force. But it's also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.\nIn this we're going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence.\nWe should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street – they must also be good to us and remember us and all we are doing for them.\nThe struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more.\nWe must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies.\nA pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or worse -- all you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th.\nAnd then there's ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how. We must as, a nation, be more unpredictable. But they're going to be gone. And soon.\nSecondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy.\nThe Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look what's happened to us!\nOur nuclear weapons arsenal – our ultimate deterrent – has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal.\nOur active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today.\nThe Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during that time.\nThe Air Force is about 1/3 smaller than 1991. Pilots are flying B-52s in combat missions today which are older than most people in this room.\nAnd what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that, in real dollars, cuts nearly 25% from what we were spending in 2011.\nOur military is depleted, and we're asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.\nWe will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned.\nBut we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, not one dollar can be wasted.\nWe are also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again – and to put Americans first again. This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenue and increase our economic might as a nation.\nWe need to think smarter about areas where our technological superiority gives us an edge. This includes 3-D printing, artificial intelligence and cyberwarfare.\nA great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute. A Trump Administration will give our service men and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve, and the best care in the world when they return as veterans to civilian life.\nFinally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests.\nBusinesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries.\nLook at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were attacked and seventeen brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole. And what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China to the World Trade Organization – which has been a disaster for the United States – than into stopping Al Qaeda.\nWe even had an opportunity to take out Osama Bin Laden, and didn't do it. And then, we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the worst attack on our country in its history.\nOur foreign policy goals must be based on America's core national security interests, and the following will be my priorities.\nIn the Middle East, our goals must be to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clear-sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies.\nAnd we must only be generous to those that prove they are our friends.\nWe desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes. But we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests. Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism.\nI believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia – from a position of strength – is possible. Common sense says this cycle of hostility must end. Some say the Russians won't be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can't make a good deal for America, then we will quickly walk from the table.\nFixing our relations with China is another important step towards a prosperous century. China respects strength, and by letting them take advantage of us economically, we have lost all of their respect. We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit we must find a way, quickly, to balance.\nA strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways.\nAfter I am elected President, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies, and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges.\nFor instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO's outdated mission and structure – grown out of the Cold War – to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.\nI will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must fight to win. I will never send our finest into battle unless necessary – and will only do so if we have a plan for victory.\nOur goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction.\nThe best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy.\nWith President Obama and Secretary Clinton we've had the exact opposite: a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy – one that has blazed a path of destruction in its wake.\nAfter losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worse shape now in the Middle East than ever before.\nI challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama-Clinton – it has been a complete and total disaster.\nI will also be prepared to deploy America's economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very persuasive – but we need to use them selectively and with determination. Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules.\nOur friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce it.\nHowever, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are signs of strength.\nAlthough not in government service, I was totally against the War in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary was Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their rich oil reserves – something it has wanted to do for decades. And now, to top it all off, we have ISIS.\nMy goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations.\nThat is why I will also look for talented experts with new approaches, and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war.\nFinally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread \"universal values\" that not everyone shares, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.\nThese are my goals, as president.\nI will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, and which our friends and allies will respect and welcome.\nThe world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies.\nTo achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership again.\nMany Americans must wonder why our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than their own.\nAmericans must know that we are putting the American people first again. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy – the jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.\nNo country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must do the same.\nWe will no longer surrender this country, or its people, to the false song of globalism.\nThe nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down, and will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.\nNAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the U.S. and has emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. Never again. Only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. Their will be consequences for companies that leave the U.S. only to exploit it later.\nUnder a Trump Administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of foreign countries.\nI will view the world through the clear lens of American interests.\nI will be America's greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.\nThe world is most peaceful, and most prosperous, when America is strongest.\nAmerica will continually play the role of peacemaker.\nWe will always help to save lives and, indeed, humanity itself. But to play that role, we must make America strong again.\nWe must make America respected again. And we must make America great again.\nIf we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever known.

Hello. Thank you so much for joining us as we start the 100 Day Countdown to the thrilling moment when we let the games begin. I'm really honored to be here today.\nI want to start by thanking Jordan -- where did Jordan go? Hey, Jordan. What's going on? -- for that really kind introduction. We're so proud of him. We're excited to have him compete in this Summer Olympic Games. I also want to thank the outstanding leaders from the U.S. Olympic Committee who are joining me on this stage. You guys, thank you so much for all your great work -- as well as The Band Perry, who is one of our favorites. I want to thank them for being here. Coach Auriemma, thank you all so much for everything you're doing.\nAnd, of course, most of all, I want to thank these incredible athletes who are here today. I have to turn around and look at them because I just got here. (Laughter.) They look so good! (Laughter.) I want to recognize them for the extraordinary work that they've been doing. I'm proud, I'm honored to be in the presence of these Olympians and Paralympians.\nIn fact, this is kind of a dream come true for me, because I'm here today not just as the First Lady, but as a real, lifelong, die-hard Olympics fan. To this day, I still remember the excitement that I felt as a little girl growing up on the South Side of Chicago when Olympic season would roll around. My family and all the kids in our neighborhood, we would gather around somebody's TV somewhere in the neighborhood, and we would watch for hours as our Olympic favorites would compete -- whether it was Mary Lou Retton, or Carl Lewis. I mean, I could go on. I mean, these times meant the world to kids in neighborhoods all over the country.\nWe would all have our favorite sports. My dad, who happened to have MS, was an Olympic fan because he was one of those guys, because he couldn't walk, those games meant the world to him to be able to watch. So we all had our favorite athletes. We had our favorite sports. And then once the games were over, we would all run outside and set up some makeshift hurdle or some balance beam, and we'd try to imitate our heroes.\nAnd that's really what the Olympic Games are all about. One of the reasons I wanted to be here today to kick this off, to be a part of the 100 Day sort of celebration is that we're not just talking about bringing home the gold -- which we will, right? (Applause.) Okay, we're going to do that. It's not that we're just proudly representing the United States to the rest of the world -- which I know these Olympians will do so well. But the Olympics are also about inspiring young people here at home, truly, to get them active, and to live up to the example that our Olympic and Paralympic athletes have always set with their dedication, their determination, their unyielding commitment to excellence.\nAnd we want to bring that Olympic spirit all across this country and into big cities and tiny towns, and to kids and families like mine, like I was at that age -- wherever they may be watching the Olympics these days, whether it's around the TV or a smartphone -- I don't know what people do today -- but to cheer on our U.S. team, but to bring that spirit into communities.\nWe also want our young people to be inspired by the amazing stories of these athletes -- the endless hours that they've devoted to get to this day, the countless sacrifices that these men and women make to do the sport that they love. All the hardship that they've overcome to get to this day -- we want our kids to know about that. Because we want to show our young people that if they work hard enough, and if they dream big enough, they can achieve what they want.\nAnd these men and women are really the best role models for our kids. So we don't just want our young people to watch them, we want them to try these sports themselves. I mean, I know so many of these folks up here probably got started because they were watching some hero and they tried something new. And we want more and more of our kids to develop into that next generation of athletes and fans and sports enthusiasts.\nSo that's why I'm really thrilled to announce that the USOC and 16 of its national governing bodies will be providing opportunities for nearly 2 million kids across this country to participate in Olympic sports in their own communities. They're going to have access to everything from basketball and tennis to things like fencing and judo -- maybe things that kids usually don't have access to. Because so many of these kids in our country, they never have access to these kind of opportunities.\nThey won't just be learning athletic skills; the cool thing is they're going to be learning life skills as well -- like discipline, team work, and of course, the importance of giving 100 percent to everything that they do.\nThey're also going to be learning what I always talk about are life habits -- the habits that we've been emphasizing through the past six years through the Let's Move! initiative -- habits like staying active, fueling your body with good food so that you can actually compete in the way that you need to.\nSo that's why I'm here. I am a fan. I'm ready for this. I want the country to start gearing up for the Olympics like we used to when we were little. I want everybody glued to the TV, trying out sports, thinking about getting up off that couch, competing with your neighbor, but most importantly, cheering these men and women on.\nSo I want to thank the USOC, as well as the Partnership for a Healthier America for making these opportunities available to kids across the country. I also want to thank the folks at NBC who are going to be promoting these opportunities through the Gold Map initiative that they just talked about this morning, and other efforts that they're going to be using to expose young people to Olympic sports and encouraging them to get active.\nAnd finally, I want to thank our Olympic and Paralympic athletes for representing our country in Brazil. We wish them all the luck in the world -- although they don't need it because they're super bad! (Laughter.) They're already awesome. They're already going to kick butt. (Laughter.) But we want them to continue to make us proud as athletes, of course, more importantly, as role models and as the outstanding ambassadors to this country that we know they will be.\nAnd with that, I'm going to actually stop talking -- and they told me I have to actually try some things. So wish me luck. You all be easy on me, all right? (Laughter.)\nSo thank you all so much. God bless. And, of course, go, Team USA!

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123344", "text": "JANSING: You just said that you're in this campaign to win.\nSANDERS: Right.\nJANSING: Do you see a viable path?\nSANDERS: Look, we are clearly the underdog. I'm very good at arithmetic. I think Secretary Clinton is 300-plus delegates ahead of us and we're going to have to do very well here in Indiana, we're going to have to do well in California, our largest state, and other states.\nAnd the other thing that we're going to have to do is make the case to the super delegates, many hundreds of whom came onboard Secretary Clinton before I even announced. You know, they were with her way back when. And make the case to them that what is most important is that a Republican not gain control over the White House. And I think in any objective assessment of political reality Bernie Sanders is a much stronger candidate against Donald Trump than is Hillary Clinton.\nAnd that's just not me talking, I mean, that's poll after poll, state polls, national polls. And the reason for that is we are appealing to independents and some Republicans, interestingly enough, who are tired of establishment politics and establishment economics who would prefer a Bernie Sanders than a Hillary Clinton.\nJANSING: Some supporters are saying she has 3 million more votes.\nSANDERS: In the Democratic primary, sure. I understand that. But look at (AUDIO GAP) where many of - I'll give you an example, just yesterday there were five primaries. We did badly in three, we did okay in Connecticut, we won in Rhode Island. The one state that we won was an open primary. Well you know what, the general election is open.\nIf you're an independent, you can vote for a Democrat, you can vote for a Republican. We are winning in the Democratic primary and caucus process independents, I think, roughly two to one compared to Hillary Clinton. So, it's not me. Every poll that's out there, national and statewide, shows Bernie Sanders defeating Trump by a significantly larger margin in many cases than is Hillary Clinton.\nJANSING: But of course the nominee is elected by delegates.\nSANDERS: Yes.\nJANSING: You are far behind. The lead seems almost I insurmountable. Do you believe if you're not the nominee that you and your voters are owed something at the convention?\nSANDERS: [inaudible] of owed something at the convention, if - if I am not the nominee, and we're going to fight for every last vote and we hope to become the nominee, we have run this campaign on a set of principles, and the principles are that we have to take on the billionaire class whose greed and recklessness are doing terrible damage to working families all over this country.\nWe need to join the rest of the industrialized world, guarantee health care to all people as a right, have paid family and medical leave, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and make public colleges and universities tuition free among many other issues.\nJANSING: So, how much influence...\nSANDERS: To my mind…\nJANSING: ... should you have on the platform?\nSANDERS: Well, it depends, obviously, if we have a majority of delegates that will be the platform. If we do not have a majority of delegates, I would think that any smart presidential candidate will say millions of people are supporting Bernie Sanders, they want an agenda that goes beyond establishment economics and establishment politics, and I'm smart, I'm going to listen to those people and, in fact, create a progressive agenda, not just to appease Bernie Sanders and his supporters, but to winning this election because it is far more important to speak to the middle class and working class of this country than just the billionaire campaign contributors.\nJANSING: Do you believe Hillary Clinton is smart?\nSANDERS: Oh, god yes, she is very smart.\nJANSING: Let me ask you about something Donald Trump said today, because he looks more and more...\nSANDERS: Oh, what was it Donald Trump - now the media's - the media - major function of media is to follow the Donald Trump quote of the day.\nJANSING: But more and more...\nSANDERS: My eating habits.\nJANSING: More and more it does look like he's going to be the nominee...\nSANDERS: Yes.\nJANSING: ... on the Republican side, so either you or Hillary Clinton is going to have to run against him.\nSANDERS: Yes, it would be my pleasure.\nJANSING: He said he would look to your speeches for very good material against Hillary Clinton, starting with she has bad judgment.\nSANDERS: Well look, the Republican party will have dozens of oppositional researchers. They don't need my speeches to talk about Hillary Clinton. They will go after Hillary Clinton, by the way, in ways that I have never, ever gone after Hillary Clinton. I mean, things like the Clinton Foundation, or things like the e-mail situation.\nI don't talk about that. I have never talked about it one word on this campaign. I suspect very much that Donald Trump and the Republican party will go after her in many, many ways that we have not.\nJANSING: But if he says she has bad judgment, you wouldn't disagree?\nSANDERS: It depends -- well, I think Donald Trump's not - not that Donald Trump has bad judgment, I don't think Donald Trump has any judgment whatsoever. When you have a candidate like Donald Trump who every single day is attacking a different group of people, whether they're Mexicans, or Muslims, or veterans, or women or African-Americans, this is a man without any judgment, without the demeanor, and I -- I think the vast majority of the American people, no matter what their political views are, do not believe that Donald Trump has the demeanor or the judgment to become president of the United States.\nJANSING: You suggested he's...\nSANDERS: That's why he's way behind.\nJANSING: You suggested he's dangerous and if he is the likely - if he is the nominee, he is the likely nominee, does your continuing criticism of Hillary Clinton, if she's the nominee, hurt the Democrats' chances of pushing forward your agenda of winning the White House?\nSANDERS: Look, this is media stuff, this is media stuff, okay? And I think this is what media focuses on.\nJANSING: You don't think you're hurting her with criticism?\nSANDERS: Of course I'm not hurting - Well, first of all, I am running for office. She went around today, I think yesterday, today, here in Indiana suggesting that Bernie Sanders voted against the automobile bailout, happens not to be true. She has talked about me wanting to dismember healthcare programs in America when I believe in universal healthcare, that I have attacked Planned Parenthood when I want to expand funding for Planned Parenthood.\nThat's what happens in a campaign. People exaggerate and they make charges. We have tried to run an issue-oriented campaign. Why am I running for president? Not for the fun of it, you know? I'm running because I think it is too late for establishment politics and because I have strong differences of opinion with Hillary Clinton, no great secret. Hillary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq. She acknowledges that that was a mistake. I helped lead the opposition to the war in Iraq, voted against the war.\nI have voted against every one of these disastrous trade agreements which have resulted in millions of Americans losing their jobs. She has supported virtually all of them. I want to end fracking in this country, as Secretary of State she supported fracking.\nAll right, I've compared...\nJANSING: And you don't think those criticisms hurt her? I mean, you intend them to hurt her.\nSANDERS: This is - this is called a democracy. Why am I running for president? What should I do? I should be talking about what I believe and the differences of opinion that I have with Hillary Clinton. Now, if the question is, are my views much closer to Hillary Clinton's than they are to somebody like Donald Trump, of course they are.\nDonald Trump would be a disaster.\nJANSING: Now, does that mean at some point...\nSANDERS: But look...\nJANSING: Does that mean at some point that the two of you...\nSANDERS: ... this is media - this is not...\nJANSING: No, no, no, but it will - at some point, will the two of you get in a room, whoever the nominee is, do you think...\nSANDERS: Well...\nJANSING: ... and whatever the differences were...\nSANDERS: This is what I believe...\nJANSING: ... and criticisms were...\nSANDERS: This is what I believe...\nJANSING: ... you will work that through.\nSANDERS: Hillary Clinton and I, now, you have to separate the real world from media world.\nJANSING: Sure.\nSANDERS: All right, media world worries about these things, real world does not. Real world worries about how their kids are going to go to college, real world worries about climate change, real world worries about 47 million people living in poverty. That's not media world. Media world does gotcha type questions.\nNow, I will do everything that I can, and I think Hillary Clinton and I agree on this, that we will do everything we can to make sure that a Republican does not win the White House, and I will knock my brains out, I will work seven days a week to make sure that that does not happen if I am the nominee and if I am not the nominee. That's what I will do.\nJANSING: You and I in Indiana just shot some hoops. You were better at it, I think.\nSANDERS: Well, I'm a little bit taller than you.\nJANSING: All right, thank you. That's kind of you. You're a little better. So, if you were a betting man, if you were going down to the betting parlor, what are the chances Bernie Sanders is the Democratic nominee?\nSANDERS: Well you know, politics is very strange and funny things happen, and especially this political year. It's been a pretty strange year I think it's fair to say. So, if the question is, do I consider myself the underdog, you know, when we began we were 60 points behind Secretary Clinton, we have closed that gap very significantly. We have now won 17 states, think we're going to win here in Indiana.\nWe are the underdog, but I think there is a narrow path to victory and we're going to fight for every vote that we can get to make that victory happen.\nJANSING: Senator, thank you.\nSANDERS: All right.", "timestamp": "2016-04-27", "title": "Interview with Chris Jansing of NBC News"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 2:47 p.m. in the East Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John M. Richardson, USN; and Bernard Sarra, nose guard, Chris Swain, fullback, Myer Krah, outside linebacker, Troy Thompson, quarterback, and E.K. Binns, outside guard, U.S. Naval Academy Midshipmen.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117466", "text": "The President. Hello, everybody! Please have a seat. Welcome to the White House. To Coach Ken and the Navy Midshipmen, I should say welcome back. At this point, you should just add this date to your football schedule every year. [Laughter] Air Force game, Army game, bowl game, White House visit. [Laughter]\nWe do have some special guests here today that I want to acknowledge. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus is here. We've got Admiral John Richardson. We have Superintendent Ted Carter, Jr., and Athletic Director Chet Gladchuk.\nNow, Navy Football has now won the service academy rivalry 10 of the last 13 years. In that time, they've won 24 of their last 27 games against Air Force and Army. Maybe it's a good thing this trophy just stays in one place so often, because it's huge. [Laughter]\nBut I know winning the Commander in Chief Trophy means a lot to this team, and it means a lot to me because it shares its name with the most important responsibility that I have. No disrespect to Vince Lombardi or Lord Stanley, but this trophy means a little more to me personally.\nI am the eighth President to award this trophy, and this is the eighth and final time that I will do it. And what better way than by honoring this historic Navy Academy team? This squad wasn't just the best service academy on the gridiron this year, it was one of the best teams in America.\nThe team's cocaptains, Bernie Sarra and Keenan Reynolds, had a couple of mottos that I really like. The first one was \"one-and-oh,\" a reminder to take each game one at a time. So they started the season 1-0 with a 38-point blowout. They went 1-0 against Air Force in another rout. For the 14th straight year, they went 1-0 against Army to reclaim this trophy, and then Navy went 1-0 in the Military Bowl.\nAll those \"one-and-ohs\" added up to 11 wins, which is more than any Navy team in history. And Navy's been playing football a long time—about as long as we've had the lightbulb. [Laughter] For 4—in 4 years, these seniors have won more games than any Navy team since the Class of 1909. They've won this trophy three times, won three bowl games, and has anybody here ever lost to Army? [Laughter] That's sort of a deafening silence there.\nThe team's second motto that I like is something Coach Ken would remind his players at halftime: \"You don't have to do anything special, just do your job.\" \"Just do your job\"—I really like that slogan.\nIn doing their jobs, these players did something special. And that's especially true for the anchor of this Navy team, Keenan Reynolds, one of college football's alltime greats. The only quarterback in the 125-year history of the Army-Navy rivalry to win the game four times; holds 11 NCAA records, including most rushing yards by a quarterback; with his 88 touchdowns, no one in college football history has been in the end zone more times than Navy's number 19. And in honor of his leadership, both on and off the field, no one will ever wear it again, which is not bad for a guy who started out as the third-string quarterback. If you ask him which record he's most proud of, Keenan will tell you that it's the team record for wins. Of course, he'd say that. But here's how I know he means it. When Navy played Memphis in Keenan's home State of Tennessee, hundreds of his friends and relatives came out. They wanted to see him break the touchdown record. On Navy's last drive, the Mids were on the 1-yard line. Keenan was one score away. Coach called in a QB sneak, but Keenan called an audible and tossed a touchdown to running back Demond Brown. So you knew he meant it when he said that what he cared about was the team.\nNavy also dominated this year thanks to Chris Swain—or the \"Swain Train\"—[laughter]—who racked up a thousand yards. Austin Grebe, who kicked more extra points than any Midshipman in history. And the calm and quiet wrecking ball at defensive end, Will Anthony, who led the team in sacks.\nSo these players are just as impressive off the field. In February, Myer Krah went to Flint to hand out water bottles. Just last week, Myer and Troy Thompson visited with junior high students at Washington Jesuit Academy, a first-rate middle school in a low-income community here in DC.\nE.K. Binns was a finalist for \"Academic Heisman.\" Wideout Thomas Wilson is a first-team Academic All-American. But most importantly, in a few months, 17 of these seniors will be ensigns, and 15 will be commissioned second lieutenants in the Marine Corps.\nThey'll be joined in their service by another historic group of Midshipmen who are here today, and I wanted to give them a little bit of credit because we, on this day, celebrate football, but we've got a lot of extraordinary folks at the Naval Academy, and we are welcoming today the first students ever to graduate with a degree in cyber ops. And their expertise is going to be more critical than ever to our national security, so we're very, very proud of them, and we want to congratulate them.\nLook, the rivalry between our service academies can get heated. But it is healthy and rooted in respect. They learn early on what it takes to be the best. And that's what matters when you're part of the finest fighting force that the world has ever seen. As your Commander in Chief, and as one of the Americans you risk your lives to defend, I will continue to do my best to support all the men and women who have the distinction of wearing this Nation's uniform.\nFor more than a century, Navy's mascot has been a goat. After what this year's team accomplished, I think you could say that maybe that stands for \"Greatest of All Time.\" [Laughter]\nSo I want to congratulate Navy. Thank you for your service. Good luck getting this thing back to Annapolis. I don't know if you have, like, a big truck bed that you're going to be using. [Laughter] But most importantly, to all of you, I could not be prouder of your commitment and your dedication to this Nation, to our security, and to our freedom.\nGod bless you. God bless the United States of America. Let's make sure that we get a good picture here. [Laughter]\nCoach, anything you want to add here? Come on.\nHead Coach Ken Niumatalolo. Thank you. Mr. President, it's always an honor for us to come to the White House. We take great pride in the fact that we've been here pretty much for your entire Presidency. [Laughter] Thank you for your service to our country. But for me, the greatest legacy that you'll leave is that of being a father and a husband. Nobody could ever question or argue that this President loves and honors his wife and children. And so we thank you for your service to our country.\nI know there have been a lot of great sports programs that have come here to the White House, but as you said, this team is different. We have 32 seniors behind us that have volunteered to serve you, to serve our country, and we're so grateful for that. But behind you is the greatest senior class in the history of Navy football, and they are ready and willing to serve and to follow you as our Commander-in-Chief and as our head coach.\nSo thank you.

When we work to instill an appreciation for physical fitness in our people, we do more than honor an age-old tradition—we take a critical step toward ensuring the prospect of a long and healthy life. During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, we highlight the importance of staying active, and we encourage all Americans to partake in physical activity to maintain their health and well-being.\nSports and other forms of physical activity inspire us—they bridge differences, unite Americans from every walk of life, and teach the importance of teamwork. Whether exploring the great outdoors or shooting hoops with friends, regular physical activity can also relieve stress, boost energy and self-esteem, and prevent numerous chronic diseases, including some of the leading causes of death, such as cancer, stroke, and heart disease. Children should engage in physical activity for at least 1 hour each day, and adults should do so for at least 30 minutes. Critical to enabling our youth to reach their fullest potential, regular exercise must go hand-in-hand with healthy eating and proper nutrition—because our children's well-being tomorrow depends on what they eat today.\nThis year, we celebrate six decades since President Dwight Eisenhower established the President's Council on Youth Fitness, known today as the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition. The Council partners with the public, private, and non-profit sectors to empower people to lead healthy and active lives. Through their I Can Do It, You Can Do It! program, the Council facilitates physical activity for individuals with disabilities and offers opportunities for regular exercise at sites across our country. My Administration's Go4Life campaign is motivating older Americans to recommit to making exercise a part of their daily lives. And First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative continues to inspire a rising generation to eat healthily and get plenty of physical activity so they can grow up strong and pursue their dreams. For more information on my Administration's actions to promote sports and physical fitness—and for ways you can get involved—visit www.Fitness.gov and www.LetsMove.gov.\nParticipation in sports and other physical activity represents our country's promise: the idea that if you work hard, commit to a goal, and never give up on yourself, there is nothing you cannot achieve. This month, let us each strive to make fitness a greater part of our lives, and let us join together as one American team to promote physical activity and chart a healthier, fitter future for our country.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the people of the United States to make daily physical activity, sports participation, and good nutrition a priority in their lives. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-27", "title": "Proclamation 9427—National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2016"}

With faith in one another and hope for what their country could be, generations of laborers fought, sacrificed, and organized for the rights and protections that workers across our Nation have today—including requirements to protect their health and safety. Today, we honor this legacy by reflecting on those who have lost their lives in the workplace, and we reaffirm our dedication to ensuring that people can work knowing the fullest measure of stability, security, and opportunity.\nIn 1969 and 1970, two pieces of legislation of enormous consequence forever changed the lives of workers across our Nation. Passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by a Republican President, the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act—which required Federal inspections of coal mines, established processes and protections for ensuring the health and safety of coal miners, and was later amended to cover all miners—and the Occupational Safety and Health Act—which created new standards for worker protections in industries across America—represented milestone achievements for a cause borne out of decades of toil and struggle. Spurred by working men and women of every origin and background, the movement for worker safety was inspired by a simple notion: that those who contribute so much to the economy and spirit of our country should have every chance to share in its promise.\nSince I took office, my Administration has advanced protections for America's workers. In 2014, I signed an Executive Order aimed at cracking down on Federal contractors who violate our labor laws, and in the time since, we have enhanced our rigorous processes for companies contracting with the Federal Government while working to enforce and raise standards for employers throughout our economy. We have implemented rules that cut the amount of coal dust inhaled by coal miners, and we have taken steps to protect more workers from diseases caused by exposure to silica and other harmful substances. And we will enhance our efforts to support workers injured on the job, because if you are hurt at the workplace after giving your all, you should still be able to keep food on the table.\nThe history of America's workers reminds us that, far from being inevitable, the progress each generation has known has been the result of the courage, determination, and solidarity demonstrated by the last. This Workers Memorial Day, as we join in solemn remembrance of those who lost their lives undertaking their labor, let us carry forward the vision of just and safe working conditions for all of America's workers. If we stay true to that essential mission, we can deliver to our children and grandchildren a future of ever greater possibility and security.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 28, 2016, as Workers Memorial Day. I call upon all Americans to participate in ceremonies and activities in memory of those killed or injured due to unsafe working conditions.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-27", "title": "Proclamation 9430—Workers Memorial Day, 2016"}

Central to securing these ideals is ensuring that every American's fundamental, constitutionally-guaranteed individual rights are protected, and by respecting these rights, our Nation demonstrates its unwavering dedication to the law. Our fidelity to the rule of law has guided our country in times of trial and triumph, and it helps us keep faith with our Founders and with generations to come.\nOn this year's Law Day, we celebrate 50 years since the Supreme Court's ruling in Miranda v. Arizona. This landmark decision made clear that the Fifth Amendment \"...serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves.\" Miranda v. Arizona institutionalized the important practice of explaining constitutional rights prior to interrogation. And it established the important general rule that individuals interrogated in police custody cannot have their answers admitted into evidence against them unless they had first been informed of their rights—including the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney present.\nThe Court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona affirmed that \"Equal Justice Under Law\" is more than just words, but a cornerstone of our Nation's legal system—the idea that no matter who you are or where you come from, you will be treated equally and afforded due process. Today, our society faces new challenges to this age-old tenet. Our criminal justice system is in serious need of reform; disparities in stops, arrests, and sentencing persist; and in too many places distrust exists between community members and law enforcement officers. I am committed to ensuring our Nation's criminal justice system is fair, smart, and effective. By engaging people across America, my Task Force on 21st Century Policing has provided a roadmap for strengthening relationships between local police and the communities they serve, helping to uphold the integrity of our criminal justice system. My Administration has also taken action to address unfair sentencing disparities that undermine the equitable application of the law, and we will continue working to bring greater fairness to our criminal justice system and to ensure that the rule of law remains the foundation of our country.\nMiranda v. Arizona imparts an important lesson: Knowledge of our constitutional rights is an essential component to fully exercising those rights. Safeguarding the promise of equal justice requires the participation of all our citizens, and across America, community and court programs that offer civic education and prepare members of the public to fulfill their civic responsibilities are vital to this task.\nChief Justice Earl Warren, the author of the Supreme Court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona, once observed that, \"In civilized life, law floats in a sea of ethics.\" The law informs right from wrong—it affects the daily reality of our lives and safeguards the birthrights of all Americans. On Law Day, let us recommit to building a future rooted in the rule of law, in which our laws apply equally to everyone and all our children know a fair and just world. Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2016, as Law Day, U.S.A. I call upon all Americans to acknowledge the importance of our Nation's legal and judicial systems with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and to display the flag of the United States in support of this national observance.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-27", "title": "Proclamation 9428—Law Day, U.S.A., 2016"}

Driven by the determination to continue making our society more just and more equal, our work to fulfill our country's potential has always relied on our willingness to see ourselves in our fellow citizens.\nOur Nation has always been at its finest when guided by a spirit of shared sacrifice and common purpose. It is that spirit that led a small band of patriots to declare our fledgling democracy free from the grasp of tyranny, that slaves and abolitionists carried in their hearts as they marched forward on the long journey toward freedom, and that guides the men and women who wear our country's uniform in their selfless service. From the unlit paths of the Underground Railroad to the lunch counters of Greensboro, the first streets draped in the colors of pride to the highest Court in our land, we have seen throughout our history that America is inexorably driven forward by those who commit themselves to expanding our founding promise through extraordinary acts of courage and heroism. We honor that legacy—that demonstrates that the forces of hope and love of country are strong enough to overcome even our most deeply entrenched obstacles—by resolving to carry it forward, by rejecting appeals to prejudice and division in our time, and by drawing on the hopes and dreams that bind us.\nWhile ours has always been a large and complicated democracy, full of differing views and boisterous debates, our history also makes clear that we are strongest when we find in our diversity a deeper, richer unity, stemming from an overarching belief in the possibilities our shared future holds. This Loyalty Day, let us remember that what defines us as one American people is our dedication to common ideals—rather than similarities of origin or creed—and let us reaffirm that embracing this truth lies at the heart of what it means to be a citizen. As long as we stay true to that mission and uphold our responsibility to deliver a freer, fairer Nation to the next generation, a future of ever greater progress will remain within our reach.\nIn order to recognize the American spirit of loyalty and the sacrifices that so many have made for our Nation, the Congress, by Public Law 85-529 as amended, has designated May 1 of each year as \"Loyalty Day.\" On this day, let us reaffirm our allegiance to the United States of America and pay tribute to the heritage of American freedom.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2016, as Loyalty Day.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117337", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:18 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I do not have any announcements at the top so we can go straight to your questions. Kevin, would you like to start?\nQ: Sure, thank you, Josh. Can you talk a bit about the Vice President's surprise trip to Baghdad today? What message is he delivering on the President's behalf to Iraqi leaders? And what does the administration hope he'll be able to accomplish?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I think this is a good indication of the United States' continued support for Prime Minister Abadi's efforts to unify the nation of Iraq to confront ISIL. And there are two critical priorities that Prime Minister Abadi has identified.\nThe first is obviously the fight on the ground that Iraqi forces are waging against ISIL inside of Iraq. That effort on the ground is strongly supported by the United States and our coalition partners. The support that we provide comes in a variety of forms. It includes airstrikes. It includes training. It includes equipment. It includes advice and assistance from U.S. Special Operations forces.\nThe second priority that Prime Minister Abadi has identified is pursuing a set of political reforms to fight corruption. And building confidence in the ability of Iraq's central government to lead that country is critical. And the United States and our coalition partners are strongly supportive of Prime Minister's Abadi's efforts to build a government that is capable, that's honest, and that, most importantly, has the confidence of all of Iraq's diverse population.\nSo the vice presidential visit is an effort to underscore our support for Prime Minister Abadi's commitment to those priorities.\nQ: Today's GDP report indicates the economy grew by 0.5 percent the first quarter. The President has been quite vocal about how well the economy is doing. Does this report undercut those arguments? And what does he think the federal government should be doing differently to rev up the economy during the remainder of his tenure?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, the strength of the U.S. economy I think speaks for itself when you take a look at the numbers. Obviously, the numbers that we're most attuned to are the jobs numbers. And the U.S. economy is currently on the longest streak of private sector job growth in our nation's history -- 73 consecutive months, for a total of 14.4 million private sector jobs. That's a remarkable streak, and demonstrate the resilience of the U.S. economy.\nThe durability of the U.S. economy is the envy of the world. And there's no denying the important progress that we've made in digging out of the hole created by the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\nBut of course there's more that we believe should be done. The President has spent years making the case to Republicans in Congress that there is more that could be done that would strengthen our economy, expand economic opportunity for the middle class, and lay a foundation for our nation's long-term strength for the decades ahead. And that includes investments in infrastructure. The President is quoted in a story today talking about how, frankly, the United States missed an opportunity over the last couple of years to make critical investments in infrastructure while interest rates were low, while the construction sector was not as strong as it previously was.\nAnd it's unfortunate that years have gone by where that opportunity has been missed. But the President -- they weren't missed because the President wasn't encouraging Congress to take that action. Frankly, the reason that opportunity was missed was because of Republicans' stubborn refusal to consider any priority that President Obama has identified. That's unfortunate.\nAnd the President has also been a strong advocate of raising the minimum wage. That certainly would bring more fairness to our economy, particularly for hardworking Americans. At the current level of the minimum wage, the average person who's working full time being paid minimum wage and raising a family of four is doing so below the poverty line. That's not fair. It's not good for our economy. And it's inconsistent with the strategy that the President has laid out to grow our economy from the middle out.\nMaking investments in the middle class and those who are trying to get into the middle class is the surest way to have a strong economy in the United States in the near term, but also to enhance our prospects for preserving our economic strength over the long term.\nQ: So is the 0.5 percent growth something the administration feels good about?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what we feel good about are the longer-term trends as they relate to the most effective measures of our economy. And even taking a look at the most persistent components of output, which are consumption and fixed investment, those rose by 2.6 percent over the last four quarters. That an indication of a durable economy demonstrating some resilience.\nThere surely is more. We would like to see those numbers be even better. But our proposals for improving those numbers have fallen upon deaf ears when it comes to the Republicans who are in charge of Congress right now.\nQ: And are you saying that the growth rate as it stood in the first quarter is an indirect result of Republicans failing to go along with increased spending for infrastructure, minimum wage increases?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there is no denying that there are a wide variety of economic indicators that would be stronger if Republicans in Congress had seized the initiative three or four years ago and made critical investments in our infrastructure.\nAs the Vice President himself often says, we know we need it. It's not as if this would be funding that wouldn't have direct benefits for the American people. There's plenty of critical investment projects that would improve our economy and improve quality of life here in the United States. A whole host of road and bridge projects, airport upgrades, even laying new rail lines that would improve the economy and improve the quality of life in communities all across the country. So that's money that would be well spent in this projects. It also would stimulate economic growth and create jobs.\nSo I would hesitate to draw a line between one spending proposal and one economic indicator, but there's no denying that the longer-term trends would be even better than they already are if Republicans had followed the President's advice.\nFortunately, there are some things that we were able to do without strong Republican support -- things like the Recovery Act and the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reform, all of which did have positive benefits for our economy that we continue to enjoy. The vast majority -- those things were passed even though the vast majority of Republicans who were in office at the time opposed them. And we continue to look for additional ways to strengthen our economy, even in the face of unprecedented Republican obstruction in Congress.\nQ: House Speaker Paul Ryan says he's invited Prime Minister Modi to address a joint meeting of Congress on June 8th. Will the Prime Minister be coming to the White House as well?\nMR. EARNEST: The White House has been in close touch with a range of Indian officials to discuss a potential visit by Prime Minister Modi to Washington. We're still engaged in those discussions. Obviously the President has a strong working relationship with Prime Minister Modi. President Obama has complimented the important role that Prime Minister Modi played in Paris, in ensuring the successful completion of the Paris climate talks. The President had a long meeting with Prime Minister Modi in the context of that international meeting. Prime Minister Modi attended and participated in the Nuclear Security Summit that was convened here in Washington just last month. And, of course, President Obama at the beginning of last year had an opportunity to be the guest of honor at India's Republic Day celebration. That obviously was a memorable visit for the President and he was the first President to be so honored, and he accepted an invitation that had been extended by Prime Minister Modi.\nSo they obviously have a strong working relationship, and we're in conversations with them about scheduling a visit.\nTim.\nQ: There was an airstrike in Aleppo, Syria, on a hospital -- dozens of patients and doctors killed. Can you tell us anything about that, and who might have been responsible, and what it means for the pause?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, we strongly condemn the wave of airstrikes and shelling that have killed more than 60 people in Aleppo in just the last 24 hours. We're particularly appalled by an airstrike on an MSF-supported hospital in Aleppo that killed at least 14 patients and three doctors, including, reportedly, one of the last pediatricians in the city.\nThis particular airstrike on the MSF-supported facility follows multiple airstrikes over the course of this week that were reportedly carried out by the Assad regime. In particular, we saw the Assad regime carry out a strike against a Syrian civil defense station in the town of Al-Atareb in Aleppo Province. It's believed that five members of the civil defense have been killed, and many more innocent people were injured.\nThis attack fits the Assad regime's abhorrent pattern of striking first-responders. More than 100 first-responders have been killed in action, and many are killed in what are often referred to as double-tap strikes, and this is where after a strike has been carried out on a location, forces, including airplanes, will sometimes return to that location after first-responders have arrived to try to treat the injured and another strike is carried out that results in first-responders themselves being victims.\nThese tactics are abhorrent, they're immoral, but unfortunately they're entirely consistent with the actions that we've seen from the Assad regime for quite some time. This does place even more pressure on an already fragile cessation of hostilities. And it's the continued violation of that cessation of hostilities by the Assad regime and supporting forces that is also having a negative impact on the political talks.\nThe other concern that the United States and the international community continues to have is how the violations of the cessation of hostilities are affecting the ability of the international community to provide much-needed humanitarian assistance to innocent Syrians who are caught in the crossfire there. When we initially brokered the cessation of hostilities a couple of months ago, we discussed how one of the potential important benefits of implementing the cessation of hostilities was creating the space for humanitarian relief and supplies to be delivered to these communities that have been under so much pressure for years now.\nSo our concerns remain significant, and you'll recall that President Obama had an opportunity to speak with President Putin I guess a couple of weeks ago now to reinforce our view that the Russian President should use his influence with the Assad regime to encourage them to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities. And we certainly believe that there is more the Russians can do to affect that result.\nQ: Just to be clear, you're saying it's consistent with what the regime has done, so this attack was likely the regime?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, this is an attack that just occurred overnight, so I can't offer up a full assessment. But it certainly is consistent with the kinds of tactics we've seen the Assad regime use all across the country.\nQ: And the U.N. has said that if the talks deteriorate, that President Putin and Obama should intervene. Is there any move towards them talking again about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any upcoming conversations to tell you about at this point. Obviously the United States is deeply engaged in encouraging all parties to the cessation of hostilities to return to the negotiating table. And President Obama talked about this at some length with the GCC partners, GCC countries that the President met with last week in Saudi Arabia. And the United States continues to use our influence to encourage the parties to participate in the talks constructively. And we believe that there is more that the Russians can do to use their influence to convince the Assad regime to abide by the cessation of hostilities and to facilitate constructive political negotiations.\nQ: Just on the Trump speech yesterday, you don't have to watch the whole thing to determine that the allies are becoming a little bit less forthcoming with criticism of Trump. Is this a worry to the administration? As he becomes more likely to become the nominee, our allies are becoming less likely -- less vocal in criticizing him.\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't know that there are many allies that have spent a lot of time weighing in on the U.S. presidential race. I think they understand that certainly their opinion matters, but ultimately, the opinion that matters the most is that of the voters. And as I mentioned before, the voters across the country will consider the actions and policies and priorities of all of the candidates as they decide who they want to support to succeed President Obama. But, ultimately, that will be a decision for the American people to make.\nMichelle.\nQ: While the President was traveling, I mean, just on that same subject, so he's in Britain, delivering his incredibly lengthy, detailed opinion on a referendum that the British people will undertake. But when Cameron was asked directly about Donald Trump and then later Merkel was asked, they wouldn't say anything. And this was kind of in the spirit of let's all share our opinions with our allies. Is the administration disappointed that they would say nothing to weigh in on the election in that way?\nMR. EARNEST: No, not at all. I think the President answered this pretty directly when he noted that when he was traveling to London, the supporters of the Brexit campaign were describing all sorts of views to the U.S. government about how we would react to the U.K. leaving the EU. And the President felt like it was appropriate, since the critics are offering up their view about what the United States should do, it only seems appropriate that the President of the United States, while he's in the U.K., explain what the United States would do and how we would react to that particular situation.\nSo I think that is what gives the President important credibility in explaining to the British people as they consider this important decision exactly how the United States would be affected. And the President did not somehow suggest that the British people should decide based on the U.S. view. In fact, the President made clear that this is a decision that British voters should make based on their own calculations about what's in the best interest of their country. And that obvious acknowledgement -- or the acknowledgement of the obvious sovereignty of the British government and the British people is something that the President pointed out on a number of occasions.\nQ: So when world leaders weigh in on the American election, is that helpful, harmful, or neither, do you think?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think ultimately it's up to them to decide what views they want to share and what impact they expect those views will have. I think ultimately the American people will carefully consider the options they have before them and express a preference.\nQ: So if they had taken that -- in this big spirit of sharing our opinions -- if they had taken that opportunity to slam Donald Trump, which was obviously kind of the point of the question, would you have seen that as helpful? Would you have preferred that they took that opportunity?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it would have depended entirely on what they had chosen to say.\nQ: And in his interview with The New York Times, the President said that he regretted not promoting better the country's economic recovery. If it had been promoted better, what exactly would that have looked like? In what ways would that have happened? And so is the administration doing that now, and in what way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, I think what the President was referring to is something that he's observed before, which is that, in the earliest days of his presidency, the country was facing a historically dire economic environment. And there were a variety of crises that were coming to a head all at the same time. You didn't just have the financial markets spiraling out of control; you had the U.S. housing market poised to fall off a cliff. In some communities, I think it probably did; it could be described as having fallen off a cliff.\nYou had the U.S. auto industry on the verge of bankruptcy, potentially costing a million jobs, and a variety of other measures related to job creation and economic growth were all moving rapidly in the wrong direction. And the President and his team were rapidly responding to these crises and making difficult policy decisions that ultimately, seven years later, have yielded tremendous progress. At the time, there frankly wasn't the time and space to spend a whole lot of time selling publicly the wisdom of those policies. The President instead -- rather than being focused and concerned about the press coverage, 24 hours after the policy was announced -- was much more focused on the economic impact of those policies over the next several years. And by that measure, there is no denying the tremendous success of this administration in responding to the largest economic crisis in America in several generations.\nQ: So is that selling of it happening now, as we lead up to an election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't think I would describe it as selling, no. I think that there is a desire on the part of the President and the rest of the administration to help the American people understand exactly what's happened over the last six or seven years. And the reason for that is simply we've seen what works. We understand that an economic approach that focuses on expanding economic opportunity for the middle class is the best way to strengthen our economy and to ensure the strength of our economy for future generations.\nAnd the President does want to make a powerful case to the American people that the strategy and approach that he took is the right one and, frankly, is the strategy that future Presidents should follow, or at least should be the basis of their approach as well. The reason I say that is, look, the economy is a dynamic thing, so it's always going to change, and it means that different Presidents are going to face different economic challenges. But in an approach that's rooted in growing our economy from the middle out, focused on making investments in our workforce and not focused on retreating from the international community, looking for ways to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars, reduce the deficit, but also invest in infrastructure and in clean energy -- that's a smart approach and one that has laid the groundwork for a strong recovery.\nAnd it's important for people to understand the linkage between those policies and our recovery, because that's the best way for people to understand how future Presidents should approach these issues.\nQ: And just very quickly, on the Aleppo bombing, is it too early to rule out that a U.S. plane was in the vicinity yesterday as Russia is saying, or can you rule that out?\nMR. EARNEST: I'd encourage you to check with the Department of Defense on that. They can give you some updated information. I certainly have not heard anything to lend any credibility to that kind of a statement, but check with DOD.\nQ: Okay. And former Speaker Boehner is saying that Ted Cruz is \"Lucifer in the flesh.\" (Laughter.) Is that helpful, harmful? Does the President agree with that? What's your reaction to it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously Speaker Boehner was speaking based on his own experience. (Laughter.) And I'm not sure that he was trying to do -- I don't know that he was looking to be helpful or harmful; I think he was just looking to be honest about his own view.\nQ: Just being honest. But when words like that are used and phrases and descriptions are thrown out there, as they have been in this election, do you consider that crossing a line?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think if you're looking for somebody to come to the defense of one Republican who's being attacked by another, you should probably ask somebody else.\nOlivier.\nQ: I have a couple for you. One is, a doctor recently reported that CENTCOM's new report on the bombing in Kunduz is going to come out tomorrow night. Has the President been briefed on the new CENTCOM report? Has it altered his understanding of what happened in that incident?\nMR. EARNEST: Olivier, as you know, there has been a long-running investigation that was conducted by the Department of Defense I believe out of Central Command to investigate this terrible tragedy in Kunduz. I don't know at this point whether or not the President has been recently updated on that ongoing investigation, but it obviously has been going on for some time no. And when the results are made available, they'll be made available to the public by the Department of Defense. And I'm confident that the President will at least be briefed on the findings, if not actually read the report himself.\nQ: Okay. And then the second one is back in 2013 at the National Defense University, the President talked about refining and ultimately repealing the 2001 AUMF. I'm wondering, under what circumstances could that actually happen now in the remaining months that he has in office? What series of steps do you see as necessary in order to be able to do that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, this was part of the strategy that we laid out -- I guess it was at the beginning of last year -- for congressional passage of a new authorization to use military force against ISIL.\nWhat we had suggested that Congress should do is pass a new authorization to use military force that would cover our actions against ISIL. That would allow Congress to then take the step of repealing the 2002 AUMF, and further refine the 2001 AUMF in a way that would more narrowly tailor the authorization that had been given to the executive branch. So that's the approach that we took. We actually sent up legislative language that would have effected all of these changes. But the President also asked senior members of his national security team to travel up to Capitol Hill and testify under oath on camera, before Congress, to encourage them to take these steps. But unfortunately, like so many other things we think that Congress should so obviously do, Republicans have failed to act.\nQ: But just to be totally clear, unless there's a new ISIL AUMF you can't do away with 2001, right? That's your current understanding of the --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we have said, Olivier, is that the actions that the President has already ordered against ISIL -- and these are the actions that we've taken in both Iraq and in Syria -- and I believe even some of the actions that we've taken in other places, including, like, Libya -- are covered by the 2001 AUMF. The 2001 AUMF does refer to al Qaeda, and there still are places around the world where there are al Qaeda networks that -- where the United States is taking action to limit their threat to the United States.\nSo we do believe that we still need to have the authority to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and, where necessary, continue to apply pressure to al Qaeda affiliates around the globe. So we do believe that authorization is necessary. We believe that authorization could be given in a way that's much more narrowly tailored than it currently is under the 2001 authorization to use military force.\nPam.\nQ: Josh, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley was on Capitol Hill this morning testifying against bringing in Guantanamo inmates to South Carolina, saying it would harm the business climate and tourism, and make South Carolina a target for terrorists. And also, in Colorado, there was a bill defeated that would have gone on record opposing any inmates going there, but even some Democrats there don't want inmates transferred. So what are the chances that the President can follow through on his plan to close that prison?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Pam, we're going to continue to make a forceful case to Congress that the most effective way to deal with the prison at Guantanamo Bay is to seek to transfer those individuals who can be safely transferred under the right security constraints to other countries, and bring the remaining number of inmates to a secure facility in the United States where they can be prevented from harming the American people, and where, in many cases, they can be brought to justice.\nThe truth is there are dozens of dangerous, convicted terrorists who are on American soil in American prisons right now. That doesn't pose an undue threat to the American people. It doesn't make any state a target. What it does demonstrate is that the United States of America can live up to our values that we seek to advance all around the world even as we protect the American homeland. And that consistency is powerful.\nWhat's also powerful is the inconsistency of the situation at the prison at Guantanamo Bay right now. And we know that there are extremist organizations that use the continued operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting tool.\nWe also know that continuing to operate the prison at Guantanamo Bay is a waste of money. We could detain those individuals in a much more cost-effective, efficient fashion in the United States than we currently do at Guantanamo Bay. So both for reasons related to taxpayer dollars and to national security, it's not just the President who is making this argument; it's his predecessor, a Republican President made this argument. The foreign policy experts on both sides of the aisle have made this argument. Retired military leaders who devoted a significant portion of their career to keeping the American people safe agree with this argument. So we're going to continue to make our case to Congress and we're still pressing ahead because this is a top priority.\nQ: Given the fact that Congress has banned transferring prisoners back here, does the President believe he has an executive authority to somehow move them to a military base?\nMR. EARNEST: What we're focused on right now, Pam, is pursuing an option that doesn't really require a whole lot of congressional approval or coordination, it just requires Congress to get out of the way. Congress has erected barriers that have prevented the administration from taking common-sense steps that would achieve this goal, and we're just asking Congress to take them away.\nKevin.\nQ: Can I take that a step farther? What would happen, then -- were you successful in emptying the prison -- to the facility there, the land there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think at that point, you'd have to talk to the Department of Defense about how to most effectively make use of that facility. We obviously would not transfer prisoners or detainees there, but this is military land that's controlled by the United States.\nQ: And there would be no interest in ceding it back to the Cuban government?\nMR. EARNEST: No, we've ruled that out.\nQ: Okay, good. I want to ask you about home-ownership rates. They're down near a 48-year lows. Does the President view that in a positive light, insomuch as there's more stabilization, there's less risk, perhaps, in the marketplace, or is it a negative that fewer Americans are participating in the so-called American Dream of home ownership?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen those latest statistics. I can tell you that, obviously, we have seen home prices rise significantly over the last few years. That has obviously enhanced the wealth of a lot of Americans who have their household wealth tied up in the value of their home.\nQ: Or in some cases replenished the wealth that they lost.\nMR. EARNEST: That's true, in some cases, there were homeowners who saw the value of their home plunge under water, which is to say the value of their home was less than the value of their mortgage. But we have seen the housing market recover quite strongly in a number of communities across the country, and that's been a good thing. That's good for the local economy precisely because there are so many middle-class families who have their wealth tied up in their homes.\nQ: But does the President think lower home-ownership rates is, in general, a good thing, or not a good thing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously families themselves have to make these decisions. I just can't give you a specific analysis of the numbers because I haven't seen them.\nQ: Okay, cool. Puerto Rico, I want to ask you about the so-called super bailout, super Chapter 9, super bankruptcy, whatever the latest descriptor is. What is the President's plan to advance the football on this? Because the clock is ticking.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think this will give me a good opportunity to make clear it's not a bailout. So people who say that that's the case are wrong. And I suspect in many cases they have an ulterior financial motive that is not consistent with the best interest of the United States.\nThe fact of the matter is the administration put forward a very specific plan back on October 21st of last year -- 190 days ago -- laying out exactly what we believe should be done to address the situation in Puerto Rico. Again, it was not a proposed bailout, it actually was a proposal to give the Puerto Rican government exactly the same kind of restructuring authority that local cities across the country have.\nWhat it also would do, it would also bring some accountability to ensure that the Puerto Rican government was also implementing the kinds of fiscal reforms that would be taken in the context of this kind of restructuring. There are other things that would improve the economic situation in Puerto Rico that we have proposed that would have a corresponding positive impact on their fiscal situation, so we have also suggested that we should reform Puerto Rico's Medicaid program and that we should give Puerto Rico access to the earned-income tax credit. The earned-income tax credit, of course, is something that many Republicans have acknowledged can be effective in stimulating economic growth and fighting poverty. It sounds like a pretty good recipe for addressing the tough situation in Puerto Rico.\nLook, we're talking about 3 million Americans that live in Puerto Rico, and right now you've got Republicans who have essentially turned a blind eye to their plight. And the longer that Republicans put off finding this solution, the more likely it becomes that they'll have to resort to a bailout. Those are just the facts. And that's why the administration continues to make a strong case that Congress should act now. In fact, they should have acted months ago to address this situation so that Puerto Rico could get their finances under control, so that we could make sure that the situation in Puerto Rico doesn't deteriorate even further.\nHere's one other thing that we know, just to make this even more complicated. We know that there are a lot of Americans who travel regularly to Puerto Rico because they have family there or they're going to vacation there, and we know that the Zika virus is in Puerto Rico. And because of the fiscal challenges that the government is having there, that it's having a negative impact on the public health system in Puerto Rico.\nSo we need to address this -- there are a variety of reasons that we need to address this situation, and the problem only gets worse as Republicans in Congress drag their feet.\nQ: Is the President in conversation with Speaker Ryan, for example, on this?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any recent presidential-level conversations to tell you about. But the White House has been in touch with, on a regular basis over the last 190 days, with members of Congress in both parties to try to advance a solution here.\nQ: Just a couple more. On the Vice President's trip to Iraq, this follows visit by your Defense Secretary, your Secretary of State, as well. I think there might be some who would look at that and say, well, it must be pretty bad if all these high-level people are going over there. How concerned is the President at the deterioration of Iraq? Or am I over-reading that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, you heard the President in Riyadh talk about his concern about the tough political situation inside of Iraq right now. The good news is, just in the last 24 or 36 hours, we did see the Iraqi parliament move to confirm a majority of appointees that Prime Minister Abadi had made to his cabinet. That's good news. And that is sort of a welcome -- that's welcome progress when it comes to pursuing the kinds of political reforms that Prime Minister Abadi has identified as critical to effectively governing the country.\nWhat's also true, Kevin, is we've also seen some important progress over the last several months in rolling back ISIL from territory in Iraq that they previously controlled. And that progress was the result of intensive coordination between Iraqi forces and coalition forces. And the President has rolled out some ideas in just the last couple of weeks about how to further intensify that coordination and that cooperation. And that President is hopeful that Iraqi forces will continue to make progress in laying the groundwork to eventually drive ISIL out of the second-largest city in Iraq.\nQ: Last one. What does the President believe about this idea of the bison becoming the de facto mammal of the United States of America? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen some of the reporting on this, but I have not seen --\nQ: (Inaudible) Buffalo -- this is important to me.\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, I can imagine that that would be the case. But I haven't heard the President weigh in with a view. But maybe somebody will have an opportunity to ask him at some point.\nJohn.\nQ: The House Armed Services Committee voted yesterday to approve an amendment -- a very tight vote, 32-30 -- that would require women to register for the selective service. Does the Commander-in-Chief believe that he would sign that legislation if it reaches his desk?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, that's a good question. Obviously this is an issue that is going to attract a lot of attention, and understandably so. There's not much that I can say about it, however, because this is the subject of some ongoing litigation. You've seen recent announcements from the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, that would give more women who are in the military the opportunity to defend their country in more roles. And the President obviously has welcomed that progress. He certainly believes that makes our fighting forces even stronger.\nAnd the other thing that we know to be true is that men and women have served in our all-volunteer force, in both Iraq and in Afghanistan, with distinction and with courage and with bravery. And it's because of their service and their sacrifice -- both men and women -- that we're safer, and that we enjoy so many of the freedoms that are easy to take for granted. The President certainly does not take them for granted. And the President has often talked about how serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the United States military is the greatest honor. And that certainly is true because of the service and sacrifice that American men and women have made in our military.\nQ: Has it given him any pause to think that perhaps his daughters would have to sign up for selective service?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, at this point I can't weigh in on the specific proposal just because it is a subject of litigation.\nQ: More generally then, Charlie Rangel, pretty much every year that he's been in Congress, has called to reinstitute the draft vote. Does the President support that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't heard the President articulate his support for that. Obviously, we do have a system. Currently, the U.S. military functions at a high level, even though it is an all-volunteer force. And like I said, the President is quite proud of the service and bravery and professionalism of our all-volunteer force. And even in some very difficult situations, men and women of the United States military have demonstrated their mettle. But at this point, I have not heard the President express support for that proposal.\nQ: And then a small follow-up on the 2001 AUMF. We talked about the authority to fight al Qaeda wherever it may be, whether it's Libya or Afghanistan.\nMR. EARNEST: Yemen.\nQ: Yemen. What about Bangladesh? There was that horrific killing over the last weekend that we spoke about a few days ago. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for that. Does the President feel that he's got the authority to go there and maybe approve an airstrike or something?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously I'm not going to talk about any operations that may be contemplated by the President or his national security team. I can just tell you that the President takes very seriously the responsibility that he has as the Commander-in-Chief to order the United States military to take action and protect the American people. And the President has not hesitated to do that.\nThere are a variety of circumstances in a variety of countries where he has asked our men and women to go into harm's way to protect us. And we're coming up on the fifth anniversary of the President ordering the operation to take Osama bin Laden off the battlefield. Obviously, that mission was successful, again, because of the courage and bravery and enormous skill of our men and women in uniform.\nAnd the President won't hesitate. And I think that's as clear an example as you could ask for of the President not hesitating to take the steps that he believes are necessary as Commander-in-Chief to protect the American people.\nTara.\nQ: I have a question about Aleppo. You talked about what the Russians can do or should be doing. And in the past, U.S. officials have talked about the presence of al-Nusra Front, and about how Russians have gone after them. And since they fall outside of the ceasefire, it makes the situation more complicated. So I'm wondering what message the U.S. is sending to Russians in terms of the bombings and what should be done.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the message that we're sending to the Russians is a direct one, and that is that they need to abide by the cessation of hostilities that they signed onto, and they need to use their influence with the Assad regime to do the same.\nThe United States has certainly fulfilled our commitment to doing that, both in terms of our own actions, but also in terms of using our leverage with other parties to abide by the cessation of hostilities. The reason that we have done that is because it is critical for these political talks to progress. And one of the goals of the cessation of hostilities was to reduce the violence so that the political conversations could move forward. And we have seen the political talks waver because a cessation of hostilities has been increasingly fragile.\nSo we continue to be quite concerned about the situation, and we continue to impress upon the Russians the priority that we believe they should place on the successful implementation of the cessation of hostilities.\nLet me also say that we acknowledge that the situation on the ground in Syria is chaotic. It's complicated. And there are situations where there are forces like Nusra who are not part of the cessation of hostilities where their forces get comingled with forces that are part of the cessation of hostilities.\nSo that is what is going to prevent the clean implementation of the cessation of hostilities. We acknowledge that there are going to be some complications. And even in the run-up to the implementation of the cessation of hostilities, we acknowledged that there would be some bumps in the road. We acknowledged that there were likely to be some violations. We acknowledged there would likely be some ambiguity. In fact, the cessation includes a mechanism for evaluating potential violations to try to remove the ambiguity of the situation and get to the bottom of what exactly is happening.\nSo as with everything in Syria, it's complicated. But what's not complicated is the way that the United States has prioritized the successful implementation of the cessation of hostilities. And what's not complicated is the message that we have delivered to the Russians that they should use their influence with the Assad regime and communicate the same message.\nChristi.\nQ: Thanks, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Looks like you have some help today. (Laughter.)\nQ: I do. It's \"Take Your Reporter To Work Day,\" or \"Child Reporter To Work Day.\"\nMR. EARNEST: Excellent.\nQ: She has a burning question for you about equal pay in soccer. (Laughter.) You can think about that for a minute.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I think the President has spoken pretty powerfully today.\nQ: He did. He sounded like he was kind of outraged on behalf of the women.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: All right. A quick follow-up on the draft. You said the President hasn't expressed support, but has he ruled it out? You sounded a little more open to it than I expected.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I just meant to convey that I haven't heard him weigh in publicly on this. And so I think -- I was just trying answer the question in the spirit in which John offered it, which was does the President support it, and I haven't heard him say that he supports it. But I'm not trying to signal any new openness to a proposal like that.\nQ: Okay. On the accidental bombing at the MSF hospital in Afghanistan, would the President be satisfied to learn that that had resulted only in one suspension and a few reprimands by letter? Would that send a strong enough message about how seriously the U.S. takes this incident?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Christi, I'm not going to prejudge the outcome at this point. There obviously is an independent investigation that's been conducted. And over the last several months that this investigation has been conducted, we've gone to great lengths to try to protect the independence of the investigation.\nSo I'm reluctant to comment in much detail on it until the results have been produced. But the President was direct in the immediate aftermath of this incident that accountability is important. And that is something that was communicated to the military leadership, and they have undertaken this independent investigation because they recognize that accountability is important as well. But I'm not going to prejudge the outcome of the investigation at this point.\nQ: Many international aid organizations had specifically asked that criminal charges be seriously considered. Do you know if the President specifically asked the Pentagon to look at that?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has also respected the independent nature of the investigation and has not insisted upon one course or the other when it comes to conducting the investigation.\nQ: But the President hasn't been informed of an outcome, is that right?\nMR. EARNEST: That's my understanding. I'm certainly not aware that he has been at this point.\nRon.\nQ: Just on that issue, the main concern of MSF when that happened was that they alleged it was a war crime, specifically a war crime. Is that claim going to be addressed, do you think?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know what will be included in the findings of the report. But once a report has been issued, I know that the Department of Defense is planning to make as much of that report public as they can. And so we'll have an opportunity to evaluate what they considered.\nQ: And again, do you know specifically if the issue of a war crime was communicated to the military by the President or anybody else as a matter of investigation? I guess the question essentially -- was it taken that seriously by the Pentagon whether or not a war crime was committed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I know is that this is an investigation that the Department of Defense did take very seriously. And I know the President is interested in understanding the results of the investigation. But in terms of how the investigation was conducted, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense. And I suspect it will be a little easier for them to have that conversation with you once a report has been issued.\nQ: So one thing. Tomorrow there's a smart gun technology issue, there's a proposal. There's what exactly tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously we'll have more that we can talk about tomorrow. The President announced earlier this year a whole set of executive actions to try to make our communities safer from gun violence. And under discussion was exploring what kind of technology could be effectively used to make guns safer. And so this is something that a variety of federal agencies have reviewed, and they'll have some findings to share.\nQ: So this is going to be a report of findings, not necessarily an administrative requirement to do something, or an order?\nMR. EARNEST: Once we've made an announcement, we can evaluate exactly what the request is.\nQ: Is there anything else from the gun smart -- the common-sense, as you call it, gun control front that we can expect any time soon?\nMR. EARNEST: Nothing that I have to give you a head's up on right now.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Congress is about to take a week recess, and there's been little process on the Zika funding supplemental. Is there a particular timeline? Do you have to have a certain amount of funding by a certain time?\nMR. EARNEST: Cheryl, the thing that we know is that as we get closer to the summer, the risk from the Zika virus only increases. And it's a shame that Republicans in Congress have refused to move the ball forward in giving our public health professionals the resources that they need to protect the American people from Zika. This is a public health emergency -- that's what our public health experts have told us. They don't have a political agenda; they're just trying to keep people safe and healthy. And for some reason, that doesn't appear to be high on the agenda of congressional Republicans. If it were, this is the kind of supplemental funding package that should be able to pass pretty quickly.\nLet me give you a -- there's a relevant example that I would cite for you. In 2009, there were significant concerns about an H1-N1 flu pandemic having a significant impact on the United States. When Democrats were in charge of the Congress, they acted rather quickly to appropriate more than $7 billion to ensure that the country could prepare for that kind of pandemic. I would point out that this was something that was referred to as a no-year spending request that we put forward; there were not constraints about which fiscal year it would apply to.\nAnd I know this is just the latest excuse that we've heard from Republicans about why they haven't acted. They've suggested that they need a more detailed breakdown of which fiscal year the funding would be used. The truth is, we can't fund the fight against Zika a few months at a time. In order to effectively, for example, develop and test and manufacture a vaccine that can be used to protect more than 300 million American citizens, that's a multiyear effort that we're talking about. And that's an undertaking that the private sector will have to commit to.\nSo if we're going to ask the private sector to commit to a multiyear effort to develop a vaccine, then Congress needs to make a commitment to a multiyear effort to fund it. That's the way that we're going to protect the American people, and there's no reason that this should get bogged down in the kind of political gamesmanship that Republicans, for some reason, seem to delight in, even in the face of a public health emergency.\nQ: I'm just wondering if there's any sort of deadline.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think in many ways you could say that the deadline for this funding has passed, because you had the director of the National Institutes of Health standing at this podium three weeks ago, saying that he didn't have all of the resources that he felt like he needed to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus. So I think by that standard, which is an entirely reasonable one, Republicans have missed the deadline, and that puts the American people at risk. And I don't know how they're going to explain it when they go on recess next week.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, yesterday the governor of Tennessee signed into law a bill that would allow therapists to deny services based on s sincerely held belief that seemed to enable LGBT discrimination in the name of religious freedom. You've spoken out against measures like this before. Do you have a reaction to this one?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the details of this particular piece of legislation. I can just tell you as a general matter, Chris, as you've heard me say on a number of occasions in the last few weeks, the administration believes strongly in fairness, in equality, and justice. And we believe in bills that promote fairness, equality, and justice, and we are strongly opposed to any legislative effort to undermine protections for any American. And I will acknowledge I'm not familiar with the intricacies of this particular legislation, but that principle is one that the President believes strongly in. And it's not just the way he evaluates federal measures, but when we choose to weigh in on state and local matters, it's an important criteria.\nQ: Coming off of the President's trip overseas last week, do these laws seem to enable anti-LGBT discrimination in these states? Have they undermined U.S. efforts -- U.S. advocacy for LGBT and human rights overseas in places like Saudi Arabia?\nMR. EARNEST: Not when it comes to the President. The President continues to be a forceful advocate for human rights everywhere he goes. He views that as part of the job description. And he also has his own personal conviction about a lot of these issues, and he's eager to use the platform of the presidency of the United States to try to influence other countries and to persuade them that respect for basic, universal human rights should be a priority. And he certainly did make that case when he was in Saudi Arabia, and not for the first time, I would point out.\nQ: Well, I just bring that up because during the news conference in London, the President was asked to address the North Carolina and Mississippi laws, in response to the travel advisory that Britain has placed on North Carolina and Mississippi as a result of those laws. And I'm just wondering, in addition to that news conference, did these laws come up privately at all with discussions with any of the leaders overseas?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of.\nQ: And finally, are having these laws in place undermining efforts at the domestic level, at the federal level to further advance LGBT rights such as lifting the ban on transgender military service?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware of any impact that these state laws have had on those policies. So, no, I'm not aware of any impact it had.\nQ: And just to be clear, you're not aware of any obstacles stopping, blocking the change at the Pentagon to allow transgender military service, other than the process itself at the Pentagon?\nMR. EARNEST: That's right. There is this ongoing process, and I'm not aware that the state law -- that any state law that's been passed has had any impact on it.\nFrancesca. Nice to see you.\nQ: Nice to see you as well. It's the White House Correspondents Dinner this weekend. It's the President's last one.\nMR. EARNEST: So I've heard. (Laughter.)\nQ: Yes, so you've heard. It's amazing how many people are in town all of a sudden. And it's the President's last one. And last year, at the dinner, he came up with a bucket list. And I was wondering how you think that the President is doing on that bucket list -- and if you'd like, I can remind you of some of the things that were on it -- but also, what he might plan to add to that in his final year.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has certainly enjoyed taking things off his bucket list. I'm not aware of any recent additions to that list, but we're always open to suggestions. So if you have any suggestions, send them my way. I'll make sure that they get into the proper hands.\nQ: I'll come prepared tomorrow.\nMR. EARNEST: There you go. But look, the President is looking forward to the dinner. He always enjoys the opportunity to spend some time delivering a light-hearted speech for a change. And I know he's looking forward to Saturday.\nQ: Can you give us a preview? Any jokes?\nMR. EARNEST: Not at this point. That would spoil the surprise.\nMike.\nQ: On the Aleppo situation, as you noted, this hospital bombing, the latest atrocity committed apparently by the Assad regime, killed the last pediatrician or one of the last pediatricians in Aleppo. It sort of raises the question, once again, under what circumstances would the administration respond against the Assad regime for civilian casualties? Syrian civilian casualties? This is not like the U.S. bombing of the hospital in Kabul. There's a long history of the Assad regime not only disregarding civilian safety, but directly targeting civilians. So it's not like this might be a one-time accident. Under what circumstances would the U.S. consider making some sort of military response to a civilian atrocity committed by the Assad regime? And are you developing options along those lines?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of consideration of any military response at this point as a result of this particular incident. I do think it underscores what you are noting, which is that the Assad regime, tragically, has a long history of using that country's military might to attack innocent civilians. And it's why we have made a strong case that President Assad has lost the legitimacy to lead that country. How could you possibly lead and unite a country whose citizens you've spent the better part of five years attacking?\nSo this actually reflects the failure of President Assad's political leadership, because he's had to resort to using the military might of the country to attack his own constituents. So that's why we've made a strong case that President Assad needs to go, and Syrian leadership that actually reflects the will of the Syrian people with the capacity to actually unite the country to face down the threat that is posed by ISIL -- that's what's required. And that's what we are trying to bring about.\nBut the process has been difficult, in part because we have seen countries like Russia that have made a tragic decision to prop him up. And that has prolonged this conflict. And we have -- that's why we have continued to urge the Russians to pursue a different approach and to try to persuade the Assad regime to, first of all, live up to the cessation of hostilities and stop targeting innocent people, but second of all, engage in the kind of political talks that are necessary to resolve the political turmoil inside of Syria. And that's the only way we're going to be able to get at the root of all that plagues Syria and all of the consequences that has yielded.\nQ: Are there atrocities against civilians that would cause us to intervene against the Assad regime directly?\nMR. EARNEST: It's hard to entertain a hypothetical like that. But our profound concern about the humanitarian situation inside of Syria is well documented. And that's why the United States has been the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance. Because of assistance provided by the United States, some humanitarian relief has been provided to people in Syria who need it.\nIt's why the United States has been a strong advocate of the U.N.-facilitated political talks to try to bring about the kind of political solution that would bring an end to the violence inside of Syria. It's why we have regularly been in touch with the Russians to encourage them to use their influence with the Assad regime to live up to the cessation of hostilities and engage in the political talks.\nSo the United States has been at the forefront of this effort to bring an end to the violence for years. But what's happening in Syria is a genuine tragedy, and millions of lives have been affected. And the United States is well aware of that, and is playing a leading role in trying to resolve the situation.\nGoyal, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you. Two questions. One, let me go back to Prime Minister Modi's visit to the White House. So much has been going on and happening between the two countries, U.S. and India, so many high-level visits, including the finance minister of India met with the Secretary of Treasury. And also, yesterday, foreign secretary of India met with the National Security Advisor, Madam Rice. Did that meeting include the state visit of Prime Minister Modi to the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have been in discussions with our Indian counterparts about a potential visit of Prime Minister Modi to Washington. Those discussions continue. I don't have any updates on them at this point. But obviously the President values the working relationship he has with Prime Minister Modi, and I wouldn't rule out a potential visit.\nQ: And last time, when the President visited India, his goal to visit Agra, Taj Mahal. The people of Agra are still waiting for his visit, that if he's going to take the First Family to the Taj Mahal that he couldn't make last time because of Saudi King's death.\nMR. EARNEST: The President was quite disappointed to not have an opportunity to visit the Taj Mahal on his last visit to India. As you point out, that had originally been part of the itinerary, but the President had to cut short his visit to India because of the untimely death of the King of Saudi Arabia. So the President traveled to Saudi Arabia to pay his respects at that point.\nI wish I could promise -- I think the President wishes I could promise that he would have an opportunity to visit Taj Mahal before the end of his presidency, but I'm not sure that will happen.\nQ: And second, last week at the Council on Foreign Affairs, they had a summit -- held a summit on diversity. And that was diverse panel and diverse audience, and it was by the George Washington University's Elliott School. My question is, here -- that they had all these questions that -- how President Obama will put this diversity, because this is the most diverse administration and diverse President. After he leaves office, what is the future of diversity in America?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I will just say that one of the priorities that the President has identified for staffing the U.S. government is to do more to make sure that we have a government that reflects the diversity of our country. And by and large, the administration has been quite successful in that effort. And the President is proud of that record, both because of the way it reflects the diversity of our country right now, but in some ways it's even more important that the pipeline for talent has also been now diversified; that so often, as people get promoted or considered for higher-level openings, there's careful consideration of their experience. I think that's certainly an understandable thing for an employer to do.\nNow you have a much more diversified workforce that has a much more diversified set of experiences. And that's a good thing. And that means that our government has been diverse over the last eight years, but it means that our government is more likely to be diverse at higher levels for the next generation because of those steps.\nAnd the President would certainly be pleased if part of his legacy is that the higher levels of the U.S. government are more diverse 10, 15, 20 years from now because of important early hiring decisions that were made during his presidency.\nQ: By the way, the Prime Minister Modi has a very high level of this administration of the President.\nMR. EARNEST: The President certainly welcomes that affection.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:26 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-04-28", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117339", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n3:22 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. It's nice to see you all. Welcome to the White House. And welcome to the White House Briefing Room. This is obviously the room where, every day, or almost every day, I come and do a briefing with the White House Press Corps. So these are journalists who have devoted a significant portion of their lives to covering the White House very closely.\nAnd we often talk about how this is the venue where independent, professional journalists ask tough questions. And this is where the President of the United States sends a senior member of his staff to come out and answer those questions. People can ask whatever they want, and the whole thing takes place on the record, for everybody to see, on camera. And it is an important part of our democracy, and I'm glad that we'll be able to do it in a way that all of you can participate in at least this unique way.\nSo with that, I'm mostly interested in answering the questions that you're interested in talking about. So let's move around. So yes, this young lady in the back, I'll let you go first.\nQ: I was wondering if you think there's a problem with the way that the media actually reports negatively on the gun control issues. And maybe there's not enough positive influence -- or positive press of how it has helped -- the Second Amendment right has helped in certain situations.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this question about public perception of gun safety policy is an important one. Public polls indicate that a strong majority of Americans across the country support common-sense gun safety legislation. And that's not just Democrats who strongly support it. We know that many of those polls indicate that a strong majority of Republicans support common-sense gun safety legislation. There are a number of other polls that indicate a majority of gun owners support common-sense gun safety legislation.\nSo it does raise some questions about what's going on here. And the President has made the point that there's no shortage of attention that's devoted to gun violence.\nNow, there are frequently, tragically, high-profile shootings that happen all too frequently. There are also shootings that happen particularly in urban communities that happen every day that don't get any attention. And I think it is hard to assess exactly what impact all of that has on public opinion.\nBut what the President has observed is, in some ways this isn't a question about public opinion, it's a question about broken politics. Because all of the evidence indicates that a majority of the American public supports common-sense gun safety legislation that would make it harder for people who shouldn't have guns from getting them -- criminals, people with mental problems.\nAnd there are laws that we can pass that don't infringe on the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans, but could take some steps that would make it harder for people who shouldn't get a gun from getting one. And that's not going to prevent every incident of gun violence; there are people who are still going to be killed because of guns.\nBut if we can do something to make the country just a little bit safer, to prevent even one incident of gun violence, then why wouldn't we take that action, particularly if we know it wouldn't undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans?\nAnd the way that the President has answered this question is, we're only going to be able to pass those policies through Congress once enough people come forward and say, you know what, I'm going to be a single-issue voter -- Democrat or Republican; I'm only going to support somebody who supports and vows to make a priority out of common-sense gun safety legislation.\nAnd the President has taken that approach himself. And he has said that he won't raise money or articulate his support for someone who doesn't support that kind of common-sense approach. And he hopes a lot of other Americans will take the same approach.\nThis gentleman right here.\nQ: I was just wondering where the President's daughter will be going to college. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: That is a pertinent question these days. Obviously, the decision deadline is coming soon. We have worked to assiduously protect the privacy of the President's two daughters. And they're private citizens who obviously occupy a fairly prominent role in public life. And fortunately, much of the mainstream media has been very respectful of understanding that these are two girls -- they didn't run for office, they didn't ask for all this attention. But the attention that is directed their way is understandable.\nAnd I would anticipate that we'll have an announcement about her choice at some point soon. We're going to do it in a way so that nobody gets scooped. We're not going to leak it to somebody. So all of the reporters that are eager to get that scoop can just relax and know that we'll be making an announcement at an appropriate time.\nThanks for the good question. Yes, ma'am.\nQ: We talked a lot about student loan debt today, and one of the questions that I didn't hear much talk about is admission cost for public college, and I think that's one of the main issues for me personally. I do have student loans and things like that, but the initial cost is the problem that I see. What is the federal government doing to lower public college costs so that people can afford and not have to go into debt and take out student loans in order to go to college and pursue a higher education?\nMR. EARNEST: This is an excellent question. You have pressure on both sides, right? We want to exert upward pressure on the ability of students to afford to pay for college, but we also want to apply some downward pressure on the cost of college to make it a little easier for everybody to afford. That's going to save taxpayers money, but it also is going to save students money as well.\nAnd we spend a lot of time talking about what the President has done to make a college education more affordable and more available to middle-class families and middle-class students. So you've heard us talk about the Pell grant program and how we've significantly expanded the Pell grant program. The President fought hard for something called the American Opportunity tax credit that offers a tax credit to middle-class families who are paying college tuition. The President recently succeeded in making that tax credit permanent; we are obviously quite pleased about that.\nBut on the other side of the ledger, we have been looking for creative ways to try to apply some downward pressure to college costs. And there have been a range of policies that have been considered as it relates to tying federal funding for colleges and universities to their ability to keep college costs low.\nNow, this is a little bit of a controversial notion, and let me explain to you why. Too many state governments, in their zeal to cut government spending, are reducing their support for public colleges and universities. That's a bad thing. That is a really poor choice. It's a short-sighted decision to make -- to cut an investment in something that's going to be critical to the long-term success of your state.\nAnd what many college administrators legitimately say is, look, I'm getting less support from the state government, and if I want to continue to provide a high-quality education to the student body, I've got to get that money from somewhere.\nSo part of the responsibility certainly does lie at the state level, and making sure that states continue to understand that they have a responsibility to invest in the quality of an education that's being offered at state-run institutions.\nThis gentleman in the back. Yes, you. (Laughter.)\nQ: At Truman State University, it takes approximately two to three weeks for a student to get their first meeting with a mental health counselor, and that's not even before the heavy, like, midterms and finals times. So what is the administration doing to support mental health on American college campuses?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Dan, the President has actually done more than any other President to expand access to mental health care all across the country. This was, of course, included in Obamacare. The President made mental health care a priority by ensuring parity between medical care that people had access to but also mental health care as well. There also was extensive funding that was included in the Affordable Care Act for community health centers that often are a facility that can provide mental health care services.\nOf course, the Affordable Care Act also expanded Medicaid coverage, which meant more people had access to the kind of health care, including mental health care, that they need. So this administration has certainly been at the forefront of trying to expand access to quality mental health care for people all across the country.\nI think the question that you're asking is also not totally unrelated to the question that was just asked -- that as state-run institutions are facing tighter budgets, and as they see state governments reduce the level of support they're providing state institutions, it means that some state schools are having to make cutbacks. And unfortunately, that means making cutbacks in areas that are critical to the health and wellbeing of the student body. And I think you identified one area.\nSo this administration is certainly going to continue to look for ways to expand mental health care coverage. We're going to look for ways to provide additional support to colleges and universities that's using that money in the right way, and we're going to continue to encourage states to do the right thing.\nYes, this young lady in the front.\nQ: Today we talked a lot about sexual assault on college campuses, which has become an epidemic in recent years. There's some controversy around the fact that universities often regulate their own sexual assault cases. So with that in mind, do you think that the federal government should provide more oversight in the regulation of sexual assault cases on college campuses?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President certainly does believe that ending sexual assault on college campuses should be a top priority -- not just of state and local governments but also of higher education officials. Colleges and universities, and the administrators who are responsible for running them, have to take responsibility for addressing this problem. And this is a problem that is pervasive on college campuses.\nAnd we have seen, particularly in recent years, students become more aware of a need to make solving this problem a priority. And I think it is fair to say that on too many college campuses, administrators have been a little late to the game. And there is some more work that I think can be done, as a policy matter, to try to ensure that these situations are resolved fairly and consistent with the law, to make sure that the rights of everybody involved are properly protected and accounted for.\nBut I think this also is the kind of situation that shouldn't just rely on government to solve; that, ultimately, students need to take some responsibility for the kind of campus climate that exists in their community. This is why the President has been a leading advocate of something called the It's On Us campaign. The It's On Us campaign essentially is where men and women take responsibility for intervening in situations that could potentially lead to sexual abuse or sexual assault. And it requires some social courage to step up and intervene in a situation where you might be concerned about the safety of somebody involved. And there's a natural human tendency to think to yourself, well, that looks like a messy situation, I don't want to get involved, particularly when it might be a situation where alcohol or drugs could be involved.\nBut the truth is we all need to hold ourselves accountable, not just for making sure that we are treating each other with respect, but also making sure that we're going to take responsibility for the climate and the culture on our campus, and that if we see something wrong we're not going to hesitate to stand up and speak out and make sure that everybody that's in our community is safe.\nSo we've encouraged people to go to ItsOnUs.org and to take the pledge. I've done that, and the President and the Vice President have done that. And we are hopeful that that kind of engagement, people taking that pledge, will lead to the kind of change on college campuses across the country that we'd like to see and that will ultimately make more college students safe.\nThis gentleman right here.\nQ: Could your administration discuss a bit on recent calls in the election cycle, especially from the Democratic side, over making college more affordable, as in free, just like most Western European nations? We just were speaking with the Secretary of Education John King, and I kind of found it ironic that the Secretary of Education for the richest country in the history of the world is still paying his graduate student debt. So could you comment on maybe making -- on the comments that, you know, the presidential candidates are saying?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just talk to you about what the administration has done. So obviously, as I mentioned earlier, we've been very focused on looking for ways that we can expand the assistance that we provide to middle-class students and students that are trying to get into the middle class. We've also been looking for ways that we can expand assistance to families who are paying for their child to get a college education. And we've been looking for creative policy ways that we can put downward pressure on college costs, and making clear to college administrators that they have a responsibility to try to keep a limit on the growth in education costs.\nWe've also been encouraging of state governments, that they need to look for ways to at least protect the amount of support that they provide to state-run colleges and universities, if not expand that support.\nThe other thing that the President called for in his State of the Union address last year in early 2015 -- the President put forward a specific idea that actually is already being implemented in a handful of states, including the state of Tennessee, and that is to offer a free community college education to every student that's willing to work for it.\nAnd the idea here is that if you can offer up a free community college education to hardworking students that are getting good grades and doing their homework and continuing to maintain a workload, that you can essentially cut the cost of a four-year education in half. The first two years at a community college they could get for free. And that would make a tangible impact on the ability of students who are trying to prepare themselves for a 21st century global economy.\nIt also would have an impact on I think what are often called nontraditional college students -- that you have people who have started out their career in one field and either they lose their job or they recognize they want to change to a different field, but they can't move to that new job until they get some additional training.\nSo giving more workers the opportunity to go to community college for a couple of years, have that paid for by the federal government, and then come out with enhanced skills that would allow them to make an even better contribution to the local economy -- that's a win-win. And this is what they've done in the state of Tennessee, and it's been very beneficial to the state. They've seen an economic benefit associated with a better-educated workforce.\nSo the President has proposed, look, if there's a Republican governor in the state of Tennessee who can make this program work in his state, why shouldn't Democrats and Republicans work together in Washington to give that opportunity to every American? And unfortunately, Republicans have been resistant to this idea, even -- these are Republicans in Congress that have been resistant to this idea even though Republicans in Tennessee have seen firsthand that it works great.\nSo the President is going to continue to advocate for this kind of reform, and is hopeful that we can build some momentum, such that maybe the next Congress will be more willing to take it up than this one has been.\nYes, this young lady right there.\nQ: The role of the press secretary is to be an honest broker between the administration and the press. How do you balance making the President look good with honestly communicating all sides of the policies that the administration is doing? And also, how do you think journalists can improve their coverage of government affairs?\nMR. EARNEST: That is a good question. (Laughter.) How long do you have? (Laughter.) I have worked to conspicuously avoid playing media critic in this role. It might affect my ability to be an honest broker if I spent a lot of time critiquing the performance of the independent press corps. So I think I'm going to dodge your second question, but let me see if I can give you a thoughtful answer to your first one.\nThe basic function of the press secretary is to help the American people understand what the President is doing and why he's doing it. In some ways, that is the basic function of the job. Reporters have a similar mandate -- that they want to give their readers or their viewers or their listeners greater insight into what it is the President is doing, and try to help their readers or listeners understand why he's doing it.\nSo the approach that I have taken is to try to learn those facts for myself -- to not just understand sort of the basic talking points, but to actually try to delve into the policy and understand why particular decisions have been made, either by the President or by other senior decision-makers in his administration -- and then to also try to put those decisions into context, to help people understand the President's approach to problem-solving or the President's approach to a whole set of issues so that they can understand why a particular decision was made.\nAs people sort of assess the relationship between the White House Press Corps and the White House Press Office, the thing that I often remind journalists who occasionally will decide to write about this issue is that there's supposed to be some tension between the White House Press Office and the White House Press Corps. If there wasn't, it would be a pretty good indication that somebody wasn't doing their job. If there's ever a day that one of the professionals in the White House Press Corps walks into my office and says, you know, you guys have been totally transparent today, you've answered all of my questions, you've given me access to all the information that I need, thanks a lot, I have no complaints -- they're not doing their job.\nEven if we have been extraordinarily transparent -- which we have been -- (laughter) -- it's incumbent upon those journalists to say, you should give us more. That's their job. And it's my job to try to be as accommodating as I can, while at the same time protecting the President's ability to make a decision, but also making sure that the context of that decision is not lost.\nSo that's why reporters who are interested in having a positive working relationship with the White House -- my expectation for them is not that they're going to write stories that are good for the White House every day, that make the President look good or make the White House look good or make the administration look good. Sometimes there are tough stories. And when you consider some of the more complicated questions that this administration has had to deal with, it's plausible that people are going to read stories that don't make the President or the administration or the White House look good.\nThe situation in Syria right now is tragic. There are millions of innocent people who have been displaced from their homes. And the administration and the President has put forward a bold strategy that exceeded the original expectations that people had for what we'd be able to do to influence this situation, but so far, it continues to be the case that there are innocent people dying in Syria.\nAnd so many stories that are written about Syria don't make the President look good. But what I challenge reporters to do is, even if we accept the situation in Syria is bad, and it's a situation that the White House and the President has not solved, despite how hard he's worked to try, what I do want people to understand is why is this situation so complicated, what is it that the President has tried to do, and why is it that he's tried that approach and not something else.\nAnd if reporters succeed in using their skills as a journalist and as a writer and a storyteller and a broadcaster to explain our approach, then I can't really complain. They've done their job. And if I have confidence in our approach, then I'm going to have confidence in the idea that if somebody makes an honest effort to explain that approach to the American people, well, then we're going to persuade some people that what we're doing is the right thing to do, even if it's not showing the immediate results that we would like.\nThis gentleman right here.\nQ: Bouncing off the previous couple questions about access, I was wondering if you could comment on the access or, in some cases, reduced or lack of access of young people and college students across the country to fully participate in public service and the life of our country. There's been reports in the past couple years about certain sorts of hostile echo chambers that pop up in D.C. because of the lack of ability for funding for internships for places like the White House, where we sit today, Congress, other federal agencies, et cetera.\nThere's a tension there, obviously, because the idea of public service to necessitate something. But on the other hand, if some people are boxed out of being able to participate while they're in college, something that we're very lucky to do today, there's tens of thousands more of us who would love to be able to be sitting in this seat right now. So I was wondering if you could comment on any possible changes in the ways the White House or across the federal government -- access for college students going forward to more fully participate and represent the mosaic of America in D.C.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, the President often says that the most important role in our democracy is not the role of President, but actually the role of citizen. And looking for ways to engage people in the process of governing this country is something that the President has made a priority. And this is one of the reasons that we're hosting this event here today, is the President is interested in cultivating your interest in government and certainly your interest in playing an important role in our democracy by considering a career as a professional journalist.\nSo I think that's the first way that I would answer your question. The second way is that people don't have to work in politics or even cover politics full time in order to be engaged in our democracy. What people do have to do is they have to make an effort to go and inform themselves and educate themselves about what's happening in your community or in our country. And that is a big challenge. And that's not something that the government can do for you, and that's not something that necessarily includes a paycheck. But that is a responsibility that we all have as citizens of this country -- to educate ourselves about the questions that are being raised about our government, to establish some priorities in our own right for the direction of the country.\nAnd one of the observations that the President often makes about the media is that there are places you can go on the Internet to just go and read articles or opinions written by a whole bunch of people just like you who have the same views. And it requires a certain amount of self-discipline to actually seek out different points of view. So listening or inviting input from people who may not share your worldview is a valuable thing. And it's something that is critical if we're going to be good citizens of our country and active participants in our democracy. And the President gave -- as you think about this, the President gave a commencement address at the University of Michigan where he talked a lot about sort of the role of citizenship in a modern democracy like ours. So you can hear more directly from the President on that.\nThis young lady right there.\nQ: Earlier today we talked with Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett on restorative justice work, like within school districts, for students who are getting suspended or expelled. And my question is, what is the administration doing to work with school districts who want to go after those initial acts?\nMR. EARNEST: It's nice to meet you. You may have heard a little bit about this from Secretary John King. The Department of Education has worked closely with states and school districts across the country, and I know that Secretary King's predecessor, Arne Duncan, was very interested in this issue as well. What you often find in the federal government, particularly when it comes to education, is that we have a tradition in this country of local control of schools. Now, that's a good thing. We want communities to be engaged and to play the predominant role in setting policies and guidelines for how the schools in those communities are going to operate.\nBut what the federal government can do is to offer some expertise and to share best practices, and bring schools and administrators together to help them understand how these problems are being handled in other communities. And so what this administration has done is made an effort to try to lift up best practices, to seek out the most effective educators, particularly when it comes to disciplinary policies, and make sure that we're sharing those ideas with other schools.\nAnd there's plenty of academic data and research to indicate that there is some bias inherent in the way that some schools administer discipline, and that does put some students -- particularly minority students -- at a disadvantage. And helping well-intentioned administrators recognize the potential for bias and give them some tips for how to work around and overcome it is a really valuable thing. And I know that this is something that the Department of Education has made a real priority.\nYes, that gentleman right there.\nQ: What is the future of historically black colleges and universities after the Obama administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, under President Obama's leadership, funding for historically black colleges and universities has increased. President Obama has had an opportunity to deliver a couple of commencement addresses at HBCUs. In both of those speeches, the President has talked about how important a role those institutions play not just in a modern African American community in the United States, but actually a role they have to play in our country.\nThe President is actually going to speak at Howard University later this summer at their commencement. The President is looking forward to that opportunity and it will be an opportunity for him to both reflect on the tradition that's built into HBCUs of providing a good, high-quality education to African Americans, but he'll also talk about the responsibility that those who graduate from those kinds of institutions have to contribute not just to the African American community but to our country as a whole. And this is something the President feels strongly about, and something he'll talk about again later this summer when he speaks at Howard.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: We just released our sexual assault climate survey, or the results of the survey, rather. And it turned out Fordham is reporting sexual assault just a little bit above the national average, which is around 5 percent right now -- we're reporting at 8 percent. So I was wondering if the administration is doing anything to incentivize colleges to increase that percentage to make it easier and more accessible for victims to report their sexual assault so we can get more accurate numbers on how sexual assault exists on college campuses.\nMR. EARNEST: Well -- that seems like a bad thing. (Loud noise.) It's that remote there, guys. There we go. That's never happened before. (Laughter.) So, I'm sorry that had to happen to you.\nYou've asked a very serious question. What the administration has done is tried to work with colleges and universities to help them establish a clear process for reporting these kinds of crimes when they occur, and making sure that there's a process internally for handling them appropriately, consistent with fairness but also consistent with the law. So that is certainly an important step.\nThe other thing that we believe is important is transparency. As students are considering which college or institution to attend, they should understand exactly what the climate is like on that campus -- how safe are they going to be if they go to school there; how much of a priority have school administrators made the safety of their students. So that kind of transparency is important as well.\nBut look, as I was saying earlier, this can't just be about government. This also has to be about students taking responsibility for what happens on their campus and what kind of community they want to be a part of, and how willing are they to engage in that community to assert the kinds or norms and mutual respect that we'd all like to have, particularly when we're living in a community like a college campus where we're sort of encouraged to try new things and to explore new experiences; that having a safe environment in which to do that is particularly important.\nYes, that gentleman right there.\nQ: We've heard a lot today, especially from the Education Secretary, of Pay As You Earn loan repayment plans for student loans. However, the reason we're talking about it is because 70 percent, according to the GAO -- 70 percent of delinquent borrowers are eligible for Pay As You Earn, but aren't on the plan. How did the number get so high?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a couple of reasons. One is that the Pay As You Earn program is something that's relatively new, and we are setting a goal today to try to expand the number of people who take advantage of this program. The Pay As You Earn program essentially caps your student loan repayment rates at 10 percent of your income.\nThe President has also fought hard to establish the CFPB.\n[The President enters the room.]\nEND 3:53 P.M.

{"author": "Bernie Sanders", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117562", "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Ore. - Saying that \"our job is to revitalize American democracy,\" U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday challenged the Democratic Party establishment to decide if it will fight for working families or do the bidding of Wall Street, big oil, the pharmaceutical industry and other special interests.\n\"Are we on the side of working people or big-money interests? Do we stand with the elderly, the sick and the poor or do we stand with Wall Street speculators and the insurance companies?\" the Democratic Party presidential candidate asked 8,300 supporters at an outdoor rally at Island Park.\nHe said a key reason why 63 percent of voters did not go to the polls in the last election and nearly 80 percent of young and low-income people stayed home is that \"the Democratic Party, up until now, has not been clear on which side they are on on the major issues facing this country.\"Do we stand with the elderly, the sick and the poor or do we stand with Wall Street speculators and the insurance companies?Sen. Sanders, Springfield, Ore.\nOn issue after issue, Sanders challenged the Democratic Party to pick sides. \"You can't be for Wall Street and the working people of this country. You cannot be for the drug companies and senior citizens and veterans,\" he said. \"You cannot be on the side of workers and support those corporations that have thrown millions on the street.\"\nThe failure of Democratic leadership to send a clear message on where the party stands is why Republicans have grabbed control Congress and Statehouses. \"The problem in my view is not that the Republicans are winning elections. It's that Democrats are losing elections,\" he said.\nSanders also faulted Democrats for not pushing election reforms that would increase voter turnout and help Democrats win elections. For example, he said, Democrats should get behind legislation he introduced in the Senate to register everyone to vote when they turn 18 years old. \"The Democratic Party has got to be very clear. We need automatic voter registration.\" In 2015, Oregon became the first state in the nation to require state agencies to automatically register voters when they get a new driver's license or identification card.\nHe also called on Democrats in states where access to the voting booth is restricted in primary contests to open the process and let millions of independents participate, \"Republican governors want to make it harder to vote. Our job is to bring more people into the system. We need open primaries.\"\nSanders also spelled out differences with Hillary Clinton. On trade policy, he opposed and she backed most of the job-killing trade deals. On climate change, he challenged Clinton to support a carbon tax to discourage burning the fossil fuels that are warming the planet. He pressed her to support a nationwide ban on fracking that imperils safety of drinking water and encourages fossil fuel. He asked Clinton to join him in supporting a Medicare-for-all health care system and to crack down on pharmaceutical companies that charge Americans the highest prices for prescription medicine anywhere in the world.\n\"Secretary Clinton may not believe the American people have the ability to take on the insurance companies and take on the drug companies. I disagree.\"\nSanders also cited his big leads over Republican White House hopefuls Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Sanders beats Trump by twice as big a margin as Clinton. He also holds leads over Cruz and Kasich. She holds a narrow edge over the Texas senator and loses in many polls to the Ohio governor.\n\"I hope delegates to the Democratic National Convention take heed of this,\" Sanders said at the rally.\nSanders, who launched his campaign one year ago as an underdog, has so far won 17 primaries and caucuses and amassed 1,350 delegates to this summer's Democratic National Convention. He has set fundraising records with 7.3 million donations. And he is drawing the biggest crowds for any presidential candidate.\n\"I think Secretary Clinton and I agree that we must not have a Republican in the White House but I think the evidence is overwhelming that you are looking at the strongest Democratic candidate,\" Sanders said. \"And the reason for that is that our campaign is able to reach beyond the Democratic base and win the support of millions of independents.\n\"This is the campaign that is generating excitement and enthusiasm and a large voter turnout.\"\nOregon is among 14 states, territories and the District of Columbia which have yet to vote in the contest between Sanders and Hillary Clinton. He thanked U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon for being the only member of the United States Senate \"to have the guts\" to back Sanders.", "timestamp": "2016-04-28", "title": "Press Release - Sanders to Democratic Party: Whose Side are We On?"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122658", "text": "\"I'm only here because this country gave me a chance through education. We are here today because we believe that in America, no hardworking young person should be priced out of a higher education. This country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of young people willing to work for it.\"\n– President Barack Obama, Remarks on College Affordability, June 9, 2014\nHigher education is one of the most important investment individuals can make for themselves and for our country. Today, 11 of the 15 fastest-growing occupations require a postsecondary education. That's why the President has made historic investments to help millions of Americans afford college by doubling investments in grant and scholarship aid through Pell grants and tax credits, keeping interest rates low on federal student loans, and creating better options to help borrowers manage debt after college like the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plan.\nAs detailed in a  new post on student debt trends and state-by-state data being released by the Council of Economic Advisers, we are seeing these efforts pay off. More students are graduating college than ever before. More than four of five Direct Loan recipients with loans in repayment are current on their loans. Delinquencies, defaults, and hardship deferments are all trending downward, with nearly three million borrowers successfully accessing a pathway out of default through loan rehabilitation since 2010. And more students are taking action on their student debt when they need support, with nearly five million Direct Loan borrowers taking advantage of repayment options like the President's PAYE plan, which caps monthly student loan payments at 10 percent of income, up from 700,000 enrolled in 2011.\nMany students access student loans to help finance their education; typically, that investment pays off, with bachelor's degree recipients earning $1 million more in their lifetime and associate's degree recipients earning $360,000 more, compared to their high school counterparts. But for some, burdensome student loan debt can present a challenge as they seek to start a career, raise a family, purchase a home, start a business, or save for retirement.\nGuaranteeing strong consumer protections and building a system of high-quality customer service are important components of a federal student loan system that expands college opportunity and provides reassurance to American families that pursuing a college degree and responsibly borrowing to pay for college will not threaten their future financial security.\nToday, the White House is announcing new actions and highlighting the progress already made to help ensure the more than 40 million Americans with student loan debt understand their repayment options and access high-quality customer service, strong consumer protections, and targeted support to repay their student debt successfully.\nNew Actions on Student Debt\nOver the past few years, the Administration has stepped up efforts to ensure that flexible repayment options are available to support Americans with federal student debt. Today's actions build on that progress and provide a roadmap to guide and support borrowers as they seek to manage and repay their debt successfully:\n•      New Goal to Enroll 2 million More Borrowers in Plans like Pay As You Earn (PAYE). The President's PAYE and related income-driven repayment plans are available to help borrowers who may be struggling to manage their debt effectively. Yet, too many borrowers still do not know about this important option. Leveraging key improvements in loan servicing and customer service, better tools and resources, targeted outreach to borrowers, and partnerships with key external organizations under the Student Debt Challenge, the Administration is announcing a new goal to enroll two million more borrowers in plans like PAYE by this time next year.\n•      Launch of StudentLoans.gov/Repay. To help borrowers easily navigate the complexity of student loan repayment options, the U.S. Digital Service and the Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid have launched StudentLoans.gov/Repay to help drive students to their best repayment option in five steps or less. Built mobile-first, and using human-centered design, StudentLoans.gov/Repay was designed to make repayment information as easy to understand as possible.\n•      Strengthening Consumer Protections through New Standards for Student Loan Servicing. The Department of Education and Department of the Treasury - after consulting with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and their work with Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan and other state attorneys' general - have developed clear student loan borrower rights and protections in three key areas: (1) providing accurate and actionable information about account features, borrower protections, and loan terms; (2) establishing a clear set of expectations for minimum requirements for communication and services provided by student loan servicers, including adequate and timely customer service; and (3) holding servicers accountable for fixing errors, being responsive to borrowers, and resolving problems by ensuring that borrowers, federal and state agencies and regulators, and law enforcement officials have access to appropriate channels of recourse when violations of federal or state consumer financial laws occur. The Department of Education will ensure all borrowers with federal Direct Loans can rely on high-quality service in line with these standards and protections. The Department of Education will implement this effort as part of its  new vision for servicing student loans.\n•      Better Information to Help Borrowers Take Action on their Debt: CFPB Prototype Student Loan Payback Playbook. The CFPB is seeking comment on a new set of student loan servicing disclosures—a student loan Payback Playbook – that provides borrowers personalized information to better understand their repayment options and find a monthly payment they can afford. To help borrowers choose the best repayment plan with the most up-to-date information based on their circumstances, borrowers would see a plain language Playbook on their monthly bill, in regular email communications from their student loan servicer, or when they log into their student loan account. The Department of Education, working with the CFPB, will be finalizing and implementing these disclosures for federal loans borrowers.\n•      Ensuring Effective Student Loan Counseling. The Department of Education will work to improve the timing and content of current loan counseling efforts, including statutorily required entrance and exit counseling, to help students make better borrowing decisions, increase college completion, promote successful loan repayment, and reduce delinquencies and defaults. Specifically, the Department will upgrade and redesign its Entrance and Exit Counseling tools on StudentLoans.gov – which serves 6.5 million students a year – based on user analytics and direct input from more than 500 borrowers, financial aid administrators, policymakers, and higher education organizations. The Department is also developing a loan counseling experiment to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of different counseling tools and the impact of offering borrowers more frequent information and guidance beyond the statutorily required one-time entrance and one-time exit counseling.\n•      Leveraging Research to Drive Better Student Outcomes. The Department of Education will pilot Advancing Insights through Data (AID), a research partnership program that will offer other federal agencies and affiliated researchers data access to conduct research that can inform and advance policies and practices that support students' postsecondary success and strengthen repayment outcomes for borrowers. Starting with Federal Reserve Board researchers this fall, the program will allow experts to apply to securely access and match administrative student aid data files with other survey and administrative data, while ensuring safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of students and families. AID builds on the Administration's recent efforts to leverage government data in ways that can improve service delivery, promote transparency, and strengthen accountability, particularly through the College Scorecard, which includes the most comprehensive, reliable data ever published on students' post-college earnings and repayment outcomes. The Department is also exploring future opportunities for new research partnerships.\n•      Modernizing Credit Reporting for Student Loans To Ensure Fair Treatment Of Borrowers. The Department of Education and the Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the CFPB, are working collaboratively with the credit reporting industry to develop guidance for servicers, lenders, and others who furnish data to the credit bureaus to determine how best to report student loan data so that it is fair, consistent, and accurately reflects repayment activity. This effort is another critical part of the Department's  new vision for servicing student loans.\n•      Over 40 new student debt challenge takers. Earlier this month, the White House issued a call to action for colleges, universities, non-profits, businesses, state and local governments, and other employers to help more borrowers better understand their options, and to take action to enroll those borrowers in PAYE and related plans so they can manage their monthly payments and avoid delinquency and default. Today, we are highlighting a growing list of commitments from organizations working to inform their employees and members about PAYE and related plans, train human resources (HR) staff on the importance of helping borrowers understand their student loan repayment options and the steps individuals must take to enroll, and use digital platforms to highlight PAYE and related plans. In the few short weeks since the Debt Challenge was launched, there have been over 40 commitment makers, and we are encouraging more colleges, businesses, non-profits to  take action. As of April 26, the list of commitments includes:\no      ACCESS College Foundation\no      AFSCME\no      Achieving the Dream\no      American Student Assistance\no      American Sustainable Business Council\no      California State University, Long Beach\no      California Association of Nonprofits\no      The Century Foundation\no      College Advising Corps\no      College Forward\no      College Greenlight\no      Dyersburg State Community College\no      Florida International University\no      Friendship Public Charter School\no      Indiana University\no      Iowa State University\no      Jobs for the Future\no      Lake Area Technical Institute\no      Lone Star College\no      Marcus Foster Education Institute\no      Marks and Associates\no      Montana State University Bozeman\no      Morgan State University\no      National Housing Resource Center\no      Natixis Global Asset Management\no      New Haven Promise\no      Operation HOPE, Inc.\no      Parkway School District\no      Pharr-San Juan-Alamo Independent School District\no      Rutgers University - Newark\no      Tennessee Technological University\no      University of Pittsburgh\no      University of Memphis\no      University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville\no      The Institute for College Access and Success\no      The State University of New York\no      University of Michigan - Ann Arbor\no      University of Northern Iowa\no      United Tribes Technical College\no      Valencia College\no      Young Invincibles\nIn addition, several organizations are committing to take additional action:\n•      Civic Nation, in partnership with the digital agency, HUGE, has expanded their Up Next guidance and reminder tool to include information about income driven repayment options. Up Next will send text notifications to individuals who sign up to remind them about their loan repayment options and to provide guidance on how to sign up for different repayment plans.\n•      College Forward will coach 6,000 plus motivated, underserved students to achieve the benefits of higher education and a college degree. They will educate the students they serve about the benefits of loan repayment options like PAYE and refer them to the resources available at financialaidtoolkit.ed.gov. College Forward will also recruit 80 plus recent college graduates through the AmeriCorps program to serve as mentors within their program.\n•      Fidelity Investments has taken action to support employees with student debt and is piloting new solutions to better educate and empower student borrowers. This January, Fidelity Investments® announced a new employee benefit called the Step Ahead Student Loan assistance program, which provides eligible employees with more than six months of tenure $2,000 dollars per year toward their student loans (up to $10,000 dollars) and since its launch has enrolled 5,000 Fidelity associates who are receiving payments – saving a total of $1.5 million in interest and principal in the first month alone. Building on this work, Fidelity will pilot programs to better educate borrowers by aggregating all their loans in one place, show the best strategies to pay them down; educate borrowers on various repayment options including PSLF (Public Service Loan Forgiveness); and frame student loans in the context of other financial priorities, such as retirement.\n•      Houston Community College (HCC) will use its team of financial coaches to hold workshops and one-on-one financial coaching sessions for current students and borrowers who have completed or left college to assist them with understanding student loan repayment options and help guide the students with taking advantage of the repayment options such as PAYE. HCC will also work to support student loan repayment on campus and in the local community through outreach to employees, parents, and community members.\n•      National Housing Resource Center (NHRC) will train 500 housing counselors to help student loan borrowers qualify for income-driven repayment plans, by conducting a national training program for nonprofit housing counselors. The housing counselors will be able to work with their prepurchase, loss mitigation, and financial assistance clients and help them identify the appropriate plan.\n•      Nerd Wallet pledges to promote the use of income-driven repayment options when appropriate to the three million consumers that use their website monthly to make and manage financial decisions. Through easy-to-follow articles and free tools, NerdWallet breaks downs the basics of the plans, who they're best for and how to enroll in them to ease the burden of student loan debt.\n•      Rite Aid commits to inform and assist their 90,000 associates, including 12,000 pharmacists, with strong financial planning support, including ensuring awareness of programs, like Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE). Rite Aid will inform their employees of their ability to enroll in PAYE through their pay stubs twice a year, link to the PAYE website on their internal communications portal where their associates can access information about the program, and include messaging about financial assistance programs, like PAYE, in their company's human resources newsletters and communications.\n•      Student Debt Crisis will continue their student loan education by conducting student loan trainings for more than 2,000 professionals through the National Housing Resource Center. They will also work with CalNonprofits to help them build out a student debt program educating between 400 and 1,000 nonprofit professionals about repayment options and public service loan forgiveness who can help spread the word. Student Debt Crisis plans to conduct a series of webinars to reach more than 800,000 people within their membership network.\n•      The Center for American Progress, working in partnership with Generation Progress and Higher Ed, Not Debt, has educated their employees about the benefits of these programs for the last two years. As part of the challenge they will educate, engage, and mobilize Americans – including their own employees – around the issue of income-driven repayment plans, beginning on $1T Day, the national day which marks student debt surpassing one trillion dollars. These efforts will include social media chats and in-person events, starting with a D.C. event with policy experts. Additionally, CAP, GP, and HEND will work with partner organizations to host webinars and workshops. Altogether, these efforts can reach 5,000 people.\n•      The Institute for College Access and Success (TICAS) will contact the more than 100,000 subscribers to their website, share information with their social media networks to remind them about income-driven repayment plans and encourage them to help spread the word to others.\n•      The State University of New York has committed to spreading the word to their nearly 1.4 million students and employees about income driven repayment options through regular information sharing, debt management counseling for at risk students, and through their new SUNY Re-Enroll to Complete program which encourages recently withdrawn students to return and finish their degrees.\n•      The University of California commits to regularly informing its more than 246,000 students and 200,000 faculty and staff about income driven repayment options and public service loan forgiveness through its regular contacts, as well as by sending additional information to the main campus alumni relations offices, student services staff, and the system's human resources professionals.\n•      YI Advisors, the social impact arm of Young Invincibles, commits to piloting a new technology platform to help students and borrowers 1) better understand their student loan debt; 2) compare government repayment options including PAYE, and other plans; 3) get reminders about recertification and application deadlines; and 4) get help enrolling in PAYE and other income-driven repayment plans and programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness that are currently under-utilized. They will work with a range of partners (from schools to non-profits to private sector) to distribute and pilot the student loan education platform with borrowers and identify areas for improvement.\nIn the coming weeks and months, the White House will continue to encourage organizations to take the Student Debt Challenge, and will announce additional challenge-takers. New Federal Commitments to Tackle Student Debt include:\n•      The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) will share information with current AmeriCorps members, AmeriCorps alums, and grantees about income-based repayment options, such PAYE. CNCS will also ensure that more members and grantees have information about other ways to reduce their student loan burden, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness. CNCS will also continue to encourage colleges and universities to match the Segal AmeriCorps Education Award that members receive at the end of their term of service. This year, approximately 75,000 AmeriCorps members are serving with thousands of organizations across the country, and more than 980,000 AmeriCorps members have served over the last 20 years. Since the inception of AmeriCorps in 1994, AmeriCorps members have earned more than $3.1 billion in education awards to pursue further education or pay off their student debt. In addition, CNCS has made more than $93 million in interest forbearance payments covering the interest cost of students loans for AmeriCorps members during their terms of service.\n•      Honoring Our Federal Workforce. The US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will coordinate an interagency effort to provide the federal workforce access to the information necessary to use one of the four income-based student loan programs and Public Service Loan Forgiveness options in order to reduce their family's student loan debt. Through the remainder of the Administration, OPM will collaborate with human capital professionals and senior leaders across agencies to develop effective strategies for communicating the options available to the federal workforce. These strategies will be woven through OPM's existing efforts to encourage and advance Hiring Excellence and enhance employee engagement in order to recruit and retain a first class federal workforce.\n•      Streamlining Systems So More Students Can Access Financial Aid Resources. The United States Digital Service (USDS), working with the U.S. Department of Education Federal Student Aid Office (FSA) will review and streamline the process of creating an FSA ID – which is the new financial aid username and password – so students can complete the FAFSAs and so borrowers can log to manage their student loans, through a more secure and protected system. USDS and FSA will also simplify the income-driven repayment plan application process so that it is simple for borrowers to enroll to manage their debt using an income-driven repayment plan. Part of this work will be to establish a centralized point of access for all federal student loan borrowers, starting with the needs of the borrower. Finally, USDS and FSA will digitize the process of applying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness so that teachers, firefighters, people serving their communities through non-profits, and others who are eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness do not struggle with paper processes to have their loans forgiven.\nBuilding on a Record of Progress\nAmericans with student loan debt deserve high-quality customer service and the consumer protections necessary to ensure they can effectively take action on their student debt. Over the past few years the Administration has stepped up efforts to ensure that there are options available to support Americans who may be struggling with student loan debt.\n•      Making College More Affordable and Keeping Student Debt Manageable. Since the President took office, the Administration has  increased the maximum Pell award by over $1,000, and for the first time, tied aid to inflation to maintain its value. These efforts have  cut the cost of college by about $3,700 on average for over eight million students last year. This Administration also established the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), which provides up to $10,000 over four years of college, which will help nearly 10 million families cover the costs of tuition and other educational expenses, saving on average $1,800 in 2016. To ensure student loans are manageable, the Administration has cut student loan interest rates, saving a typical student $1,000 over the life of loans borrowed this year, and began implementing the  Student Aid Bill of Rights to strengthen loan servicing and make it easier for students to access the information they need to choose repayment plans. Meanwhile, defaults, delinquencies, and forbearances are trending downwards.\n•      Accomplishments on the Student Aid Bill of Rights. Since the President's announcement of the Student Aid Bill of Rights in March 2015, the Department of Education, in collaboration with other federal agencies, has worked to:\n* Identify Best Practices in Performance-Based Contracting including identifying a strong performance-based compensation structure focused on supporting borrowers with the greatest risk of default; setting performance metrics and allocation methodology to drive strong borrower outcomes; requiring standardized service-level minimums including standardized communications focused on risky borrowers; creating robust borrower protection and complaint resolution processes to ensure strong accountability; and establishing strong oversight processes and enforcement mechanisms including penalties for noncompliance or contract violations.\n* Protect Social Security Benefits for Borrowers with Disabilities through  a new process to proactively identify and assist federal student loan borrowers with disabilities who may be eligible for Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) loan discharge. Approximately 387,000 borrowers were positively identified in the first set of matches, which were conducted in December 2015 and March 2016. In total, these borrowers have a combined loan balance of over $7.7 billion, and roughly 179,000 are currently in default. As required by federal law, over 100,000 of those borrowers with defaulted loans have been certified for the Treasury Offset Program, and are therefore at risk of losing federal tax refunds, and of having their Social Security benefits offset. This month, borrowers who were positively identified in the match will receive a customized letter explaining that the borrower is eligible for loan forgiveness and the simple steps needed to receive a discharge. Unlike other borrowers, those identified through the data match will not be required to submit additional documentation of their eligibility. Instead, they are eligible for a streamlined process by which they simply sign and return the completed application.\no      Find New and Better Ways to Communicate With Borrowers by conducting five pilots to test the most effective ways to share information about loan repayment options with borrowers. These pilots reached over four million borrowers this past year and will reach an additional three million by the end of the summer. The Department of Education collaborated with the White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team to utilize research and behavioral insights about how borrowers consume information, consider their options, and make decisions about repayment. Randomized-controlled trials were used to test the effects of how choices are framed and the importance of personalized information. These insights are being used to inform a new repayment campaign to reach over a million borrowers in their grace period that are about to enter repayment. Building on these successful pilots, the Department of Education is making plans to standardize communications about loan servicing so that information received is accurate, personalized and consistent, ensuring that borrowers receive the information that they need to successfully repay their loans.\n*  Create a Responsive Student Feedback System to give students and borrowers a simple and straightforward way to file complaints and provide feedback about federal loan lenders, servicers, collections agencies, and institutions of higher education. Beginning on July 1, 2016, the Enterprise Complaint System (ECS) will enable customers to submit complaints, positive feedback, and allegations of suspicious activity regarding their Federal aid experience directly to the Department of Education and receive responsive, meaningful resolutions. Customers will be able to view, track, and manage their cases through an easy-to-use online portal or by calling a dedicated support center. In addition, the data collected by the Department will be analyzed and used to drive enhancements to internal student aid operations and inform policy discussion on relevant topics.\n*  Strengthen the Student Loan System to Better Protect All Borrowers through a report released last October, in consultation with the Department of the Treasury and CFPB, the report outlined a series of statutory, regulatory and administrative recommendations to safeguard student borrowers including calling on Congress to simplify income-driven repayment plans; ensuring service members don't lose their interest rate protections under the Servicemember Civil Relief Act when consolidating their loans; strengthening protections against predatory third parties that charge borrowers exorbitant fees for services that are available for free at studentaid.gov and enhancing federal data-sharing to improve borrower experiences and simplify the application process for borrowers' to re-certify eligibility for income-driven repayment over multiple years.", "timestamp": "2016-04-28", "title": "Fact Sheet: Taking Action to Help More Americans Manage Student Debt"}

Earnest's briefing with college reporters in progress.]\nThe President. Hey!\nPress Secretary Earnest. Oh, well——\nThe President. I hear there's some hotshot journalists here.\nPress Secretary Earnest. Here, let me move this—[inaudible]\nThe President. Josh was speaking for me, and I wanted to make sure he was getting it right. How's it going, everybody?\nAudience members. Good!\nThe President. Are you guys having an interesting time here?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Was Josh thorough in his briefing?\nAudience member. Yes.\nThe President. Well, I heard you guys were around today, so I wanted to stop by and say hello. I also have a bit of breaking news for you, and then I might take some questions.\nI heard—overheard Josh talking about student loans, and I know that's a big priority for a lot of your listeners and readers. And that's one of the reasons why my administration has spent a lot of time focused on college affordability. So we expanded Pell grants to make sure that more young people could access it. We created the \"Pay As You Earn\" program that ensures that people can cap the amount that they're repaying on their loans each month, and—so that young people who want to go into jobs that don't—aren't as lucrative are still able to pursue their passions and their dreams while managing their debt load.\nToday I want to announce that we're aiming to enroll 2 million more people in \"Pay As You Earn\" by this time next year, and you can find out how at studentloans.gov/repay. That's studentloans.gov/repay. And we're also going to be making some additional announcements about how we're going to get our agencies coordinating so that, as young people are managing their student loan debt, there's one-stop shopping, they can figure out how to do it, and they can make sure that there are consumer protections in terms of how they're being treated in the repayment process.\nWhile I have you here, I might as well mention a couple other things. [Laughter] You may have heard that there is a Supreme Court vacancy. For those of you who have been studying our system of government, we have three branches, and one of the most important is the judiciary. And right now our Supreme Court is absent one sitting member, with the passing of Justice Scalia. I've nominated an individual named Merrick Garland, who's currently the Chief Judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which is the second most important court in the land. By all accounts, he's extremely well qualified. And traditionally, what's happened is, is that the Senate then, exercising its constitutional duties of advise and consent, will meet with the judge and then have a hearing for him and then have a vote. In part because politics have gotten so polarized lately and the importance of this seat, so far, at least, the Republican leader on the Senate side, Mitch McConnell, has refused to have the Republican caucus meet with him and schedule an actual vote, although, to their credit, there have been a number of Republicans who have broken ranks and gone ahead and met with Judge Garland.\nI mention this because I think it's important for all of you, while you're in town, and many of you who are going to end up being journalists covering important national policy, to recognize that our system only works when, even when we have big disagreements, even when there are big policy disputes, there's still a willingness to follow the rules and treat people fairly, especially those who are on the other side of the debate. That's something that's been lost a little bit in this town of late.\nAnd as I said at my State of the Union Address, my hope is, is that despite some of the unusual rhetoric that we've been hearing during this Presidential campaign, that it's young people like you who are going to restore that sense of us being able to work together and make this democracy function effectively. And journalists are—play a critical role in that. Sometimes, both Josh and I probably have our disagreements with the press corps and feel picked on or misunderstood—[laughter]—but the truth of the matter is—and I've said this before—what separates us out in part from a lot of other countries in the world is, we've got this incredible free press that pokes and prods and calls into account our leaders. And that is how we can make sure that leaders are accountable to the people who elect them. And that's how we make sure that you don't see major abuses of power, and when you do, that, in fact, the American people know about it and are able to make changes.\nAnd so you guys are going to have a critical role, those of you who end up following journalism. I hope many of you do. I want to thank the White House press corps, because I understand they gave you a lot of time today. And some of the best journalists in the country operate here. I normally don't say nice things about them in front of them—[laughter]—but I figured since they took the time to work with you today, I wanted to make sure to acknowledge the great work that they are doing.\nAll right? So with that, I'm going to take a couple of questions. [Laughter]\nAll right, let's see. We'll start with that young man right there in the black suit—or blue, I guess. [Laughter] Well, no, no, right here, right here in the red tie. But I may get to—I may get to you too, so—[laughter].\nPresidential Interview Request\nQ. Mr. President, it's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dan Corey, and I'm the editor in chief of the Daily Targum. It's the second oldest college newspaper in the United States. And it serves the Rutgers University-New Brunswick community.\nThe President. Outstanding.\nQ. We recently ran a student referendum to keep our presence on campus. We've asked and we are allowed to continue publishing. And we're actually going to reach a historic 150 years of publication.\nThe President. Congratulations. Q. Thank you very much. I'm also very nervous right now, but—[laughter].\nThe President. You're doing great so far. [Laughter] Just never admit that you're nervous. [Laughter] Just pretend like this is routine. [Laughter]\nQ. Well, in light of the news of you speaking at our commencement, I was wondering, would you be interested in being interviewed by our newspaper? [Laughter]\nThe President. That's a good use of your time right there. [Laughter] I have to say that normally I coordinate carefully with my press team before we grant interviews, but I am favorably disposed towards giving you a little bit of time. It may not be a really long interview, but I figure we could give the college newspaper a little bit of——\nPress Secretary Earnest. That's a good idea.\nThe President. ——little bit of play. So all right? Young lady, right here.\nFlint, MI, Drinking Water Crisis/Infrastructure/Environment\nQ. Mr. President, it's an absolute pleasure. My name is Emily Archacki reporting for the Spectrum newspaper—[inaudible]—Sacred Heart University. My question is, you announced the other day that you'll be visiting Flint, Michigan——\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. ——based on a letter received from a young girl. What are you planning to do during your visit there? And have you heard from the girl in response to your visit? And if possible, after, may I take a photo with you? [Laughter]\nThe President. All right, the photo I can't do, because if I do, then I've got a long line.\nQ. Okay, I figured that was the case.\nThe President. But I will be visiting Flint. And obviously, since the news of the terrible things that have been taking place there—the lead in the drinking water and the potential health hazards, as well as the people who were responsible for the health and safety of those residents not carrying out their duties the way they need to—I think it's important not only for us to have responded as we have, with FEMA, and—that's the Federal Emergency Management Agency that responds to a lot of problems like this—it's important not only that we are helping the city plan over the long term, but I think it's also important for me to shine a spotlight on the fact that Flint, although extreme, is not unique; that we have underinvested in some of our basic infrastructure that we rely on for our public health. And hopefully, it will give me a chance to speak to the Nation as a whole about how we need to ensure that our air is clean, our water is clean, and that our kids are safe. And I hope I get a chance to meet that young lady as well.\nQ. Thank you.\nThe President. All right, young man right here.\nThe President's Achievements/Presidential Library Plans/Post-Presidency Plans\nQ. Hello, Mr. Obama, it's a pleasure. I'm Jessy Diamba from the University of North Texas, and I just had two questions for you. First of all, what is your proudest achievement you've achieved here in these 8 years? And after January 20, what are your goals or plans after you leave the White House? The President. Well, I'm proud of a lot of stuff: providing health insurance to 20 million people who didn't have it and setting us on a path where, hopefully, everybody has health insurance that's affordable and high quality. I'm proud about the work we did to save the economy. Because right after I came in, we were in a freefall and could have experienced a worldwide depression. I'm proud of the reforms we've done on Wall Street to make sure that the recklessness that led to the crisis hopefully doesn't happen again.\nI'm proud of the work we've done in education to make sure that millions of kids who previously couldn't afford to go to college can, and that in addition to the work we've done on student debt and reducing that, we've also been doing things to make it—the process of encouraging young people to go to college easier. And I—this is a good time for me to give a shout-out to the First Lady, who, as many of you know, just this week had her annual signup, getting young people to apply for the FAFSA form that is the gateway for you to be able to get financial aid. She was up in New York, but it was, I think, a thousand participants nationwide who are helping to let young people know, if are willing to work hard and have a vision for your future, then nothing is preventing you from getting the kind of higher education that you need.\nSo I'm proud of all that stuff. I—probably, the thing I'm most proud of is that, mainly as the assistant to Michelle Obama—[laughter]—I've done—I've raised two daughters who are amazing that—and I'm really, really proud of them. And being able to do that while still focused on my job, I think, is something I'll look back on and appreciate.\nI'm really busy right now, so I'm not thinking too much about after the Presidency. Typically, Presidents build libraries, but I'm more interested in the programming, not just a building. And I'm very confident that a lot of the programming that I do will relate to young people and how I can encourage them to get involved in civic life. All right?\nLet's see. I'm trying to alternate boy-girl-boy-girl here—[laughter]—just to be fair. Young lady right there, in the red. Yes, you.\nQ. Hey, my name is——\nThe President. Hey! [Laughter]\nImmigration Reform\nQ. My name is Daniella Oropeza, and I'm reporting for NewsWatch Ole Miss at the University of Mississippi. And pending the Supreme Court's decision, will this administration take further action on immigration?\nThe President. As you know, we took some initial steps to try to make a more rational, smarter immigration process. Our immigration system has been broken for quite some time. On the one hand, you've had some serious work by our administration and previous administrations to slow the flow of undocumented workers across the border, to strengthen border security, to improve how we manage the influx of folks who come in by air, and to make sure that they're not overstaying their visas and so forth.\nOn the other hand, we also want to remind everybody, this is a nation of immigrants and immigrants—immigration has been a source of strength for our country and that we have people here who may not have initially come here legally, but have since that time put down roots, raised families. They're our neighbors, they're our friends. They may be, in some cases, seeing their sons and daughters go off to war in our country's uniform, and that it doesn't make sense for us to simply pretend like we're going to send all those folks out, and instead, we should bring them out of the shadows and give them a chance to earn legal residence and ultimately citizenship.\nSo we put forward a plan. Part of it we were able to implement: the DREAM Act kids who we were able to make sure were treated like the young Americans that they are. We then had an additional program through administrative action that the Supreme Court put a stay on—or the lower courts put a stay on, and is about to go to the Supreme Court. In part, the process takes a long time generally. With the Supreme Court one Justice short, it will be interesting to see whether or not they can come to a ruling or whether they're—they arrive at a tie, a 4-4 tie. We don't know yet. That's pending.\nIn the meantime, we're still implementing a number of reforms and changes to make the system—the legal immigration system smoother, not as expensive, fairer to people, to treat families with more respect. We have changed our priorities in terms of enforcement so that we're not deporting and separating families as much and more focused on going after criminals and people who pose a security threat to the community. But our hands are a little bit tied on some of the bigger things until the Supreme Court rules.\nNow, even if we do all that, it's critically important that we still push Congress to pass legislation, because my Executive orders can be overturned by the next President. And the only way to have a permanent solution to this problem is for the kind of legislation to pass that we saw the Senate actually pass on a bipartisan basis that would continue to strengthen border security, but also give a pathway to citizenship for those who had been here for quite some time. That way we can be a nation of law and a nation of immigrants, and it's the right thing to do. I'm not optimistic about us getting the legislation done before I leave, given the makeup of this Congress, but I think this is going to be a major issue in the election, and I—people need to pay attention to it.\nAll right, I'm going to take two more. Two more questions. Let's see. You're all very good-looking people, I've got to say [Laughter] The—this gentleman over here. I haven't forgotten about you over there. Go ahead.\nSyrian Refugees\nQ. My name is Alden Woods, I work for the Indiana Daily Student at Indiana University. My question is about the Syrian refugees.\nThe President. I thought you were going to ask about basketball \"rings.\" [Laughter]\nQ. We can do that if you want. [Laughter]\nThe President. No, go ahead.\nQ. As the deadline for your pledge to let in 10,000 Syrian refugees gets kind of closer, starting to creep up on us, it looks kind of iffy whether that's going to be made. Do you have any plans to speed up that flow or encourage more Syrian refugees coming in the country?\nThe President. Well, we're going to keep on pushing. And part of what has made this challenging is that we want to make sure that we can, as much as possible, provide the American people an assurance that everybody here has been vetted at a very high standard.\nAs you will recall, there was a lot of emotions around our initial announcement that we should be admitting some Syrian refugees, and people making claims that somehow this would be letting potential terrorists onto our shores. The truth of the matter is, is that the refugee process generally is much more rigorous in its screening and its vetting than the average tourist who comes in here. These are people who themselves have been victims of terrorism and victims of incredible violence and suffering at the hands of the Asad regime in Syria.\nIt is the right thing to do. Our closest friends and allies, like Canada, like Germany and other European countries, as well as countries bordering Syria, like Turkey and Jordan, have taken on an enormous burden. And as the most powerful nation on Earth, it's important for us to do our duty as well here, our humanitarian obligation. And it's important for us to send a signal around the world that we care about these folks.\nSo administratively, I think now we have the process to speed it up. There are going—may be efforts on the part of Congress to try to block us, but our goal is to continue to try to make the case to Congress and the American people, this is the right thing to do. And we believe that we can hit those marks before the end of the year.\nMore broadly, one of the things we're going to be doing is, at the United Nations, we're going to convene at the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, which takes place in September every year. We're going to try to make sure that we have an international conference around how we can deal with much larger refugee flows generally. Some of them, as a consequence of conflict, in some cases because of drought or other natural disasters, there are about 60 million displaced people around the world. And I've met with some of them, not just in—those who are fleeing areas like Syria, but also in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. And a lot of these folks are your age or younger, have the same hopes, dreams, aspirations, and have just been dealt a very bad hand.\nWe can't solve every problem in the world, but we have to make sure that we take leadership in trying to help stabilize their lives. Okay?\nAll right, I'll take two more, because I promised that I was going to get that young man who thought I had called on him. Yes, go ahead.\nCollege Affordability\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President, for joining us here today. My name is Sonali Seth, and I'm from the University of Southern California, here representing the Daily Trojan. In light of your Pell grant announcement today, it seems like a central tenet of your administration's strategy in addressing college affordability is increasing access to grants and loans. How sustainable would you say the strategy is in addressing the long-term rising trends of the cost of college?\nThe President. That's a great question. It is not sustainable if the overall cost of college keeps on going up as fast as it's going up. So one of the things that we have to do, even as we make sure that we're providing more access to grants, keeping loans manageable, interest rates at a reasonable level, we still have to work with colleges and universities to figure out new ways to reduce costs. And we've actually seen universities around the country begin experiments that are having some impact. I'll just give you a couple of examples.\nI made an announcement a while back about our initiative for making the first 2 years of community college free. That's something that is affordable for most States to do, and we are prepared to help with Federal support. If we are able to do that—and we could just close a few loopholes that corporations currently use to avoid paying taxes to pay for it—then for a large proportion of young people who either get their primary secondary school education from a community college or started at community college and then transferred to a 4-year university for graduation, their costs are being cut anywhere from half to a hundred percent, down to zero. And this is something achievable. Now, Congress has not moved on our proposal. But what we've also seen is that there have been 27 jurisdictions around the country that have taken us up on this challenge and are doing it themselves, are figuring out ways to make this happen. So that's an—one example.\nA second example. Some of you, because I can tell that you guys were high-achieving, type A folks—[laughter]—unlike the kind of slacker kid that I was—[laughter]—some of you, I suspect, were taking college-credit courses while you were in high school. And what we've seen is, a number of high schools systems—or public school systems partner with community colleges and universities so that they make arrangements. You start taking your college credits while in high school, and you extend your—what seems like high school for an extra year, and when you graduate, you now have an associate's degree, so you have the equivalent of a community college degree. When you then go to a 4-year institution, you have enough credits that you can graduate in 3 years instead of 4. That, again, by eliminating 1 year, means that you've just reduced your costs significantly.\nThere's been discussion of how can we use technology to cut costs. Are there ways in which we can take the best practices of online learning and make that more accessible for young people who may not have the luxury of being on a campus for 4 years with room and board, might have to work part time because they need to help their families or support themselves? Are there ways that we can make that work?\nAnd we have to be careful about that because there have been some for-profit institutions that, frankly, haven't done a very good job. They take the money, but the young person who—who's taking classes with them doesn't end up getting a degree that's useful for them getting a job, and then they have problems repaying their loans. But there's no doubt that, if done well, that technology potentially can reduce costs.\nAnd then, we're talking to colleges and universities about what are the contributors to these higher costs. And this may be sensitive to some folks, but I've said this before: If you have the option of cutting your college costs in half, but your dorm rooms aren't quite as nice, or the sports facilities or the student center or the cafeteria aren't as good, is that a deal you're willing to take? And can we figure out how to empower more parents and more students to demand a lower cost option that still gives you a great education, but maybe doesn't have all the bells and whistles to it.\nAnd that's part of the reason why we've put forward this college report card. The idea is just—it provides you online data so that as you're selecting a college or university that you're able to see, all right, what are the costs, what are the graduation rates—all the indicators and benchmarks of getting good value for what you're spending.\nAnd this has been a long-term trend of ever-rising college costs. The good news is, is that through the work that we've done over the last several years, we've started to see some good trends. Delinquencies, hardship deferrals, defaults on student loans have started to go in the—a better direction. They were skyrocketing. Some of that is the improvement of the economy generally; some of it is some of the policies that we've engaged in. But we're going to have to keep on working with universities to make sure that we're doing a smarter, better job in order for the people who are coming behind you to be able to afford college. All right?\nLast question. The gentleman right there.\nU.S. Political System/Campaign Finance Reform/Voter Participation\nQ. Hi, Mr. President. Earlier today we spoke about—— The President. What's your name?\nQ. Patrick Forrest from the Fresno City College Rampage.\nThe President. From the what?\nQ. Fresno City College, the Rampage.\nThe President. Fresno City College. Fantastic.\nQ. Earlier today we talked—one thing we talked about was civic engagement and a line you used in the State of the Union Address of \"don't give into the cynicism of the day.\"\nThe President. Right.\nQ. A poll released by Reuters yesterday shows that nearly half of Americans feel that the elections are rigged in some way.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. Do you—is there any goal or plan for the administration to help revitalize the faith in democracy that is seemingly lacking?\nThe President. Well, you know what, this is something that I've tried to do ever since I got into public office. As you know, I came into this work as a community organizer and strongly believed that our democracy only works when people participate.\nThere are a lot of forces that feed cynicism. And there's no dispute that our democracy is not working as well as it should. I can tell you some of the reasons for that. One of it is that we have set up a system for electing State legislatures and Members of Congress that involve the drawing of district lines that are gerrymandered. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the phrase, it basically means that those who are already in power draw the maps in such a way where they can be assured that these are either going to be Democratic seats or Republican seats. And what that's done is, it's made very few seats competitive.\nSo, for example, in the last election, in 2012, Democrats actually cast substantially more votes in congressional elections, but ended up with substantially fewer seats. And the reason for that is, in 2010, when the census was done and redistricting of congressional and House legislative seats were drawn, Republican Governors and Republican majorities were responsible for drawing most of the seats.\nNow, I want to be clear, Democrats aren't blameless on this either. But California, for example, has gone to a process of nonpartisan districting. The advantage there is not only do you make more seats competitive, but it also means that politicians have to compete for everybody's votes because they're not in safe seats, they're not in a safely Republican district or a Democratic district. And what that does is, it means they've got to not just appeal to the extremes of their party.\nPart of the reason we've seen polarization and gridlock here in Washington is because there's been this great sorting, and Democrats have moved much further—have moved left. Republicans have just gone way to the right. And it's harder then to compromise, because Members of Congress—and this same thing is true in State legislatures—are always looking over their shoulder seeing if somebody in their own party might challenge them. And then, the system doesn't work. So that's a big chunk of why people are cynical—because they feel like their don't—their votes don't count. And if you draw districts that are ironclad one party or another, then they're not entirely wrong.\nAnother reason that people are cynical is money in politics. The Supreme Court issued a ruling, Citizens United, that allowed super PACs and very wealthy individuals to just finance all these ads that you guys see on TV all the time. Half the time, nobody knows who's funding them. And that makes you cynical partly because most of this money is spent on negative ads. And so you're just hearing constantly how horrible everybody is. That will make you feel pretty bad about the political process.\nAnd I'm a strong believer in finding ways in which we can make the financing of campaigns more democratic. Now, we've seen some interesting work being done, for—you've got to give Bernie Sanders, for example, credit, building off some of the work that I did. I, in turn, built off the work that Howard Dean did for smaller donations, grassroots donors to be able, in small contributions, to allow candidates to be competitive.\nBut I think that we don't want to leave that to chance. And that's much harder to do for Members of Congress who are lower profile so they don't get the sort of viral presence that allows them to raise that kind of money to compete. So we're going to have to solve money in politics.\nYou as journalists are going to have a role to play in reducing cynicism. It is very hard to get good stories placed. People will assign you stories about what's not working. It's very hard for you to write a story about, wow, this thing really works good.\nAnd just to take the Federal Government as an example, every day, I've got 2 million people who work for the Federal Government—whether in our military, our law enforcement, our environmental protection, helping veterans, et cetera—and they are doing great work. And you rely on it in all kinds of ways, including when you check the weather, because you can thank the National Weather Service for putting satellites up so your smartphones tell you whether to bring an umbrella or not. [Laughter] But we just take that for granted.\nAnd if, out of those 2 million employees, one person screws up somewhere—which, every day, you can count on somebody out of 2 million people probably doing something they shouldn't be doing—that's what's going to get reported on. Now, that helps keeps Government on its toes and accountable. But one of the things we have to think about is, how do we tell a story about the things we do together that actually work so that people don't feel so cynical overall?\nBut look, here's the bottom line, is that—let's take the political process. As cynical as everybody is, and everybody is always trying to come up with these radical new plans to try to fix our democracy, and we need to do this, and we need to do that, the truth is, is that part of the reason why our Government doesn't work as well is because in a good Presidential year, slightly more than half the people vote who are eligible, and the other half don't. And during an off-year election, when the President is not at the top of the ticket and people aren't getting as much attention, 40 percent of the people vote.\nNow, this system doesn't work if people opt out. And the easiest cure, the simplest cure for what ails our democracy is everybody voting. Now, it's true that there are some States that purposely make it hard for people to vote. We're the only major democracy in the world that actively makes it hard for people to vote. And so you should be—particularly as—in your student newspapers, as you go back to your home States—you should be asking, why is it that we have laws that are purposely making it harder for people to vote, purposely making it harder for young people to vote.\nAnd there's a political agenda there. The people in power don't want things to change. They want cynicism, because obviously the existing system, as frustrating as it is for everybody else, works for them. Well, if you want to upend that, we've got to vote.\nBut even in those States that purposely make it harder to vote, the truth of the matter is, on your college campuses, half the folks, maybe two-thirds of the folks who don't vote, don't vote because they're just not paying attention. They don't consider it important. And they're not willing to take the 15 minutes or half hour that it takes to make sure that you're registered and make sure you actually vote.\nWell, if you care about climate change, you care about college costs, you care about career opportunities, you care about war and peace and refugees, you can't just complain. You've got to vote. And what's interesting is, is young people as a voting bloc are the least likely to vote, but when you do vote, have the biggest impact on elections.\nDuring a Presidential year, young people account for, like, 19 percent of the total vote. During an off-year election, when folks aren't paying as much attention, they account for 12 percent. And that means that the kinds of candidates that get elected and the priorities that they reflect are entirely different, just based on whether or not you guys are going to the polls.\nSo don't let people tell you that what you do doesn't matter. It does. Don't give away your power. That should be the main message that you deliver all the time. And it doesn't matter whether it's—you're a Republican, Democrat, Independent; whether you're conservative on some issues, liberal on others. If you participate and you take the time to be informed about the issues, and you actually turn out and your peers turn out, you change the country. You do. It may not always happen as fast as you'd like, but you'll change it.\nSo I'll keep on talking about this even after I leave the Presidency. I'm—this is—you got me started. I went on a rant, didn't I? [Laughter]\nAll right. So I'm counting on you guys. Don't let me down, all right? Don't let the country down. You guys are going to be delivering the message to your peer group that this is the greatest country on Earth, but only because we have great citizens who are willing to invest their time and energy and effort to become informed on the issues, to argue about it in a respectful way, and to try to collectively solve the many challenges that we face.\nThe good news is, is that there are no challenges, as JFK said, that \"man creates that man can't solve.\" I would add women to that. [Laughter]\nAll right? Good luck, guys. Bye-bye.", "timestamp": "2016-04-28", "title": "Remarks to College Reporters and a Question-and-Answer Session"}

For generations since, Jewish Americans, having shared in the struggle for freedom, have been instrumental in ensuring our Nation stays true to the principles enshrined in our founding documents. They have helped bring about enduring progress in every aspect of our society, shaping our country's character and embodying the values we hold dear. This month, as we pay tribute to their indelible contributions, we recommit to ridding our world of bigotry and injustice and reflect on the extraordinary ways in which Jewish Americans have made our Union more perfect.\nMany of the Jewish people who reached our Nation's shores throughout our history did so fleeing the oppression they encountered in areas around the world. Driven by the possibility of charting a freer future, they endeavored, on their own and as a community, to make real the promise of America—in their individual lives and in the life of our country. Determined to confront the racism that kept this promise from being fully realized, many Jewish Americans found a cause in the Civil Rights Movement that—in its call for freedom and justice—echoed the timeless message of Exodus and the Jewish people's journey through the ages. Reflecting on the march in Selma, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel once noted, \"I felt my legs were praying.\" From the fight for women's rights to LGBT rights to workers' rights, many in the Jewish American community, drawing on lessons from their own past, have trumpeted a clarion call for equality and justice.\nWe cannot pay proper respect to the legacy of Jewish Americans without also reflecting on the rise of anti-Semitism in many parts of the world, and in remembering the lessons of the Holocaust, we recognize the imperative need to root out prejudice. Subjecting men, women, and children to persecution on the basis of their ancestry and faith, the scourge of anti-Semitism demands that we declare through action and solidarity that an attack on one faith is an attack on all faiths. That is why the United States is leading the international effort to combat anti-Semitism—we helped organize the first United Nations General Assembly meeting on anti-Semitism last year, and we are asking countries around the world to join us in giving this challenge the focus it demands. In celebrating Jewish Americans' contributions to our country, we also reaffirm our unshakeable commitment to Israel's security and the close bonds between our two nations and our peoples. Throughout my Administration, the multifaceted relationship between our countries has grown and strengthened to an unprecedented degree, particularly with regard to U.S.-Israeli security assistance and cooperation.\nThe Jewish American experience and our Nation as a whole have always been held together by the forces of hope and resilience. During Jewish American Heritage Month, as we reflect on our past and look toward the future, let us carry forward our mutual legacy, grounded in our interconnected roots, and affirm that it is from the extraordinary richness of our bond that we draw strength. And let us renew our dedication to the work of building a fully inclusive tomorrow—one where a great diversity of origins is not only accepted, but also celebrated—here at home and around the world.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as Jewish American Heritage Month.

As a Nation, we have a duty to empower each child so they have the same sense of promise and possibility as any other young person no matter who they are, where they come from, or what their circumstances are. Foster youth deserve the security and strong support structures they need to achieve their dreams. During National Foster Care Month, we lift up our Nation's foster children, celebrate the selfless men and women who embrace children in the foster care system, and we recommit to helping more children find permanency so they can feel stable, grounded, and free to fulfill their limitless potential.\nWith open hearts, families and professionals across America work each day to give foster youth the resources, warmth, and care they need. Over 400,000 children remain in the foster care system, and tens of thousands of youth age out of foster care before they find their forever family. Only half of children in foster care complete high school by age 18, and less than 5 percent graduate college. Young people who age out of foster care without a permanent home are often at higher risk of entering the criminal justice system, and they can face greater challenges to completing an education, obtaining high-quality health care, and securing gainful employment. We also know kids are better off when raised by loving families, not institutions. These difficult outcomes are often exaggerated further when children are placed in group homes.\nI am committed to preventing youth from falling into these situations. I have proposed allowing child welfare agencies to use Federal funds to provide critical services and shelter to foster youth who have aged out of the system until they are 23. My Administration is also working to reduce abuse and neglect by focusing resources on strengthening families so children stay out of foster care in the first place. Children living in foster care are more likely than other children to be overprescribed medication for social-emotional and mental health disorders. That is why my Administration is encouraging greater use of evidence-based screening, assessment, and treatment of trauma and mental health disorders for kids in foster care. And because every child deserves access to quality, affordable health insurance, the Affordable Care Act requires each State to extend Medicaid coverage to foster children who have aged out of the foster care system until the age of 26.\nChildren grow to become their best selves when they are surrounded by supportive families. Caretakers support foster youth and help them see a future of greater promise and hope. Last summer, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality, giving more kids in foster care the opportunity to be part of a loving family. My Administration will continue fighting to ensure eligible and qualified caretakers have the chance to become an adoptive or foster parent regardless of race, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation. The commitment and dependability of a family can provide foster youth with the confidence to write and control their own destiny. Family is the bedrock of the American story, and we must do everything we can to support all young people so they can be free from harm, healthy, and ready to chart the course of our Nation's unwritten history. When we create environments for all young people to grow and flourish and safely live as who they are regardless of race, background, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity our country is stronger. This month, and every month, let us pay tribute to the children in foster care and the dedicated parents and professionals who tirelessly work to shape their lives. And as a country, let us embrace the spirit that every child matters and continue working to provide all of our daughters and sons with an equal chance to lead productive and fulfilling lives, limited by nothing but the power of their imaginations and the scope of their dreams.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as National Foster Care Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month by taking time to help youth in foster care and recognizing the commitment of all who touch their lives.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-28", "title": "Proclamation 9432—National Foster Care Month, 2016"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation was published in the  Federal Register  on May 3.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117439", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nNearly 44 million American adults, and millions of children, experience mental health conditions each year, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress. Although we have made progress expanding mental health coverage and elevating the conversation about mental health, too many people still do not get the help they need. Our Nation is founded on the belief that we must look out for one another—and whether it affects our family members, friends, co-workers, or those unknown to us—we do a service for each other when we reach out and help those struggling with mental health issues. This month, we renew our commitment to ridding our society of the stigma associated with mental illness, encourage those living with mental health conditions to get the help they need, and reaffirm our pledge to ensure those who need help have access to the support, acceptance, and resources they deserve.\nIn the last 7 years, our country has made extraordinary progress in expanding mental health coverage for more people across America. The Affordable Care Act prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against people based on pre-existing conditions, requires coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services in individual and small group markets, and expands mental health and substance use disorder parity policies, which are estimated to help more than 60 million Americans. Nearly 15 million more Americans have gained Medicaid coverage since October 2013, significantly improving access to mental health care. And because of more than $100 million in funding from the Affordable Care Act, community health centers have expanded behavioral health services for nearly 900,000 people nationwide over the past 2 years. Still, far too few Americans experiencing mental illnesses do not receive the care and treatment they need. That is why my most recent Budget proposal includes a new half-billion dollar investment to improve access to mental health care, engage individuals with serious mental illness in care, and help ensure behavioral health care systems work for everyone.\nOur Nation has made strong advances in improving prevention, increasing early intervention, and expanding treatment of mental illnesses. Earlier this year, I established a Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force, which aims to ensure that coverage for mental health benefits is comparable to coverage for medical and surgical care, improve understanding of the requirements of the law, and expand compliance with it. Mental health should be treated as part of a person's overall health, and we must ensure individuals living with mental health conditions can get the treatment they need. My Administration also continues to invest in science and research through the BRAIN initiative to enhance our understanding of the complexities of the human brain and to make it easier to diagnose and treat mental health disorders early.\nOne of our most profound obligations as a Nation is to support the men and women in uniform who return home and continue fighting battles against mental illness. Last year, I signed the Clay Hunt SAV Act, which fills critical gaps in serving veterans with post-traumatic stress and other illnesses, increases peer support and outreach, and recruits more talented individuals to work on mental health issues at the Department of Veterans Affairs. This law will make it easier for veterans to get the care they need when they need it. All Americans, including service members, can get immediate assistance by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK or by calling 1-800-662-HELP.\nDuring National Mental Health Awareness Month, we recognize those Americans who live with mental illness and substance use disorders, and we pledge solidarity with their families who need our support as well. Let us strive to ensure people living with mental health conditions know that they are not alone, that hope exists, and that the possibility of healing and thriving is real. Together, we can help everyone get the support they need to recover as they continue along the journey to get well.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as National Mental Health Awareness Month. I call upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, health care providers, and research institutions to raise mental health awareness and continue helping Americans live longer, healthier lives.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-28", "title": "Proclamation 9433—National Mental Health Awareness Month, 2016"}

Sadly, it happened in London last Friday, when the President of the United States informed the British people they would be at the \"back of the queue\" for a US-UK free trade deal if they dared to vote to leave the EU on June 23. This was nothing less than a slap in the face of British self-determination as the president, typically, elevated an international organisation over the rights of a sovereign people.\nI believe Britain's future in Europe is a matter for the British people to decide. If Britain does vote to leave the EU, the United States should respect that decision — and treat it as an opportunity for our own country.\nIf I am elected to be the next president of the United States, we will ensure that the special relationship is strengthened rather than weakened, and that America works closely with Great Britain to address the myriad challenges faced by the free world, from Islamist terrorism to a resurgent Russia.\nIf Brexit takes place, Britain will be at the front of the line for a free trade deal with America, not at the back. There is a vast amount of trade, commerce and investment between our two nations. And, as I explained when I delivered the Margaret Thatcher Freedom Lecture in 2014: \"Such an agreement between the US and the UK would be an opportunity to mutually deregulate our economies — in contrast to the TTIP, which is proving an exercise in ‘harmonising' regulations . . . Deregulation is a powerful, liberating economic force that can lead to significant economic growth — something Lady Thatcher understood all too well. Such an agreement can also be an aspirational model for other nations, encouraging them to look to bedrock principles of conservatism and individual liberty.\"\nIn marked contrast, Barack Obama has appeased America's enemies, and has taken every opportunity to curry favour with those who seek to threaten our interests. The reality is that Obama reserves his harshest language for our friends while offering generosity and platitudes to our enemies.\nCompare, for example, his menacing words in London last week with his cordial March 21 press conference alongside President Raul Castro in Cuba. Mr Obama refused to confront the vicious Castro dictatorship over its brutal torturing and jailing of political prisoners. He left unmentioned its systematic economic exploitation of its people. The Castros' half-century of sponsoring violent terrorism was ignored. Instead, the president praised \"the values that we share\" and spoke of a \"new hope for the future.\" Most astoundingly, he affirmed \"that Cuba's destiny will not be decided by the United States or any other nation. Cuba is sovereign . . . and the future of Cuba will be decided by Cubans, not by anybody else.\" This could have been a \"tear down this wall\" moment, standing with the Cuban people fighting for their freedom. Instead it was an act of humiliating abasement before a grizzled tyrant who loathes America.\nAs usual, Mr Obama has the situation exactly backwards. We should be respecting the rights of the British people to participate in their democratic process, and denouncing the Castros' illegitimate oppression of their own people. And rather than trying to eke some meagre profits out of Cuba's anaemic, state-run system, we should be exploiting the opportunity to partner with the far more powerful British economy.\nThe British people will shape their destiny, and we will stand with them regardless of the outcome of the referendum. As president, I will work to ensure that our special relationship is reinvigorated — and the Obama doctrine of coddling tyrants while castigating democratic allies will finally be at an end.", "timestamp": "2016-04-29", "title": "Press Release - ICYMI: CRUZ: Britain Will Be at the Front of the Queue for a US Trade Deal"}

I was going to tell you all to be seated, but I see you are already seated, so we can begin. Josh is out today. He has, I believe, it's a root canal. (Laughter.) Yes, he has a root canal. But let's be honest, I'm better at this than he is anyway. Just between us.\nFirst, I have two announcements and then I'll take questions. First, the President is still working on his jokes for the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I don't have any details on that other than he intends to be funny -- very funny. Okay, and second, it is Friday, which means at half-past five I will be performing The Jackal in my office for anyone who is interested or remembers or cares. (Laughter.)\nSo now I'll take your questions.\nOh, Josh! You're back!\nMR. EARNEST: This is not your show anymore!\nMS. JANNEY: Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry. I just -- I was in town and I just wanted to take a moment. Totally, this is your office.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you're standing at the podium, so you might as well use it.\nMS. JANNEY: All right. In all seriousness -- what do you mean? This is just happening.\nIn all seriousness, my name is Allison Janney and I am here today to draw attention to the opioid epidemic and to celebrate those who are working to help others combat substance-use disorder. And I'm actually on a show now called \"Mom,\" which deals with people in recovery. And I'm here with my co-creator and executive producer, Chuck Lorre, who is -- this issue is very important to both of us. He's in the back there.\nToday, here at the White House, 10 individuals from across the country will be honored as White House Champions of Change. They've been selected from over 900 nominations for their leadership in preventing prescription drug abuse and heroin use, and for increasing access to treatment and to support their fellow Americans in recovery -- for supporting their fellow Americans in recovery.\nThis is a disease that can touch anybody, and all of us can help reduce drug abuse through evidence-based treatment, prevention, and recovery. Research shows it works. And courageous Americans show it works every day. I'm so nervous I can't believe. (Laughter.) So thank you for the opportunity to be here today, and to highlight this important issue. And now I return the podium to its rightful owner, Josh. Thank you.\nQ: Can I ask C.J. a question? (Laughter.)\nMS. JANNEY: Yes, sure.\nQ: Who is President Bartlett supporting in the Democratic Primary? (Laughter.)\nMS. JANNEY: I think you know the answer to that question. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, Allison. Nice job.\nMS. JANNEY: Thank you. (Applause.)\nMR. EARNEST: You're welcome to stay.\nQ: Josh, when is the fun part? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I was going to say, who says we don't have some fun around here? So, obviously Allison thinks -- feels very passionately about the work that she's spending some time here at the White House focused on today. And so we obviously owe her a debt of gratitude for really taking on this cause and it's something that she passionately believes in. And we obviously are pleased that we can work with somebody who is as committed and as talented as she is on something that's that important.\nAll right, the fun stuff is out of the way now. We can go back to our regular Friday afternoon briefing. But we'll try to keep it short, Mark. I know you're ready to start your weekend. (Laughter.)\nQ: Aren't we all? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: That is true.\nKathleen, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure, sure. Well, I feel like a bit of a downer here. I wanted to ask about the report that came out on the helicopter attack on the hospital in Kunduz. I know you mentioned yesterday that the President planned to read it. I'm wondering if he's either been briefed or read it, and if he feels that justice has been served in this case at this point, and if the appropriate reforms and changes have been made.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kathleen, you're right, this is a very serious topic. And it is certainly a topic that the Commander-in-Chief has made a priority. The United States goes to tremendous lengths to avoid civilian casualties. And when those casualties occur, as they did in this instance, the President called for a transparent, thorough, and objective accounting of what exactly transpired.\nAs you point out, this objective accounting was put forward by the Department of Defense today. The President has been briefed on the report. The report is available -- or at least a redacted, declassified version of the report is available on Central Command website, and that is consistent with the President's view of transparency.\nThe report goes into some detail about what exactly transpired. The conclusion of the investigation is that there were human error that causes tragedy. Now, that human error was compounded by systems and procedural failures. The Department of Defense has announced a set of steps that will be taken to provide accountability for those who were involved. The Department of Defense has also laid out some specific reforms moving forward that will prevent this kind of tragedy from occurring again in Afghanistan or anywhere else. And, again, all of this is consistent with the priority that President Obama places on avoiding civilian casualties.\nOur adversaries certainly don't go to these lengths. In some cases, our adversaries target civilian populations. But these are the kinds of reforms that are consistent with our values as a country and are consistent with the priorities that are established by the Commander-in-Chief.\nQ: So someone looking at it at a distance, how exactly then does the President sort of explain how something like this could happen, given all of these safeguards and assurances he gives about civilian casualties? That 42 people died in a hospital could be hit and there's no criminal charges filed, it's just administrative punishment. How does explain the justice?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what the President called for from the beginning was a thorough, objective, and transparent accounting of what transpired. And that's what the Department of Defense has put forward. This is an investigation that was conducted by military officers that were outside of the chain of command. These were individuals -- the individuals who led this investigation are professional investigators, and they're individuals who are not involved in the incident. So they were able to provide an objective perspective on what transpired.\nAnd obviously they've spent months interviewing people who were involved, reviewing relevant facts and material to understand exactly what happened, to understand exactly what led to the failures, including the human error that led to this tragedy. And based on their own working knowledge of how these kinds of military operations are carried out, they made specific suggestions for reforms that could be instituted to prevent something like this from happening again.\nBut there's no denying that what's occurred here is a genuine tragedy, and when this incident occurred, you heard the President and others express their profound sorrow at the loss of innocent life, including individuals who had put themselves in harm's way to try to treat the wounds of innocent people caught in the crossfire.\nSo there are multiple dimensions of this tragedy. And the significance and scale of what transpired explains why such a detailed investigation has been conducted and made public. All of that is consistent with our values. It's consistent with the priorities that the President has established. It's consistent with our commitment to avoiding civilian casualties. And it's consistent with our values as a country.\nQ: Okay, on another topic. There seems to be a little bit of new momentum behind the criminal justice reform effort on the Hill. I just thought I'd give you an opportunity to see whether (inaudible) you felt that momentum here or is there any prospects for this actually happening?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know there was a bipartisan announcement that was made on Capitol Hill, I believe at the end of the day or at least yesterday afternoon. And what we have been saying for months is that the White House role has been to try to nurture and facilitate bipartisan cooperation on this issue on Capitol Hill.\nFortunately, the bipartisan interest in this legislation has been there at the beginning. Democrats and Republicans observed that common-sense reforms to our criminal justice system could not just save taxpayer dollars but it could actually make our communities safer, lower recidivism rates, and give those who have paid their debt to society a better chance at reentering American life and making a substantive contribution to it.\nSo what we have done all along is to try to encourage both sides to continue to find common ground, to present ideas for making that common ground more easily recognized, and there have been some strange bedfellows, given the context of these efforts. There have been representatives from conservative political organizations that had been interested in contributing to this effort as well.\nSo I think it does reflect that what is the subject of some debate is not necessarily something that should provoke a partisan or ideological objection, but rather a more common-sense, practical approach to recognizing the potential benefits of reforms like this. So, sometimes, that kind of pragmatic approach gets drowned out by the partisanship and ideology and occasional histrionics that are endemic on Capitol Hill.\nBut in this case, we're going to continue to work with Democrats and Republicans to try to navigate those cross-currents and hopefully emerge on the other side with a genuine bipartisan reform bill that would have enormous positive consequences for our country. And the President identified this as a top legislative priority of his last year, and we've been working since then to try to make it a reality. And I do anticipate that the President will devote a significant portion of his eight months that remain here in office to getting this legislation passed through Congress an onto his desk.\nHi, there.\nQ: In Syria, there was the short-term truce announced earlier today, and it doesn't seem like it addresses the fighting in Aleppo. So I wanted to see what more information you could give us and what the plan is to address fighting there. And also, are you confident that a date could be set for peace talks to resume?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let's first talk about the agreement that was announced today. Since the beginning of the cessation of hostilities, fighting has continued in the area of north Latakia and eastern Ghouta, putting armed opposition groups there and in other areas controlled by the opposition under pressure. Persistent violations in this area are unacceptable and damaging. As a result, the U.S. government and Russia have been working to secure a general recommitment to the cessation of hostilities by all parties in Latakia and eastern Ghouta to be implemented beginning at midnight tonight, Damascus time.\nIt's our view that this essentially would be a refreshment of the cessation of hostilities, and getting both sides to commit to refreshing the commitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities could have potentially a catalyzing effect. And what we would like to see is a return to the situation on the ground that prevailed a couple of weeks ago, which was not an all-out end to the fighting, but rather a broad acceptance of the terms of the cessation of hostilities. And that agreement was only possible because the United States and Russia used our influence with the relevant groups to bring about that agreement and that cessation of hostilities.\nAnd we acknowledged all along that there were likely to be violations of the cessation of hostilities. But what's happened over the last week or so is that the frequency of violations has increased, and that's been a source of significant concern. So our hope is that by refreshing this agreement, focusing our attention on these two particular areas, we can build momentum again toward a broadly observed cessation of hostilities.\nQ: And how confident are you that this refreshment is going to help push forward these talks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the thing that we know is that the opposite is true. The thing that we know is that the weakening of the cessation of hostilities, or the repeated violations of the cessation of hostilities have tangibly undermined efforts to reach -- or at least to advance political talks. So the question is, can we give some more momentum to those political talks by expanding the area in Syria where the cessation of hostilities is once again observed. And again, our goal of trying to refresh the cessation of hostilities is motivated by a desire to advance the political talks.\nThe other benefit -- and this is another important benefit of refreshed cessation of hostilities, particularly in these two areas -- is it could create space for the delivery of additional humanitarian relief. This part of Syria has been subject to quite intense fighting for a long time now. And there are communities and innocent people there that are suffering. And bringing much-needed humanitarian relief in the form of food and water and medicine could relieve, at least a little bit, so much of the widespread suffering that we've seen in that country.\nQ: On another topic, on the Korean Peninsula, China and Russia today said that they wanted the United States to back off its possible plan to put in an anti-missile defense system near South Korea. What's your reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the reaction to that is that the United States' commitment to South Korea's security is rock-solid. The Republic of Korea is a close ally of the United States, and that means the United States is prepared to invest resources in keeping them safe. We have seen repeated provocations, particularly in just the last few months, from North Korea, vowing to use their military might against our allies. And we've begun -- there already has been a significant commitment of military firepower and manpower by the United States to defend South Korea. And the assessment of our military and national security experts is that additional resources could be necessary to ensure the safety and security of the Republic of Korea.\nSo that's why the United States has engaged in conversations with our South Korean allies about deploying what's called a THAAD battery. This is essentially a sophisticated anti-ballistic missile system that would enhance our ally's security. Those discussions are ongoing. I'll just point out that that equipment would be oriented toward the threat that is posed by North Korea, not oriented toward China or Russia. That's been our contention all along, and those are the facts. And it's certainly changes in the environment, at least in the behavior of the North Korea government, that is prompting this consideration of increasing our posture on South Korea. It's not a result of changes that are made by Russia or China.\nQ: So talks are ongoing with South Korea. Can you give us any sense of timing or when you expect the talks to conclude?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an updated sense of timing at this point. But obviously these conversations have been occurring for several weeks now. But I don't have an announcement to make yet about a particular decision.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. More than once, China has now expressed its annoyance at this THAAD possibility. So if that's going to go through -- and you do expect that to be completed, is that right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't prejudge the outcome. Obviously we would defer to the preferences of our allies in South Korea about whether or not they would like to have this additional equipment located on their territory. The assessment of our military and national security experts is that it could be a good idea for them to do that. But ultimately, this is a sovereign country, and because they're an ally of the United States, we're looking for ways to help them. And this is one potential way we could offer some assistance to them and enhance their security. But ultimately, they would make the final call.\nQ: But at this point, there's no reason to think that that wouldn't be completed, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't prejudge what the outcome here would be. I would just note that our officials have concluded it might be prudent, and we'll have a conversation with the Koreans about that.\nQ: Okay. So if we already know that China is not happy about this, and they've expressed it more than once, if this does go through and that system is deployed there, is that going to affect China's pressure on North Korea, which many feel is the only way to eventually get North Korea to change its behavior?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it shouldn't. Let me explain a couple reasons why.\nThe first is, of course, the THAAD battery would be oriented to the threat in North Korea, not oriented to China in any way.\nQ: What if they don't like it, though?\nMR. EARNEST: They don't, but those are the facts. The second fact is that we already know that China is understandably concerned about the behavior of the North Korean government. These repeated provocations and violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions are destabilizing. And it's not at all in China's interest to have that kind of destabilizing activity right on their doorstep.\nSo the point is, China, using its influence on the North Korean government to get them to end their provocative acts, is not something that they do as a favor to the United States. They're focused on getting North Korea to end their provocations is rooted in their own self-interest, which is that having all this provocative behavior and this conflict and this destabilizing activity on their doorstep is not in their interest.\nQ: Do you expect THAAD to affect the relationship between the U.S. and China in any way, though? Or do you expect it to prompt China to, I don't know, keep on militarizing or militarizing faster the islands that the U.S. disagrees with?\nMR. EARNEST: I mean, obviously, there's a reference to the situation on the South China Sea. That is obviously an entirely -- I mean, it is an entirely different part of the world, both literally and figuratively here.\nQ: But do you expect some tit for tat if this goes through?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't predict what the Chinese response would be, even if this is something that were eventually decided.\nI think what I would say is that there's an opportunity for the United States and China to work together -- and we have, effectively -- to increase the pressure on the North Korean government to change their behavior. We've ramped up the pressure, but thus far we have not seen the change that we are both seeking. And as a result, we have felt that it's necessary to begin at least talking to our allies in South Korea about enhancing their national security. But that is not going to in any way diminish our interest in trying to make the Korean Peninsula more stable and less a source of tension in the region.\nQ: Okay. And looking at the way the campaigns are playing out, it was just a few days ago that Hillary Clinton's communications director called Bernie Sanders \"destructive,\" said that he's not \"productive for Democrats, not productive for the country.\" Does the President feel like Democrats are united right now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, we're still in the midst of a primary. And obviously, the Democratic Party has been engaged in a competitive process. That's appropriate. That's a way we can -- that's the way the party can evaluate who the strongest candidate is. And obviously, the party has a strong interest in choosing the strongest candidate to represent the party in the general election.\nBut these are decisions for voters to make. And the President, as a voter, has cast a ballot, but has not weighed in publicly about who his preference is.\nSo at some point, I think the President will make a strong case about the need for the Democratic Party to come together in support of the policies that he's fought so hard to put in place. That will be a fundamental question in the election.\nQ: So you said multiple times that you welcome robust debate, this is just what happens with the election; it's good for the country. But at the same time, we've heard the President say at a private event that Democrats really need to come together right now. So would you disagree with words like that, that Sanders has been a destructive influence not only on Democrats but on the country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've done my best to stay out of the middle of the debate between the two Democratic candidates, and I'm going to try to do that in this case.\nI think what the President is focused on is ensuring that when the general election does roll around -- and it hasn't yet -- but when we get knee-deep in a general election, it will be important for Democrats to keep in mind what their priorities are. And obviously, the President has spent the better part of seven and a half years fighting for a set of priorities, and he'll, I'm confident, make a case in the general election about the wisdom of continuing that fight. But the time for that part of the debate has not yet arrived.\nQ: So Sanders being called \"destructive\" and \"not productive for Democrats, not productive for this country,\" you don't want to weigh in on whether you agree or disagree with that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't. Because part of working on a campaign is engaging in charges and counter-charges, and I think it is a fair observation to note the difference in tone and tenor between the debate on the Democratic side and the debate on the Republican side. Many Republicans have made that observation. I don't think I'm saying anything particularly controversial.\nBut the President does believe in the value of a robust debate. And politics are tough. But I think what the President is focused on is a general election, and making sure that the people that have been so strongly supportive of his policies over the last seven or eight years realize the stakes of the general election. And the President will have ample opportunity to make that case.\nQ: And not sure if he knows, but this weekend is the White House Correspondents' Dinner.\nMR. EARNEST: I was aware.\nQ: This being the President's last year, is he going to do anything different? Or can you sort of give us a little foreshadowing of what he plans to do with his time? I mean, it's always -- kind of follows the routine, he has a lot of jokes. Is he going to try to put his stamp on it? Anything like that you can say?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't want to give away any surprises, but --\nQ: Will there be surprises?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't rule out a couple of surprises. I think surprise is a key element in humor, and the President is certainly -- I want to protect his ability to surprise you with some good jokes.\nThe President does enjoy this opportunity, that it is something -- the President, over the course of eight years, has given thousands of speeches in public in one form or another. The vast majority of them are dealing with very serious topics. And this is one unique opportunity that he has every year to poke a little fun at himself, poke a little fun at the process, maybe even poke a little fun at a political adversary or two, but it's also a reminder of how in one way or another, we all have a role to play in our democracy. And obviously the President has an important role to set the agenda, but you all have an important role, too, to hold those in power accountable. And the President is respectful of that role, and I'm confident that the President will acknowledge that in the serious portion of his speech because he believes in the value of professional, independent media.\nBut, look, the other way that we can reflect the importance of political journalism in our country is to poke a little fun at the process, and there are ample opportunities to do so this year.\nQ: Is he just going to let loose this year, is basically what I'm asking. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think I'll let you judge, based on his comments, about whether or not he took advantage of the opportunity to let loose, as you described it.\nGo ahead, JC.\nQ: To misquote Richard M. Nixon, the President won't have Donald Trump to kick around anymore. The last time he appeared, I believe, was 2011. He will not be in the audience. Look, does the President regret that opportunity?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm going to preserve the element of surprise here. And I don't think that ducking in the room means that you are going to avoid some attention in the speeches. But we'll see.\nLaura.\nQ: Is the President concerned about the protestors -- again last night, took the street, protesting Donald Trump? That's the first question.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Laura, I think in general there is a long history of and a long tradition of protest in the American political system. In fact, this country was started by a bunch of protestors, some of whom decided that they were pretty unhappy about taxes and threw some barrels of tea in the Boston Harbor. So there's a history of protest in this country.\nWhat the President believes is that we also have a system of government, and there is an opportunity for voters to make their voices heard at the ballot box. And there should be a debate, and there should be a public debate. And that debate is likely to be filled with some emotion. These are serious issues that are being discussed.\nSo while people surely should take advantage of the history and tradition in this country of engaging in political protest, they need to do so with some respect for the system and for our country and for our government, and to ensure that that protest isn't a source of violence, it doesn't incite violence. The protest should not be used to drown out the ability of other people to participate in our political system or to participate in the political debate. But there's a strong history of protest in this country -- that's a good thing. That's something we're proud of as Americans.\nQ: But in a presidential election, outside the United States, the whole world now is watching with quite astonishment what's happening when Donald Trump is speaking. You don't think the President has a responsibility to do something about the potential of violence, which is happening now each time Donald Trump is speaking?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll just say, as a general statement, the President has been outspoken on a number of occasions about how our political system, our form of politics in the United States was geared toward resolving conflicts. This is a big, diverse country, and people are going to have different points of view. And we resolve those differences not through violence, not by taking up arms against one another, not by questioning someone else's patriotism or judging someone based on their religion or their color or who they are, but rather through our system of government, where every citizen has an opportunity to cast a vote and make their voices heard at the ballot box. And that's how our system of government was designed. And that's the way that it should work.\nQ: On Donald Trump again. Yesterday in California, he was talking about his solution to fight ISIS, referring to General Pershing, and it was quite astonishing also for a lot of foreign observers. And on NBC News, he was talking about the possibility to a nuclear ISIS. He said that he won't exclude, if he is elected President, to use the nuclear weapon against ISIS. What's the White House reaction on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let all of you sort of conclude the wisdom of that kind of strategy. I think the President has been pretty clear about what our strategy is. And that is a strategy that is mindful of the need to protect the American people, and that our success in the effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL is not unrelated to how those efforts are carried out.\nFor example, we make it a priority in this country to avoid civilian casualties. That certainly is going to be a lot harder to do if you're using nuclear weapons, or advocating the use of nuclear weapons. In this country, we have made clear that people are included and not discriminated against just because of their religion or what their name is, or how they may have entered the country, but rather they're judged based on their contributions to the country and their contributions to the political debate. And that's not just a reflection of our values, but our commitment to our values is also an important part of advancing our interests around the world and protecting our national security.\nQ: You don't see the need to quiet down the tone at this moment due to what's happening -- the level of anger, frustration, and what's happening in this country? You don't think there's a responsibility to quiet down this tone?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, there's a long history of tough political debate and protest in this country. And, again, that kind of protest and debate was present at the creation of our country. At the same time, leaders in both parties have a responsibility not to incite violence, not to promote discrimination, but rather to, even in the midst of tough political debates, remind us all that there's a whole lot more that we have in common than divides us. And that certainly has been part and parcel of the President's leadership style, even before he entered the Oval Office. And that is a legacy -- certainly an aspect of his legacy that President Obama is quite proud of.\nRon.\nQ: I was reading through the MSF response to the DOD investigation, and without going through all the details, they point out that they've been asking for the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission to look into this. And they say that that has so far gone unanswered. Is there an answer to that request? Or is this the final word on this from the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: I think at this point this is the final word. This is the transparent, thorough, and objective accounting that the President asked for.\nQ: There were other investigations, though, right? There was one involved in the Afghan government, wasn't there? There were other investigations.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't remember. I guess you could check with the Afghan government about that.\nQ: So why not have an international body, a more impartial body? Obviously, the U.S. military has a vested interested in this. Why not have an international nonpartisan? Why not have that?\nMR. EARNEST: Because the President has confidence that the investigation that was conducted was objective. It was conducted by people who were not involved in the particular operation, and it was conducted --\nQ: These are commanders, though.\nMR. EARNEST: No, the investigation was conducted by individuals who are not involved in the investigation. They were outside of the chain of command of those who were involved in the investigation. So that's why we would describe it as an objective investigation and an objective accounting of what exactly transpired. What's also clear here, Ron, is that an investigation that includes suggestions for reforms needs to be conducted by individuals that have their own working expertise of how U.S. military operations are conducted.\nSo I understand sort of the case that you're making for the benefits of an investigation that's conducted by someone outside of the United States military, but I think it's important that you don't overlook the value of choosing somebody who understands how the U.S. military works, who understands how these kinds of operations are carried out, but is also somebody who can be objective because they weren't involved in the operation, they're not in the chain of the command with the individuals who were involved in the operation. They're professional investigators, and they can put forward a clear rendering of what transpired of what steps toward accountability should be taken and what reforms should be implemented to prevent something like this from happening again.\nQ: This internationally renowned and respected organization does not think that this is justice when there are 42 people dead and there's no one held criminally responsible. How do you reconcile that?\nMR. EARNEST: I reconcile that by saying the United States goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. And when those casualties do occur as a result of human error that was compounded by systemic and procedural failures, the United States of America owns up to it. The United States of America conducts an independent investigation to determine what exactly happened. The United States of America, consistent with our values, is transparent about those failures. They're published on a website that all of you can see right now. We've owned up to it. The individuals who were involved and do bear some accountability are held accountable. That's our system. And that is a system that's consistent with our values. It's also a system that follows through on implementing reforms that makes something like this much less likely to ever happen again. And that's what the Commander-in-Chief asked for, and that's what he got.\nQ: Another thing I'd point out is that they believe this focus on intent is not a valid answer to the question of responsibility in determining a crime or a war crime. Clearly, you don't agree with that. But do you see the point, that this idea of intent is not -- it's the result, it's what happened -- and intent is not a way to essentially explain away someone's responsibility.\nMR. EARNEST: I think the passion that's evident in the arguments that are being made by MSF is entirely understandable, and this is a tragedy. And this is an organization that does heroic work around the world. And in this case, some of the individuals that they employ, or at least support, were killed while they were trying to attend to wounds of innocent people who were injured in this conflict.\nSo I think their response is entirely human; one that's entirely understandable, one that's entirely reasonable. But what's also true is that the investigation that was conducted by the Department of Defense is consistent with the orders they received from the Commander-in-Chief. And the American people and people around the world can go and decide for themselves whether or not this investigation was serious. I think when you take a look at a report that extends beyond 100 pages, there's ample detail in there, and it does discuss what transpired and what steps could be taken to prevent these errors from happening somewhere else. And I think that's what the President has been focused on, even in the midst of this terrible tragedy.\nQ: On a much lighter note, the Correspondents' Dinner, when you answered the question before, you said \"ducking the room.\" Were you referring to Mr. Trump in that?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I was just suggesting that --\nQ: Or generally anybody who doesn't show up.\nMR. EARNEST: Even people who don't show up are not necessarily guaranteed to be spared from some good-natured ribbing by the President of the United States or by anybody else who speaks tomorrow night.\nQ: And just one other thing. The Invictus Games -- there's a video going around. Did the Royal Family ask -- how did that come about, I guess is the question that some folks want to know.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the Invictus Games is obviously an international competition by our men and women in uniform. And there's a friendly rivalry between the United States and our allies in the United Kingdom. And the offices of the President and First Lady coordinated closely with the Royal Family to tape these videos and to organize this effort to show their support for our citizens who will be competing in those games.\nQ: And there was what be called some transatlantic trash-talking involved -- (laughter) -- where the Obamas said, \"Bring it on,\" or something to that effect. And the Queen's response was, \"Oh, please,\" or something like that. What is their response?\nMR. EARNEST: (Laughter.) I was going to say, that was quite a reenactment there, Ron.\nQ: I spent a lot of time on it.\nMR. EARNEST: I encourage everybody to go take a look at the video.\nQ: The \"Oh, please,\" from the Queen -- what is the -- you're not frightened by that, I guess.\nMR. EARNEST: Not frightened at all. This is just an attempt to show our strong support for the American and British heroes who will be participating in the Invictus Games. And obviously -- I guess no pun intended -- the Queen was a good sport about it. And so people should check out the video. But obviously, this is a competition to really highlight the service and sacrifice of the best that the United States has to offer, and it's also the best that our allies in the UK have to offer. And it should be a great set of games. They're hosted next weekend in Orlando, Florida.\nQ: Is he going to make fun of the Queen during the dinner?\nMR. EARNEST: I doubt it. She probably does spare some ridicule by not attending the dinner.\nAngela.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You said that the President has been briefed on the report about the accidental hospital bombing. You mentioned yesterday that he might read the entire report. Do you know if he plans to do that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not he plans to read the entire report. I know that he hasn't so far, but he was briefed on the details of the report earlier today.\nQ: And has he or does he plan to reach out to anybody within Doctors Without Borders now that the report has been released?\nMR. EARNEST: You'll recall the President did have an opportunity to speak to one of the leaders of that organization shortly after this incident occurred. I know that the Department of Defense, including General Votel, the newly installed commander of Central Command, has been in touch with senior officials at MSF to discuss the report.\nAt this point, I'm not sure and I don't know of any planned phone calls from the President to MSF officials at this point.\nQ: And then on one other topic, the Supreme Court this morning declined to block Texas's voter ID law. The President has talked frequently about voter access this year. What's his reaction to that action by the Supreme Court?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I didn't see the announcement from the Supreme Court. The President has expressed his significant concern with politically motivated efforts to make it harder for people to vote. As the President observed I believe at this podium yesterday, the United States is the only genuine democracy in the world that actually makes it harder for its citizens to vote than it should be. And there's increasing evidence to indicate that Republicans engage in these kinds of tactics to make it harder for people to vote because they perceive a political interest in doing so. They somehow believe that if fewer people vote, that that's good for Republicans. It's not exactly a motto to be proud of, I don't think.\nAnd so the President obviously believes that when cities and states, and even the federal government, are considering voting laws, that they should do so with an eye toward making it easier and more convenient for citizens who are registered to vote. And that's a principle that he's going to keep fighting for. But it's hard for me to comment directly on a Supreme Court decision without having seen.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Does the President support the idea that some of the women and men who are involved in the accident in Afghanistan should in fact lose their jobs?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I'm not in a position to comment specifically on the accountability measures that were announced by the Department of Defense. As the Commander-in-Chief, and as the spokesman for the Commander-in-Chief, I need to avoid even the appearance of any potential undue command influence.\nSo the President was clear that an objective accounting of the facts and circumstances of this tragedy needed to be brought forward, and that's what the Department of Defense did. And commanders at the Department of Defense took a look at the evidence, they took a look at the report, and they made a decision about the appropriate accountability measures to be imposed. But I'd refer you to the Department of Defense to speak to those.\nQ: But just to put a fine point on it, the President would support their decision should those commanders decide to relieve someone of duty?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I just can't speak in any detail about the specific accountability measures that have been imposed or any potential accountability measures that could be announced at a later date. This is something that was decided by the Department of Defense.\nBut what I can tell you is that the report that was made public today by the Department of Defense is consistent with the President's expectations about the need for a thorough, transparent and objective accounting of the facts.\nQ: Can I ask you about smart guns? The federal government, from my research, is still the largest purchaser of weapons in the United States. Is this an area where the President would like to get more smart guns in the hands of the federal government and make that part of his mandate to push forward this technology?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, earlier today, the White House actually did announce the moving forward on an executive action that the President announced actually early this year. And this is an executive action that would essentially allow law enforcement officials at the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security to begin developing guidelines and standards for smart gun technology.\nAnd the idea is there are a set of standards and guidelines that can be developed that would ensure that smart gun technology could effectively be used by law enforcement officers. And the idea is that, yes, the federal government is a bulk purchaser of firearms, and so it does raise questions about that potential. But that is not the announcement that we made today.\nThe announcement that we made today was this question about specific guidelines and standards, and whether or not those could be developed consistent with the needs of law enforcement officials.\nQ: How concerned is the President about the notion from some gun owners that this is yet another intrusion by the federal government to try to get regular, law-abiding gun purchasers and gun owners to purchase a technology that they're not interested in, which is, somehow mandate this in the future?\nMR. EARNEST: I think this is consistent with the kind of wild-eyed conspiracy theories that we've heard on this issue for years now. I think what is true is I couldn't think of another industry off the top of my head that isn't interested in looking at new technology that could make their product safer. Just about every other industry that I can think of, that's what people do. That's what manufacturers do. That is a source of innovation in a variety of fields.\nI think the best example of this is in the auto industry. Auto manufacturers actually market the degree to which they use new technology to make their products safer, to make cars and trucks safer. And it is surprising to me that so many gun manufacturers shirk that responsibility.\nI think one of the other questions that can be answered by this effort to try to devise a set of standards and guidelines is whether or not a market would emerge for a gun manufacturer that deploys smart gun technology. Is there a manufacturer that comes forward and says, hey, I can adopt those standards that the federal government has said would be consistent with the needs of law enforcement officials and maybe I can make some money by marketing to people who are interested in actually being safer, but all of that is an open question and a question that will ultimately be determined by the free market. But it certainly is a question that's been answered in the affirmative by the free market in just about every other product imaginable.\nQ: Lastly, let me ask you about Puerto Rico. You and I spoke yesterday about the ticking of the clock. May 1st is around the corner now. Can you discuss the restructuring of the debt effort that is ongoing for Puerto Rico and the possibility that American taxpayers can end up having to if not be on the hook for the problems there, responsible for trying to mitigate the damage?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the problem right now, Kevin, is that the government of Puerto Rico does not have the authority that they need to effectively restructure their debt. The kind of authority that the federal government has proposed giving the Puerto Rican government is the kind of restructuring authority that's available to cities all across the country. So this is not a strategy that had to be designed from scratch -- there's a template for giving the government the authority that they need -- the local government the authority that they need to restructure their debt.\nNow, what's also true is the Obama administration, at least, is interested in making sure that that restructuring authority is paired with a commitment on the part of the Puerto Rican government to implement long-overdue economic, financial and fiscal reforms. And we should write into the law oversight that ensures the Puerto Rican government makes good on their commitment to implement those reforms.\nQ: So where are we in the process then? Because May 1st is around the corner.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, where we are in the process is that now for 191 days we've seen Republicans in Congress fail to act on the common-sense proposal that the administration put forward back on October 21st. And that delay has allowed the situation in Puerto Rico to only get worse. And that's why the case that I've made is that Republicans who are falsely suggesting that the proposal that I've outlined is a bailout. That's wrong; it's not a bailout. But the more they delay, and the more that Republicans drag their feet, the more likely it is that a bailout becomes the only option. So it's irresponsible for Republicans to be handling this in the way that they have thus far. Frankly, their false accusations only further gum up the process in a way that makes the worst possible outcome even more likely.\nQ: Any chance that there will be work on this over the weekend? Because between now and Monday, something has got to give.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there have been extensive conversations already between administration officials, mostly at the Treasury Department, and officials on Capitol Hill. Obviously Puerto Rican officials have been involved in this, too. Look, this is an island that is inhabited by 3 million Americans, and these are American citizens who are increasingly at risk because of the dire fiscal situation of the local government.\nSo this is where Congress has to step in and act, show some leadership, and act in a way that is not just in the best interest of the Americans in Puerto Rico, but actually act in the best interests of the 300 million Americans that live here on the mainland to make sure we're not on the hook for bailing out Puerto Rico.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, have the Russians ever responded to the U.S. complaint about the buzzing of the U.S. naval vessel?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know how the Russians responded to the concerns that were expressed by our military attachй.\nQ: Never responded?\nMR. EARNEST: I just don't know whether or not, or how the Russians communicated or responded to the concerns that we raised. But obviously those concerns were raised by the military attachй at the U.S. embassy in Moscow to his military counterpart.\nQ: Do you know if there was another complaint after the incident with a U.S. reconnaissance plane?\nMR. EARNEST: I do not know whether or not additional concerns were raised about that incident, but you could check with the Department of Defense about that.\nQ: Also, I saw that there's a movie coming out about the Obamas' first date. Do you know whether the President and First Lady have cooperated in the making of that movie?\nMR. EARNEST: I've read a little bit of the news coverage about this. It was a couple of months ago that I first saw the first story about it. I'm not aware of any cooperation on the part of the White House or the Obama family in the making of that movie, but I do know that the President and the First Lady have heard of the movie. I don't know if they've seen it.\nQ: You don't know. Could you find out?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll look into it.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, apologies if you talked about this at the beginning. On Afghanistan, with this incident in Kunduz, there was a reference at the briefing at the Pentagon that there was some combat fatigue that played a role in all this. And it made me wonder if the White House has any timeline or any update on when you're going to move from that 9,800 down to 5,500 U.S. troops.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update on our troop posture at this point. Obviously the President has laid out a strategy, one that he spoke about as recently as the end of last year. And the strategy that he's laid out is consistent with the recommendations that he's received from our military leaders, both here in Washington and on the ground in Afghanistan.\nOur men and women in uniform have two missions. The first is continuing to fight terrorism. We know there are extremist elements that could be trying to use the chaos in Afghanistan as cover to establish a safe haven there. We want to make sure that they're not able to do that. But in addition to that, our military servicemembers are also providing some advice and assistance to Afghan security forces whose capacity is only improving.\nSo those dual missions will continue, and I don't have any update at this point about whether or not a change in our posture is imminent.\nQ: Is it fair to say that the troop position is still under review as is the consideration of allowing U.S. troops more of what their requesting, in terms of leeway to engage on the battlefield?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what the President has said about this is that it is important for the broader strategic decisions that are made about things like force posture to be influenced, at least, by conditions on the ground. We need to be mindful of what's happening on the ground, even as we are making higher-level strategic decisions. That certainly is why the Commander-in-Chief gets regular updates from his military and civilian leadership at the Department of Defense about what's happening in Afghanistan.\nHe understands that as he's setting the broader strategic direction, it needs to reflect the changing situation on the ground. At this point, I'm not aware of any changes that are being contemplated with respect to the mission that our men and women in uniform are fulfilling.\nQ: On Syria, I wanted to ask you, some of the friendly groups to the U.S., rebel groups have come out and really strongly hit back, saying why isn't the White House condemning specifically the Russian build-up around Aleppo and the regime's -- what they believe were regime strikes on medical personnel and hospitals, believing that it is, to them, obvious who did it, and wondering why the White House isn't condemning it, saying that that makes you complicit in allowing this sort of thing to continue to happen.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that this particular incident about -- I'm referring to the MSF facility in Syria -- was not the result of any action taken by the United States or our coalition partners. I noted yesterday that the tactics used in that incident were consistent with tactics that we've seen used by the Assad regime in other parts of the country.\nBut at this point, I'm not aware of any analysis that has concluded definitively that the Assad regime or associated forces are directly responsible. But like I said, the early evidence that is already available indicates that it is quite similar to the tactics that have been used by the Assad regime in other places.\nAnd this administration, from the President on down, have repeatedly and forcefully condemned the immoral tactics of the Assad regime. We've noted that this blood-thirsty dictator has time and time again used the military might of that nation to attack innocent citizens. That is, in fact, why the Obama administration believes that he has lost the legitimacy to lead that country. And it's why we believe a political transition is necessary to try to bring an end to the chaos, and to try to address the series of consequences that have stemmed from President Bashar al-Assad's failed political leadership.\nQ: But the opposition sees that hedging as a defense of a broken peace and a desperate attempt to save a faltering -- didn't really even get started -- a peace process here, saying that this is some political theater; call it what it is and say directly what it is. How do you put that concern to rest?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I would say is simply that the observations that we have made are based on available information and available evidence. And there's no denying that the United States of America has, on a variety of occasions, starting at the level of the President on down, has repeatedly and forcefully condemned the attacks that the Assad regime has launched against innocent civilians.\nWhat's also true is that this administration has made reaching a political settlement and a political transition inside of Syria a top priority. There's no military solution that can be imposed successfully on Syria. The way to resolve the chaos in that country --\nQ: What if the Russians don't believe that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, actually, the Russians themselves have acknowledged that a political transition is necessary. They've indicated that they share that view. And what we have challenged the Russians to do is to use their influence with the Assad regime to get them to participate on those talks more constructively. And look, the fact that those talks convened, and the fact that there was, at least for several weeks, a cessation of hostilities that largely held, was a testament to the efforts of the United States and our ability to persuade the Russians to influence the Assad regime.\nSo this is a strategy that has shown at least a little glimmer of progress, a glimmer of hope. And that's why the administration continues to push. That's why you see the dogged engagement of Secretary Kerry in this effort. His repeated calls to Foreign Minister Lavrov and other participants in these talks are an indication that we're trying to capitalize on a very, very narrow opening. Because, as the President observed during his trip last week, all the options in Syria are bad. There are no good options there.\nSo we might as be focused on the one thing that we know can address the wide array of problems in that country, and that is seeking a political transition that would bring leadership to Syria that reflects the will and ambition of the Syrian people, that can unite that country, that can restore some order, that can be a partner of the United States and our coalition partners to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and begin to try to govern that country once again. This is long-term goal. It's not going to happen overnight. And there will be lots of starts and stops to try to achieve that end.\nBut that is the path that we're trying to carve out. And it's painstaking work, and it is -- goodness knows it's frustrating. But that is the path to an outcome that reflects the best interest of the United States, and the path to an outcome that reflects the best way to resolve a conflict that has contributed to tensions in an already volatile part of the world.\nQ: So this isn't a failure to confront on the part of the U.S. in an attempt to rescue what remains a hopeful idea but not a real political process at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the United States has willingly and forcefully condemned the immoral and bloodthirsty actions of the Assad regime. They have repeatedly used grotesque military tactics to attack innocent men, women and children. And we have forcefully condemned those actions more times than I can count.\nAnd yes, the United States has been focused on trying to bring along political talks -- and not because it's easy, but because we recognize that political talks are the best path to resolving the chaos and turmoil and violence inside of Syria.\nQ: And lastly, on North Korea. Is the U.S. open to doing what they've done in the past and perhaps entertain the idea of sending an envoy to bring back the two Americans who are now in prison there, one of them sentenced today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we have said, particularly as it relates to Mr. Warmbier, the college student who was detained in North Korea back in January, is we've called on the North Korean government to release him on humanitarian grounds so that he can be reunited with his family. Our engagement with the North Koreans has been through the Swedish government. The Swedes are our protecting power in North Korea, and we're going to continue to work through Swedish diplomats to secure the release of these American citizens.\nQ: But as for sentencing today, can you say anything about that?\nMR. EARNEST: As for the sentencing today, I don't have much to say about it. We continue to go to great lengths to try bring home Americans that we believe are wrongfully held around the world. And those efforts will continue, and those efforts in North Korea are done through our Swedish protecting power there.\nJohn.\nQ: Talking about the Zika funding, the bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, it increased discretionary caps -- $80 billion over two years, including non-defense discretionary spending, about $40 billion over the next fiscal year. Does that money give the administration any flexibility to work with appropriators to try to come up with a way to fund the emergency for Zika?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm certainly no expert when it comes to the intricacies of the congressional budget process. What I do know, and what requires no expertise to include, is that the budget process that's being run by Republicans in the House and Senate right now is totally broken. The prospects of any sort of budget agreement, even by the strong Republican majorities in the House and Senate, are basically nil -- which is why it is totally irresponsible for Republicans to suggest that this broken budget process should be pursued to meet an urgent need. Our public health professionals have called this a public health emergency. It has prompted an emergency response by the CDC and the NIH and other public health professionals all across the country. And it's time for Congress to treat it accordingly.\nDemocrats in Congress are certainly committed to addressing this emergency, but Republicans aren't. And, frankly, I don't know why. I don't know what their explanation is. There's no -- it's not as if the Zika virus only affects Democrats. Pregnant women in both parties are affected by the Zika virus and are at risk. It's time for Congress to do something to protect them.\nAnd every day that goes by that Republicans in Congress fail to act is another day lost to our efforts to prepare for this emergency. And that's the subject of intense disappointment. And it is highly irresponsible, and I don't know how Republicans who are in the majority in Congress right now are going to explain that to their constituents as they spend the next 10 days not in Congress.\nSo I don't know if these members of Congress are planning a vacation or if they're planning town hall meetings, but I suspect they're going to get some pretty direct questions from their constituents asking them why they haven't done anything to address a public health emergency. And I suspect that Republicans at some point later this summer, when the television networks and the newspapers are warning of this public health crisis, the Republicans themselves are going to be wondering why they didn't do something earlier. And I don't know what the answer to that question will be, either.\nQ: And then quickly on the White House Correspondents' Dinner. In 2011, the President really went after Donald Trump, but since then he's said that the rhetoric he's using is dangerous and it's making our allies nervous. Is Donald Trump still a laughing matter? Can he still prove to be the butt of jokes at the dinner this weekend?\nMR. EARNEST: Tune in on Saturday night and we'll all find out.\nQ: And Bernie Sanders is the only presidential candidate that will be in attendance. You said before that he would be going after his adversaries, but do you expect Democrats to also be on the receiving end?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that the President will certainly poke a little fun at himself, and I suspect a little good-natured ribbing of his friends will occur as well.\nQ: Okay. Lastly, after the party, is the President planning any sort of after-party here at the White House with his friends and supporters?\nMR. EARNEST: Not that I'm aware of, but that would be a pretty hot ticket if he were, wouldn't it?\nJohn, in the back.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I've noticed on Donald Trump a reluctance -- especially on Wednesday I noticed you wouldn't say his name. Look back and it seems to be a pattern. And when asked about some of his proposals and pronouncements, you talk about the President's record, especially on foreign policy. Why is that? And as he moves closer to being the nominee, will the White House have to change that approach?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, over the course of the last nine months or so, I've been asked frequently about presidential candidates in both parties. And I think I've been pretty candid about the fact that there are some opportunities that I've taken to weigh on that debate, but mostly I've tried to stay out of it.\nAnd I think as the general election advances, I'm going to try to fulfill what responsibilities I have here, which is to obviously help all of you understand exactly what's happening at the White House, but also to be an advocate for the President's policies and the President's values and the President's priorities. That will be the subject of some debate in the general election.\nAnd so I anticipate that I'll be asked about what some of the other candidates have to say about it. And that will be a -- I'll have to make some strategic decisions about how to most effectively make the case for the President. Obviously the President himself is going to be out there making his case too, and he'll do that here at the White House but also as he travels across the country. And it's going to be an interesting fall, I suspect.\nQ: And on Zika, Senator Blunt says the Zika gang in the Senate, they're trying to produce something that can move to final passage.\nMR. EARNEST: Is \"Zika gang\" a thing now?\nQ: I'm giving it a shot.\nMR. EARNEST: There you go. I imagine they all have, like, black leather jackets and maybe a certain color of bandana or something. \"Hey, man, we're the Zika gang.\" It's got a good ring to it.\nQ: They're trying to produce something. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Maybe it should be. I'll call Cody and let him know we have some edits.\nQ: So Senator Blunt says they're trying to produce something that can get to final passage in both chambers and the President's desk. Senator Graham, yesterday, who's part of the gang, mentioned possibly offsetting the funds, whatever additional funds that they might come up with. Is the White House open to some offsets, some or all of it? And might that be a way to pass it with a majority of the majority in the House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I don't want to prejudge the process. What I will say is the process has already been delayed for too long by Republicans who have not recognized that this needs to be a priority.\nOne of the reasons that emergency funding is typically not offset is that funding bills can often get bogged down in debates about the pay-fors. The essence of an emergency is that Congress should act quickly. So what we would like to see is Congress to act quickly, to act consistent with the urgent needs that our public health professionals say exist.\nSo if there were a way to design a package that had strong bipartisan support that could be quickly and easily resolved that included pay-fors, I wouldn't rule that out of hand. But given how long it has taken to just discuss the funding in and of itself, I find it hard to imagine a scenario in which there isn't a protracted debate about the pay-fors. That protracted debate at this point is frankly not something that we can afford.\nThe fact is there is no debating among scientists that Congress needs to act urgently so that we can prepare for this emergency. But Republicans in Congress have failed to do it, and we're going to continue to make the case that they should.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On the Garland nomination with these progressive groups starting a campaign this weekend to push for the hearing, nine states they've planned in nine days. I wanted to talk a little bit about --\nMR. EARNEST: I guess they're calling it the 9-9-9 plan, huh?\nQ: And speaking of the congressional delays, you've been speaking about --\nMR. EARNEST: It has a little ring to it, doesn't it?\nQ: It does. It's going on seven weeks since the President made this nomination. It doesn't appear like you're any closer to a hearing. And the congressional calendar, you might call it less than robust for the rest of the year. Do you view this campaign coming up as the last best shot you've got at getting a hearing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no, not necessarily. Look, I think we've made a forceful case for why Chief Judge Garland deserves to be treated fairly by the Senate. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility to offer their advice and consent of a presidential nominee.\nPresident Obama has taken that advise and consent responsibility quite seriously. The President conducted extensive negotiations and conversations with members of Congress prior to putting Chief Judge Garland's name forward. And it's not a coincidence that the President actually nominated somebody that even leading Republicans have described as a consensus nominee.\nChief Judge Garland is somebody who has served on the second-highest court in the land for 19 years. He's got more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history. He is an individual who spent his life in public service. He is somebody who has demonstrated that he understands that a judge should interpret the law, not advance a political agenda.\nThat's why it's particularly disappointing that somebody with a set of credentials and experience like this is being treated so unfairly by Republicans in the Senate. So we're going to continue to press upon Republicans and make the case that they should do what every other Supreme Court nominee since *1975[1875] has gotten, which is a hearing and/or a vote. Those are just the facts.\nAnd those arguments have gotten some traction. Certainly there's ample public evidence to indicate that Republicans' political standing has suffered as a result of the unreasonable position they've taken with respect to Chief Judge Garland's nomination. I saw some polling just yesterday that the approval rating of the Republican Party as a whole is as low as it has been since I was in high school. This is despite the fact that there are strong Republican majorities in the House and Senate in Congress.\nI think that's an indication that people aren't particularly pleased in either party by the way that Republican leaders in Washington, D.C. have handled the people's business. I think in many cases they've refused to handle the people's business. They've refused to move on emergency funding for Zika. They've refused to consider restructuring authority for Puerto Rico, despite the dire financial situation there. They've refused to even give a hearing, let alone a vote, to the President's consensus Supreme Court nominee -- consensus is a word that is often used by Republicans -- to say nothing of the budget process that Republicans have previously described as critically important and a basic function of Congress, but yet we've seen that process utterly break down in both the House and the Senate.\nSo there are some difficult questions for Republicans to answer. And certainly moving forward with fair consideration of the President's Supreme Court nominee is one way that Republicans could try to restore confidence in their ability to do the simplest, most basic thing. This is a responsibility to consider these Supreme Court nominees, it's a responsibility that's outlined in the Constitution.\nAnd the President could have chosen somebody who is outside the mainstream, somebody who is a strong progressive that has political views that are far different than any Republican senator. But that's not what he's done. He's actually chosen somebody that even Republicans have described as a consensus nominee; somebody that's demonstrated time and time again that he has what it takes to serve on the Supreme Court.\nIn fact, I made note of an op-ed that was written by Ted Olson today. Ted Olson is certainly no liberal. He's a conservative, and a widely respected legal mind, frankly on both sides of the aisle. But his conservative credentials are well-known. He wrote, \"By temperament, character and qualifications, Judge Garland is precisely the kind of jurist we want on the Supreme Court. For Republicans, there is much to recommend giving Mr. Garland a good look, a respectful hearing, and a vote on the merits.\" That's a conservative lawyer who's making that argument.\nSo this is an argument that's gotten traction. And I think the pressure on Republicans who refuse to do their job is only going to increase.\nQ: Given the calendar realities, aren't they succeeding in running out the clock on you guys?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think it is clear that they are stalling, that they aren't doing their jobs, and they're hoping that no one will notice. I think, unfortunately, they're going to be wrong about that. If they wanted to reverse course, there's still ample time for them to do so. There is no reason that Republicans couldn't act quickly to schedule a hearing, put Chief Judge Garland through his paces.\nAgain, I'm not expecting that -- I'm not suggesting or in any way expecting that Chief Judge Garland should get a pass. He should just get what every other Supreme Court nominee has gotten since 1875, and that's a fair hearing, a tough hearing. Every year since television was invented, those Supreme Court justices have gone on in front of the cameras to answer questions under oath, and those are tough questions that they've gotten from senators on both the right and the left.\nThat's all we're asking for Chief Judge Garland to get. And I think the reason that Republicans don't want to give him that venue is they're concerned that he's going to actually perform well in that venue. And that's the reason that they don't even want to invite that possibility. It would only serve to increase pressure on them to confirm his nomination.\nAnd we're going to keep the pressure up. This is a powerful argument. And the effective functioning of our Supreme Court with the full complement of justices depends on it. And that's an important thing because we know that the Supreme Court has a rather full docket next term. And they should have a full complement of justices up there to consider it.\nLet me see if I've got a week ahead here and we'll try to move on. I don't know if I have a week ahead in here. Do we not? Oh, I do. Look at this! Brian Gabriel never lets me down. (Laughter.)\nOn Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nOn Tuesday, the President will honor the 2016 National Teacher of the Year and other finalists here at the White House. The President will thank them for their hard work and dedication each and every day in the classroom.\nOn Wednesday, the President will travel to Flint, Michigan, to hear firsthand from Flint residents about the public health crisis, receive an in-person briefing on the federal efforts that are in place to help respond to the needs of the people of Flint, and deliver remarks to members of the community. Additional details about the President's travel to Michigan will be available in the coming days. That evening, the President will deliver remarks at the Asia Pacific American Institute of Congressional Studies 22nd annual awards gala dinner. That's here in Washington.\nOn Thursday, the President will host a Cinco de Mayo reception at the White House. In the afternoon, the President will be joined by the Vice President, First Lady and Dr. Biden to kick off the fifth anniversary of Joining Forces and the 75th anniversary of the USO. The event that's called \"A Celebration of Service\" will include nearly 1,500 servicemembers and their families.\nOn Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nAnd then on Saturday, the President will deliver the commencement address to the 2016 graduating class of Howard University here in Washington, D.C. As one of the nation's top historically black colleges and universities, Howard University is recognized for its rigorous education and legacy of building lasting bridges of opportunity for young people. And I know the President is certainly looking forward to giving that speech next weekend.\nSo with all of that, have a great time this weekend, everybody. And we'll see you on Monday.\nEND 2:17 P.M.

While there is evidence that the terminated staffer may have exported a summary data table, the independent investigation of Sanders campaign computers could not locate that file and no one in the Sanders campaign has ever seen that file.\nWith the investigation behind us, the campaign has withdrawn its lawsuit against the DNC today but continues to implore the DNC to address the systemic instability that remains in its voter file system. It is imperative that the DNC make it a top priority to prevent future data security failures in the voter file system, failures that only serve as unnecessary distractions to the democratic process.\nBernie Sanders Campaign Manager Jeff Weaver said \"We are gratified by the results of this independent investigation.\"", "timestamp": "2016-04-29", "title": "Press Release - Independent Investigation Confirms Sanders Campaign Told the Truth"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=118127", "text": "~President Obama Establishes Federal Interagency Reentry Council~\nAn estimated 70 million or more Americans have some kind of criminal record. Each year, more than 600,000 individuals are released from Federal and State prisons, and millions more are released each year from local jails. Promoting the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals who have paid their debt to society makes communities safer by reducing recidivism and victimization; assists those who return from prison, jail, or juvenile justice facilities to become productive citizens; and saves taxpayer dollars by lowering the direct and collateral costs of incarceration.\nProviding incarcerated individuals with job and life skills, education programming, and mental health and addiction treatment increases the likelihood that they will be successful when released. Policies that limit opportunities for people with criminal records create barriers to employment, education, housing, health care, and civic participation. All of these are critical to reducing recidivism and strengthening communities.\nAs part of National Reentry Week, the Administration has taken a series of steps to reform the federal approach to reentry by addressing barriers to reentry, supporting state and local efforts to do the same, and engaging the private sector to provide individuals who have earned a second chance the opportunity to participate in the American economy.\nToday, the President will sign a Presidential Memorandum establishing the Federal Interagency Reentry Council to lead the Government's work on the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals returning to their communities from prisons and jails. The Attorney General has successfully led a Cabinet-level working group for the last five years, and this Memorandum will build on that success and ensure that the Federal Government will continue this important work.\nThe Administration is taking important steps to reduce barriers to employment for formerly incarcerated individuals:\n• The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is publishing a proposed rule that would prohibit federal agencies from asking questions about criminal and credit history to applicants for tens of thousands of jobs in the competitive service, as well as the career senior executive service, until a conditional offer of employment has been made. People with criminal records are already eligible to compete for the vast majority of federal jobs; the proposed rule builds on current practice at many agencies by ensuring that hiring managers are making selection decisions based solely on applicants' qualifications.\nEarly inquiries into an applicant's criminal history may discourage motivated, well-qualified individuals who have served their time from applying for a federal job. Early inquiries could also lead to the disqualification of otherwise eligible candidates, regardless of whether an arrest actually resulted in charges or a conviction, and regardless of whether consideration of an applicant's criminal history is justified by business necessity. These barriers to employment unnecessarily narrow the pool of eligible and qualified candidates for federal employment, while also limiting opportunities for those with criminal histories to obtain the means to support themselves and their families.\nThe rule would also allow agencies to request exceptions where there are legitimate job-related reasons why they might need to obtain a candidate's background information sooner in the hiring process. Unless an exception is granted, only after a conditional job offer is made will candidates be asked questions about criminal and credit history that may bear on their suitability for federal employment.\n• The Presidential Memorandum directs all agencies and departments to review their procedures for conducting a suitability determination for a job applicant with a criminal record. These suitability determinations evaluate each individual's character and conduct and consider such factors as the relevance of any past criminal conduct to the job; the nature, seriousness, recency, and circumstances of any criminal conduct; the age of the individual at the time of the conduct; contributing societal conditions; and whether any efforts have been made toward rehabilitation.\n• The Presidential Memorandum directs all agencies with discretion to grant or deny occupational licenses to revise their procedures, consistent with the need to protect public safety, to ensure that a criminal record is not an automatic disqualifier and that the determination to grant or deny a licenses is made after consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.\nEngaging the Private Sector and Honoring Champions of Change\nThe President continues to call on members of the private sector to improve their communities by creating a pathway to a job for a formerly incarcerated individual. On April 11th, the White House hosted 19 companies to launch the Fair Chance Business Pledge, including American Airlines, Busboys and Poets, The Coca-Cola Company, Facebook, Georgia Pacific, Google, Greyston Bakery, The Hershey Company, The Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System, Koch Industries, Libra Group, PepsiCo, Prudential, Starbucks, Uber, Under Amour/Plank Industries, Unilever and Xerox.\nIn the two weeks since these initial companies took the pledge, an additional 93 companies and organizations have joined the pledge, including Microsoft, Best Buy, Lyft, Kellogg Company, Staples, TrueBlue, the Oklahoma City Thunder, Catholic Charities USA, NAACP, Manufacturing Alliance of Philadelphia, American Civil Liberties Union, the American Sustainable Business Council and dozens of small and medium-sized companies from across the country.\nTogether, these 112 companies and organizations employ well over 1.5 million people. By joining the pledge, they are committing to take action to reduce barriers to a second chance, such as \"banning the box,\" ensuring information regarding a criminal record is considered in the proper context, and engaging in hiring practices that do not unnecessarily place jobs out of reach for those with criminal records. Companies and organizations interested in joining the pledge can continue to do so by visiting www.whitehouse.gov/fairchancepledge.\nThis past Wednesday, the White House honored 10 individuals as \"White House Champions of Change for Expanding Fair Chance Opportunities.\" These individuals were recognized for their leadership and tireless work to remove barriers to a second chance for those with a criminal records.\nAdditional Federal Agency Actions To Reduce Barriers During National Reentry Week\nAs part of National Reentry Week, the Federal Interagency Reentry Council agencies have announced additional steps to improve the rehabilitation and reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals:\n• The Council of Economic Advisors released a report, \"Economic Perspectives on Incarceration and the Criminal Justice System,\" and hosted an event with the Brennan Center for Justice and the American Enterprise Institute focused on the economic impact of the criminal justice system and identified cost-effective ways to reduce crime and incarceration rates.\n• The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its \"Roadmap to Reentry,\" outlining five evidence-based principles of reform to be implemented by the Bureau of Prisons to ensure DOJ's commitment to reentry is incorporated throughout incarceration - from intake to release.\n• Attorney General Lynch sent a letter to governors asking them to allow individuals reentering the community to exchange their corrections identification card for a state identification cards or to accept a corrections identification card as a form of identification. The lack of state-issued identification is another common barrier in getting a job, housing, or opening a bank account.\n• The U.S. Attorneys' Offices and Bureau of Prisons are hosting hundreds of events in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including job fairs and resource fairs, mock interview sessions, resume workshops, family engagement events.\n• The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released guidance on the application of Fair Housing Act standards to the use of criminal records by providers of housing and guidance for public housing authorities on excluding the use of arrest records in housing decisions.\n• HUD and DOJ announced recipients of $1.75 million in grants for Public Housing Authorities and nonprofit legal service organizations to assist young people residing in public housing or who would be residing in public housing but for their criminal record.\n• The Department of Health and Human Services released guidance clarifying that individuals in state or local halfway houses and those on probation or parole are not excluded from Medicaid and describing how states can better facilitate access to Medicaid services for individuals reentering the community.\n• The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is participating in 120 events at Bureau of Prison facilities and VA medical centers to serve justice-involved Veterans. VA's Veterans Justice Outreach initiative is active in over 350 Veterans Treatment Courts and other Veteran-focused court programs and 1,284 local jails.", "timestamp": "2016-04-29", "title": "Fact Sheet: During National Reentry Week, Reducing Barriers to Reentry and Employment for Formerly Incarcerated Individuals"}
{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120892", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: Hey! (Applause.) How is everybody doing? You guys been hanging out at the White House? Have they been treating you well? You guys good? You guys comfortable?\nAUDIENCE: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: We heard you up there jamming. It was a good way to start the morning. So welcome to the White House, everybody. I hope everybody is treating you well.\nI want to start by thanking the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, as well as the folks at UNESCO, and so many others who have made this day possible. This is going to be a really good day, and we're starting it out with you guys. You look so handsome.\nI want to thank our incredible artists who are with us. We've got Herbie Hancock, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Bobby Watson, and Terence Blanchard. (Applause.) And we're also going to have a group of amazing students who are studying jazz at UCLA. Where are the students? You look like grown people. (Laughter.) Doesn't look like students.\nWell, welcome, welcome. It's great to have you all here. Thank you so much. You know, this is a busy day, and the fact that these guys are taking this morning to be with you when they're going to be playing all through the night is a real testament to how excited they are for our young generation -- you guys. And you guys are really the star of the show today.\nSo we welcome students who are here from high schools from the D.C., Virginia and Maryland areas. Are you guys all studying music, or are you just sort of hanging out at the White House? (Laughter.) So I hope this is as exciting a day for you as it is for me.\nToday, we aren't just celebrating a uniquely American art form, we're also honoring the history and the people who shaped the art form into what it is today. And that history goes way back. As many of you know, if you were students of jazz, it unfolded in smoky dance halls in New Orleans and in clubs in Harlem, and in simple shacks all throughout the South where African American artists drew on our nation's diverse cultural heritage to invent a new kind of sound. And it's a blend of irresistible rhythms and irrepressible creativity, but jazz is also described as America's greatest contribution to the arts.\nBut of course, while the music may have started here in America, in years since, it's truly become a globally inspired piece of work. Jazz is now performed and treasured by folks of every background in just about every part of the world.\nSo to honor and help continue this proud legacy, today, we are celebrating the fifth annual International Jazz Day. (Applause.) And we've been working on getting this done for a little bit, so I am thrilled that this is happening, that Washington, D.C. was selected as the host city this year. And we are so excited to be putting on just a big, huge jazz concert here at the White House tonight. You saw that -- I won't call it a tent, because it's more like a structure that's on the South Lawn where the concert is going to be held.\nThis show is just one of thousands of performances and celebrations happening all across the globe, in 190 countries on six continents today. So it turns out that just about everybody loves jazz, right? (Laughter.) And I am absolutely no exception.\nI grew up in a jazz household. Everybody knows I grew up on the South Side of Chicago. I tell this story always because truly, jazz was the music I was raised on. My mother's father, my grandfather -- who we called \"Southside\" -- now that's a jazz-lover's name. (Laughter.) Southside was a carpenter, and he built a makeshift jazz studio in his little two-bedroom house where all the kids -- my mother came from a big family of seven brothers and sisters. But this was a two-bedroom house. He had a wall of jazz. He had mismatched turntables, a reel-to-reel, and he connected speakers into every room in the house. I mean, literally, that was surround sound before we even knew what it was. (Laughter.) They weren't all the same brands; some speakers were found in the alley, some speakers were given to him.\nBut my grandfather would wake up every single morning and he would turn on jazz. And he would blast it at the highest possible volume that he could get away with. So I really grew up with jazz as kind of the backdrop to my childhood. We'd all gather at his house -- and whether we were unwrapping Christmas presents, it was Miles Davis playing. If it was a birthday celebration, it was Charlie Parker. I just came to grow up loving jazz. My father was a jazz lover, and of course, I married a man who was a jazz lover, too, the President of the United States, who is looking forward to tonight.\nSo jazz has really fueled my life in ways that I can't describe. It just generates all these memories for me from my childhood. And all these years later, to have the world's greatest jazz musicians play a concert in our backyard -- and I do mean \"our,\" the nation's backyard -- on Duke Ellington's birthday, no less, is really kind of an amazing full-circle moment for me and I know for so many people.\nAnd I'm especially thrilled to share this passion with so many D.C. students on D.C.'s College Signing Day, which is why everybody is wearing their college gear. For those of you who don't know what College Day is, this is the day that a lot of students declare where they're going to college. You guys look awesome in your gear. It's a good thing. And I have a college-bound student who will be declaring soon.\nBut I think that it just means a lot. It's a perfect combination to be celebrating College Signing Day with International Jazz Day. Because no matter what you want to do in your life -- whether it's to be a jazz musician or an entrepreneur or a scientist or a teacher -- you're going to need a good education. And everybody on this stage understands that. You are going to need to get an education beyond high school.\nAnd at the same time, we also know the power of bringing the arts into our schools. And I can't say this enough here, but the arts cannot be an option for our kids. It's got to be a necessity, just like math and science and reading, and all that kind of stuff. Arts has to be a part of that, because we know that students who get involved in things like music or drama or visual arts, they just do better. The studies are clear. They have better grades, they have better graduation rates, they have better college enrollment rates.\nMusic and arts is a foundation for an outstanding education. And that's why, as soon as we got to the White House, we started hosting these workshops during the day when we would have music series in the evenings. We actually kicked things off in 2009 with a jazz workshop. That was the very first workshop that we did. And since then, we have celebrated every art form, music form, from ballet to country music to gospel to Broadway. And every single time, we bring kids here, like you guys, to spend time with the talent, who takes their mornings on a busy day to be with you all.\nSo we're grateful to have you. And at every event, we've highlighted the transformative power of education, because if you complete your education past high school, there is really nothing that you can't do. But we emphasize this because a high school diploma these days is not enough, but a four-year [college] isn't the only thing you need to do. There are many ways to get that education, whether it's a four-year school, a two-year community college, a training program, what have you. But high school is not enough. And that's the message that we send to kids as much as we can, and to families, to understand the importance that education has in young people's lives.\nThe lives of the musicians on this stage are a testament to that truth. Bobby Watson started his career in the world-famous jazz program at the University of Miami. And I hope they all talk about their experience. Dee Dee Bridgewater began touring internationally with the University of Illinois Big Band. Terence Blanchard got his big break with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers while he was a student at Rutgers. And then there's Herbie Hancock, this young man here. I think he's still about 25 or something. So he's a prodigy. But he arrived as a freshman at Grinnell College. And when he got to school, he was torn between his passions for music and for electrical engineering. Okay, so let's just stop there. (Laughter.)\nAnd even after he decided to be a musician, he used his engineering background to experiment with electronic instruments to create whole new landscapes of sound. Today, as you all should know, if you are real students of jazz, he is one of the most influential jazz pianists and composers in history, with 14 Grammys to his name. Just saying. (Laughter.)\nAnd I think that Herbie's story illustrates an important point -- that while the folks on this stage are now legends, they spent plenty of long years really mastering the fundamentals first. And the same, hopefully, will be true for all of you.\nFor those of you who want to be musicians, that means that before you can improvise and do those solos, you've got to practice those scales. You've got to understand music theory. You've got to get down to the nuts and bolts before you can do this. If you want to be something else -- if you want to be a teacher or a doctor or a lawyer, or President of the United States -- you've got to buckle down in class. Which means when you get to college, you've got to blow it out. You've got to take your classes seriously -- which means go to class every day, which sometimes feels like an option when you're in college, if we all remember. But you need to go to class. You need to take good notes. You need to raise your hand. You need to be focused in school -- because you're paying for it. So you're going to feel the pain when you leave, so you might as well get your money's worth.\nAnd I want you all to throw yourselves into all the activities that campus life brings, if you're going to campus -- which means join clubs, be involved in extracurricular activities. Don't sit in your dorm room alone. That is not the college experience. You're not supposed to get through college on your own, so you got to break out.\nAnd the most important thing I tell young people headed to college is ask for help. Do not be afraid to ask for help. That is the thing that dooms college students. They think they should do it all alone. And no one gets through college or anything in life without a whole lot of help. So the minute you start feeling a little out of sorts, the minute you feel like you're falling behind, you don't think you understand something in class, there are a whole array of people who are there to help you, from counselors to RAs to tutoring centers -- you name it. But you've got to find them. They're not going to come looking for you. That's the difference in college. They expect you to be grown up and identify your needs and go after it, okay?\nBut if you guys do all of that, the sky is the limit. You can be great musicians, you can be legends in your own time. You can be the President of the United States. You can do whatever you want. This stuff isn't rocket science. Well, to be what they're -- you have to have some talent. (Laughter.) It's like, I can't do anything these can people do. But you all can do what I do, if you choose to.\nSo I hope that you use this time here to really ask questions. Don't be nervous. When I leave, the press will leave so you'll be okay. (Laughter.) Ask questions. Get the wisdom from these folks. They are here for you. We are here for you all. And have some fun along the way.\nAnd to all our students going to college, I wish you all the very, very best of luck. You got a President and a First Lady who are behind you all every step of the way. Just remember, when you hit a barrier, that's when you grow. So don't let that shut you down -- because we've all had our trials and tribulations. We've all failed big in some way, shape or form. The question isn't whether you fail, it's how you get up and move on. So keep it up, all right? Until then, just have a good time here this morning, all right?\nAnd with that, I'm going to go do some more work. But I'm going to turn it over to Herbie Hancock and our musicians who are going to take it away for you guys. All right? Thank you so much.

These individuals were chosen from more than 900 nominations. The event will feature remarks by White House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell, and Director of National Drug Control Policy Michael Botticelli. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy will host a discussion with Allison Janney, Emily Osment, and Chuck Lorre from the Warner Bros. Television-produced CBS comedy series Mom.\nAs part of today's event, and in coordination with the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 191 schools of nursing at the academic institutions listed below announced that beginning in fall 2016 they will require their advanced practice registered nursing students to take some form of prescriber education by the time they graduate, in line with the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. Also today, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy announced that 54 colleges and schools of pharmacy will educate all their students about life-saving overdose interventions, including how to counsel patients and others on the appropriate use of naloxone.\nAs detailed below, the Federal Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force is holding its first meeting today to advance access to treatment and promote compliance with health coverage parity implementation. Tomorrow the Drug Enforcement Administration will hold its 11th National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, providing a safe, convenient, and responsible way of disposing of unneeded prescription drugs — including opioids and other controlled substances — in communities across the country.\nTo address the national prescription opioid and heroin overdose epidemic, the Administration has been working to expand the use of tools that are effective in reducing drug use and overdose. These include evidence-based prevention programs, prescriber education, prescription drug monitoring, safe drug disposal, medication-assisted treatment, and the overdose reversal drug naloxone.\nLast month, President Obama joined nearly 2,000 individuals in recovery, family members, medical professionals, law enforcement officials, and other leaders at the National Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit. There he announced  new public and private sector actions and reiterated his call to Congress for  $1.1 billion in new funding to help every American with an opioid use disorder who wants treatment get the help they need.\nThe Champions of Change for Advancing Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery\nAnita Bradley – Cleveland, Ohio\nAnita Bradley is the founder and Executive Director of the Northern Ohio Recovery Association.

Anita also recently launched a Statewide Network for Addiction to respond to the opioid crisis and ensure that the voice for recovery from substance use disorders is included in planning and policy efforts in Ohio. Anita was named winner of the 2015 Women Who Excel Entrepreneur Award by Smart Business Magazine and is a recipient of the Joel Hernandez Community Recovery Award.\nLeonard Campanello – Gloucester, Massachusetts\nLeonard Campanello is the Chief of Police in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Chief Campanello has worked to end the stigma of addiction by adding law enforcement's voice to those suffering with substance use disorders. In May 2015, in response to the growing epidemic of opioid use disorders, he announced a policy change that allows those with substance use disorders to ask for help and treatment resources from the Gloucester Police Department by walking into the station, with or without drugs, and without being charged with a crime. The policy also provided free naloxone (the opioid overdose reversal drug) for anyone in need. In the 10 months since it began, the Gloucester Program reports that it has brought 425 people directly to treatment with no criminal penalty and no solicitation of information, and has reduced crime and costs associated with substance use disorders in Gloucester and rebuilt the trust between the police and the community. The policy's success led to the creation of the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative, which facilitates the proliferation of the Gloucester Program to over 100 communities in 22 States and partnerships with 250 treatment centers and growing.\nLeslie Hayes – Espaсola, New Mexico\nLeslie Hayes, MD, works for El Centro Family Health in Espanola, New Mexico, as a family practitioner.

for clinicians on appropriate prescribing, including determining if and when to start prescription opioids for chronic pain treatment; guidance on medication selection, dose, and duration, including when to discontinue medication, if needed; and guidance to help assess the benefits and risks and address the harms of prescription opioid use.\nAlso today, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy announced that 54 colleges and schools of pharmacy will educate all their students about life-saving overdose interventions, including how to counsel patients and others on the appropriate use of naloxone.

The President established the Task Force last month to advance access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment and promote compliance with mental health and substance use disorder parity implementation. Federal parity protections are intended to ensure that health plans' coverage of mental health and substance use disorder benefits is comparable to their coverage of medical and surgical benefits.\nNational Prescription Drug Take-Back Day\nTomorrow, the Drug Enforcement Administration will hold its 11th National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, providing a safe, convenient, and responsible way of disposing of unneeded prescription drugs — including opioids and other controlled substances — in communities across the country. More than 5.5 million pounds of medication have been collected over the last ten Take Back Days.\nLocal communities are also establishing ongoing drug take-back programs, and to support these efforts, Walgreens is installing safe medication disposal kiosks in more than 500 drugstores across the country, primarily at locations open 24 hours.\nBackground on Administration Actions on Opioids\nIn October 2015, as part of his visit to West Virginia to discuss the prescription opioid abuse and heroin epidemic, the President  announced a number of new public and private sector actions, including a Presidential Memorandum requiring Federal Departments to provide training on appropriate opioid prescribing to Federal health care professionals and requiring Departments to develop plans to address barriers to opioid use disorder treatment in Federal programs. Departments are ahead of schedule in fulfilling the President's directive that Federal agencies ensure that all employees who prescribe these drugs are trained in appropriate opioid prescribing practices by 2017. In addition, since the President's Memorandum was released, Departments have taken numerous steps to expand access to opioid use disorder treatment, including medication-assisted treatment.\nFor example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently issued a proposed rule to increase the current patient limit for qualified physicians who prescribe buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorders from 100 to 200 patients with the goal of expanding access to this evidence-based treatment while preventing diversion. The proposed rule aims to increase access to medication-assisted treatment and behavioral health supports for thousands of people with opioid use disorders.\nHHS also released $94 million in new funding to 271 Community Health Centers across the country earlier this month to increase substance use disorder treatment services, with a specific focus on expanding medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorders in underserved communities. This funding is expected to help health centers treat nearly 124,000 new patients with substance use disorders.\nEarlier this week,  HHS issued new guidance to give as many as 96,000 Americans transitioning from incarceration back to their communities access to health care through Medicaid, including mental health and substance use disorder treatment. Historically, the vast majority of justice-involved individuals have been uninsured, and roughly half of incarcerated individuals struggle with mental health conditions and substance use disorder. Uninterrupted access to health care coverage can help lower health care costs, hospitalizations and emergency department visits, as well as the risk of re-incarceration.\nThese actions build on efforts that began in 2010 when the President released his first National Drug Control Strategy, which emphasized the need for action to address opioid use disorders and overdose while ensuring that individuals with pain receive safe, effective treatment. In 2011, the White House released its national Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan, which outlined goals for addressing prescription drug abuse and overdose.\nSince then, the Administration has supported and expanded efforts to prevent drug use, pursue \"smart on crime\" approaches to drug enforcement, improve prescribing practices for pain medication, increase access to treatment, work to reduce overdose deaths, and support the millions of Americans in recovery.\nThe Champions of Change program was created as an opportunity for the White House to feature individuals doing extraordinary things to empower and inspire members of their communities. The event will be streamed live on www.whitehouse.gov/live. To learn more about the White House Champions of Change program, visit www.whitehouse.gov/champions.

As one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse groups in America, the AAPI community reminds us that though we all have distinct backgrounds and origins, we are bound in common purpose by our shared hopes and dreams for ourselves and our children. Our Nation's story would be incomplete without the voices of countless Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders who have called the land we all love home. This month, we honor the irreplaceable roles they have played in our past, and we recommit to ensuring opportunities exist for generations of AAPIs to come.\nThe AAPI community's long and deeply-rooted legacy in the United States reminds us of both proud and painful chapters of our history. Confronted with grueling and perilous working conditions, thousands of Chinese laborers on the transcontinental railroad pushed the wheels of progress forward in the West. Japanese American troops fought for freedom from tyranny abroad in World War II while their families here at home were interned simply on the basis of their origin. And many South Asian Americans in particular face discrimination, harassment, and senseless violence often in the communities in which they live and work.\nToday, AAPIs lend their rich heritage to enhancing our communities and our culture. As artists and activists, educators and elected officials, service men and women and business owners, AAPIs help drive our country forward. Yet despite hard-won achievements, AAPIs continue to face obstacles to realizing their full potential. One in three AAPIs does not speak English fluently, and certain subgroups experience low levels of educational attainment and high levels of unemployment. AAPIs also often experience heightened health risks, and millions of AAPI men, women, and children in the United States live in poverty.\nMy Administration is committed to supporting and investing in AAPI communities. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 20 million uninsured adults have gained health insurance coverage, including 2 million AAPIs. Among Asian Americans under the age of 65, the uninsured rate has declined by 55 percent since 2013. Last year, we brought together thousands of AAPI artists; advocates; and business, community, and Federal leaders from across America for the first-ever White House Summit on AAPIs to discuss the key issues facing their communities. The Summit was hosted by the White House Initiative on AAPIs, which I reestablished during my first year in office and is housed within the Department of Education. We are working with Federal agencies to build stronger and more robust regional networks across our country that improve access to Federal resources and expand opportunities. We have worked to protect civil rights, foster educational equity, and create economic opportunity across our country. Because a lack of detailed data perpetuates the false notion of AAPIs as a model minority, we are working across Government to improve data collection to counter existing stereotypes and to shed light on the realities faced and resources needed by the AAPI community. Through the White House Task Force on New Americans, Federal agencies are working with cities and counties around America to build welcoming communities that allow immigrants and refugees to thrive. And we will continue working to allow more high-skilled immigrants to stay in our country—too many talented AAPIs are held back from fully realizing our country's promise, and too many have suffered the consequences of our Nation's broken immigration system.\nPeoples of diverse backgrounds and circumstances have long come to our country with the faith that they could build a better life in America, and spanning generations, the story of AAPIs in the United States embodies this promise. During Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, let us celebrate the many contributions our AAPI brothers and sisters have made to the American mosaic, and let us renew our commitment to creating more opportunities for AAPI youth as they grow up and embrace the hard work of active citizenship, adding their unique voices and experiences to our Nation's narrative.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to visit www.WhiteHouse.gov/AAPI to learn more about our efforts on behalf of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-29", "title": "Proclamation 9434—Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, 2016"}

From high-rises that form our cities' skylines to ranch homes that blanket the countryside, our buildings offer places to gather and perform daily activities, and they must have sound, secure, and resilient structures. During National Building Safety Month, we recognize and pay tribute to those who ensure the safety and resilience of our Nation's buildings, and we reaffirm our commitment to upholding and abiding by strong and effective building safety standards.\nMaintaining the safety and resilience of our homes and buildings is imperative. By using disaster-resistant building codes and standards, resilient construction materials, and safe and performance-based design methods, we can safeguard the workplaces, houses, schools, and other facilities that provide us with space to grow, live, and learn. Americans can also take steps to secure buildings before natural disasters strike by elevating properties where necessary, anchoring furniture and other materials, reinforcing doors, and covering windows. I encourage everyone to visit www.Ready.gov to learn about more ways to keep yourself and those around you safe in your homes and businesses.\nThe Federal Government is leading by example. To prepare for natural disasters, I have signed Executive Orders that strengthen the security of Federal buildings and assets and improve their resilience to floods and earthquakes, reduce the risks of harm to people, lower recovery costs, and make it easier for communities to recover faster and emerge stronger. Later this month, the White House will bring together collaborators from the public and private sectors at a Conference on Resilient Building Codes. This event will underscore the critical role building codes play in ensuring community resilience, and it will strengthen our national commitment to advancing resilience in the built environment, from codes and standards to building design and construction.\nThe consequences of natural disasters can be exacerbated by the effects of a changing climate—including through stronger storms and longer wildfire seasons—so it is crucial that we ensure our buildings are resilient to the impacts of climate change. My Administration has worked with communities to build climate-resilient infrastructure to prepare for the impacts of climate change that we can no longer prevent, and we are continuing to invest in energy efficiency in our buildings.\nAll people deserve to feel safe in the buildings we inhabit day in and day out. With care and attention, we can secure and protect the places we spend time in. This month, let us take action to safeguard America's homes, schools, and other buildings, and let us ensure those responsible for this important work have the tools and resources they need.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as National Building Safety Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, businesses, nonprofits, and other interested groups to join in activities that raise awareness about building safety. I also call on all Americans to learn more about how they can contribute to building safety at home and in their communities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-29", "title": "Proclamation 9435—National Building Safety Month, 2016"}

This month, we celebrate our Nation's older citizens, and we show our appreciation for all they have done to enrich our communities and drive America forward.\nOlder Americans have unique knowledge and a breadth of insights that are tremendous assets to our country—and our seniors are eager to impart the wisdom learned from their experiences. Across our country, older Americans work and volunteer in their communities, challenging younger Americans' ambitions for what they can hope to achieve in their golden years. We must maximize the contributions of our seniors and ensure they have the resources and support they need to thrive and to keep shaping the future of the country they love.\nThe population of the United States is transforming rapidly. Within the next 13 years, more than one in five Americans will be of retirement age, and our Nation must make it a priority to ensure they are able to retire and live with dignity and respect. I remain committed to strengthening Medicare and Social Security—hallmark programs that enabled an entire generation of older Americans to live with stability and security. Aging affects us all, and I am dedicated to empowering more of today's seniors and future seniors. In 2014, I launched myRA, a new type of savings bond that allows more of our people to save for retirement. And earlier this year, I was proud to sign a reauthorization of the Older Americans Act—providing critical support for the services seniors depend on to maintain their health and independence.\nOur country has an obligation to make sure older Americans can enjoy the opportunities that come with aging, and my Administration is committed to supporting our seniors. Last summer, we held the White House Conference on Aging, where we announced our plans to modernize Federal rules affecting older Americans, improve access to workplace—based retirement plans, and better utilize technology to enrich the lives of older Americans. We launched www.Aging.gov—a resource for government-wide information for older adults to lead independent and fulfilling lives. And we have proposed updating quality and safety requirements for thousands of nursing homes, making it easier for homebound individuals to get nutritional assistance, and training more prosecutors to combat elder abuse.\nOne of the best measures of a country is how it treats its older citizens. During Older Americans Month, let us pay tribute to the men and women who raised, guided, and inspired us, and let us honor their enduring contributions to our society by safeguarding their rights and the opportunities they deserve.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as Older Americans Month. I call upon Americans of all ages to celebrate the contributions of older Americans during this month and throughout the year.

Schools help us uphold this ideal by offering a place for children to grow, learn, and thrive. During National Charter Schools Week, we celebrate the role of high-quality public charter schools in helping to ensure students are prepared and able to seize their piece of the American dream, and we honor the dedicated professionals across America who make this calling their life's work by serving in charter schools.\nCharter schools play an important role in our country's education system. Supporting some of our Nation's underserved communities, they can ignite imagination and nourish the minds of America's young people while finding new ways of educating them and equipping them with the knowledge they need to succeed. With the flexibility to develop new methods for educating our youth, and to develop remedies that could help underperforming schools, these innovative and autonomous public schools often offer lessons that can be applied in other institutions of learning across our country, including in traditional public schools. We also must ensure our charter schools, like all our schools, are of high quality and are held accountable—when a charter school does not meet high standards, we need to act in the best interest of its students to help it improve, and if that does not prove possible, to close its doors.\nCharter schools have been at the forefront of innovation and have found different ways of engaging students in their high school years—including by providing personalized instruction, leveraging technology, and giving students greater access to rigorous coursework and college-level courses. Over the past 7 years, my Administration's commitment of resources to the growth of charter schools has enabled a significant expansion of educational opportunity, enabling tens of thousands of children to attend high-quality public charter schools. I am committed to ensuring all of our Nation's students have the tools and skills they need to get ahead, and that begins with ensuring they are able to attend an effective school and obtain an excellent education.\nEducating every American student and ensuring they graduate from high school prepared for college and beyond is a national priority. This week, we honor the educators working in public charter schools across our Nation who, each day, give of themselves to provide children a fair shot at the American dream, and we recommit to the basic promise that all our daughters and sons—regardless of background or circumstance—should be able to make of their lives what they will.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1 through May 7, 2016, as National Charter Schools Week.

As outlets for creativity and ingenuity, small businesses do more than create jobs and foster growth—they represent the spirit that has always driven our Nation forward. Throughout National Small Business Week, we celebrate the irreplaceable role these enterprises play in our national life by pledging to support them and equip them with the tools and resources they need to succeed.\nAcross America, small businesses support economies, employ local residents, and contribute to the vibrancy of their communities. My Administration is dedicated to helping these businesses and the entrepreneurs who took a chance on turning ideas into realities. We have enacted 18 tax cuts for small businesses, and because of the Affordable Care Act, a tax credit of up to 50 percent is available for certain small businesses to help offset the cost of insurance. And our businesses have created jobs in every month since I signed this law.\nOur Nation does best when we help our startups and small businesses expand into new markets and offer goods and services to more people. Ninety-eight percent of the American companies that export are small and medium-sized businesses, but less than 5 percent of our country's small businesses export. In our 21st-century economy, it is imperative that we break down the trade barriers that too often hold small businesses back from extending their reach to those abroad to sell more goods made in the United States. Last year, we reached an agreement with 11 other nations that allows us to write the rules of our global economy and gives more of our people the fair shot at success they deserve. The Trans-Pacific Partnership will eliminate over 18,000 taxes imposed by other countries on our goods and services and level the playing field for American workers and businesses, and I look forward to working with the Congress to implement this agreement.\nMy Administration has taken action to ensure the Federal Government does its part to support our Nation's small businesses. During fiscal year 2015, we awarded an all-time high of more than a quarter of eligible Federal contracts to small businesses, and we made great strides in ensuring more Government contracts are given to women-owned small businesses—nearly $18 billion worth. We have launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and we have made more online tools available to entrepreneurs to give them the resources they need to start a business in a single day—and the Startup in a Day initiative is continuing to engage with all levels of government to streamline the process of beginning a business.\nOur Nation's small businesses play a critical role in generating economic prosperity, and the effort poured into them by ordinary citizens across our country reflects the hard work and determination inherent to who we are as a people. This week, we renew our support for these engines of growth and recognize their incredible contributions to our country.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1 through May 7, 2016, as National Small Business Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the contributions of small businesses to the competitiveness of the American economy with appropriate programs and activities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-29", "title": "Proclamation 9438—National Small Business Week, 2016"}

As our Nation has advanced on our journey toward ensuring rights and opportunities are extended fully and equally to all people, America's teachers—from the front lines of our civil rights movement to the front lines of our education system—have helped steer our country's course. They witness the incredible potential of our youth, and they know firsthand the impact of a caring leader at the front of the classroom.\nAs our national narrative has progressed, we have become a more equal society, cleared paths to opportunity, and affirmed the extraordinary potential of all our people—regardless of their race, their gender, their sexual orientation, their religion, or the zip code they were born into. But there is still work to be done. If our country's story is going to reflect the diversity we draw strength from, it needs to be written by people that represent the wide range of backgrounds and origins that comprise our national mosaic, and as the next generation rises and prepares to shape that narrative, our teachers will be with them every step of the way—imparting critical knowledge and opening their minds to the possibilities tomorrow holds. In working to ensure all our daughters and sons have the chance to add their voice and perspective to America's story, our teachers help shape a Nation that better reflects the values we were founded upon.\nWhen I took office, I did so with a bold vision to foster innovation and drive change within our education system, and to expand educational opportunities and outcomes for all America's learners. Central to that goal is our work to build and strengthen the teaching profession so our teachers are enabled and equipped to inspire rising generations. I have worked hard throughout my Presidency to make sure my Administration does its part to support our educators and our education system, but the incredible progress our country has seen—from achieving record high graduation rates to holding more students to high standards that prepare them for success in college and future careers—is thanks to the dedicated teachers, families, and school leaders who work tirelessly on behalf of our young people.\nJust as we know a student's circumstances do not dictate his or her potential, we know that having an effective teacher is the most important in-school factor for student success. That is why my Administration has been committed to better recruiting, preparing, retraining, and rewarding America's teachers. Following the worst economic crisis our country has seen since the Great Depression, my Administration supported significant investments in education through the Recovery Act to keep more than 300,000 educators in the classroom. We have invested more than $2.7 billion through competitive grants to better recruit, train, support, and reward talented teachers and educators, and we have worked to make sure teachers have a strong voice and a seat at the table in the policymaking process. At the urging of the Department of Education, all fifty States are advancing teacher equity plans to ensure that districts can support and retain educators in schools that need them most. In my State of the Union address in 2011, I announced a national goal to prepare 100,000 public school STEM teachers by 2021 to help ensure more of our young innovators can seize the opportunities of tomorrow—and I am proud that we are on track to meet that goal.\nI recently signed the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which ensures students are held to high standards that will better prepare them for college and careers. And because cookie-cutter solutions are not always effective considering the diversity of our communities and of the students in our classrooms, ESSA reflects my Administration's approach to education reform by empowering States and local decision makers, who know what their students need best, to shape their own progress with accountability. ESSA also aligns with the Testing Action Plan I announced last fall to help reduce the burden of standardized testing so educators can spend less time testing and more time teaching. This law will also allow more States and districts to support teachers and expand access to computer science, a critical skill our students need in the innovation economy.\nOur future is written in schools across our country. It is likely that the first person who will go to Mars is in a classroom today. Our students are our future teachers, scientists, politicians, public servants, and parents—a generation that will steer the course we will take as a people and make possible things we have not even imagined yet. We look to the women and men standing in front of classrooms in all corners of our country—from cities to reservations to rural towns—to vest America's daughters and sons with the hard skills they will need to put their dreams within reach and to inspire them to dream even bigger. On National Teacher Appreciation Day and during National Teacher Appreciation Week, let us ensure our educators know how much we value their service in the classroom, how much we appreciate all they do for our students and families, and how thankful we are for their contributions to our national progress.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 3, 2016, as National Teacher Appreciation Day and May 1 through May 7, 2016, as National Teacher Appreciation Week. I call upon students, parents, and all Americans to recognize the hard work and dedication of our Nation's teachers and to observe this day and this week by supporting teachers through appropriate activities, events, and programs.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-29", "title": "Proclamation 9439—National Teacher Appreciation Day and National Teacher Appreciation Week, 2016"}

At the birth of our Nation, our Founders fought to secure a democracy that represents the people, and the civil servants who pour everything they have into making a difference are the individuals who keep that democracy running smoothly and effectively. During Public Service Recognition Week, we honor those who dedicate themselves to ensuring America's promise rings true in every corner of our country, and we recommit to upholding the values they fight for every day.\nCivil servants demonstrate resolve and inspire optimism in sectors throughout our country. They are engineers and educators, military service members and social workers, and their individual and collective contributions drive us forward on the path toward an ever brighter tomorrow. Both at home and abroad, they carry forward the notion that as Americans, we are committed to looking out for one another and to working together to forge a bright future for generations to come. And the only way our Nation's civil service will remain at the forefront of our progress is for talented and patriotic young people to join in the effort of serving their fellow Americans—whether for 1 year or throughout their career.\nThroughout this week, we recognize the tireless efforts of the women and men who strive to make sure ours is a government that stays true to its founding ideals. With 85 percent of Federal Government jobs located outside of the Washington, D.C. area, our Federal workers, together with leaders and advocates from State and local levels, play key roles in ensuring the voices of the American people are heard. And even in the toughest of circumstances, including a politics that does not always fully recognize the value of their work, our public servants—often at great personal sacrifice—continue striving to build a better country and to bring lasting change to the lives of ordinary people across America. These selfless individuals tackle great challenges facing our country. Whether leading important scientific advances, helping homeless veterans get off the street and reclaim their lives, supporting small businesses and impoverished communities, or sustaining our environment by reducing harmful pollutants emitted into our air and waterways, these often unsung heroes make vital contributions to our country and help make our founding promise real for more people.\nThe well-being of our people depends on the passion and dedication of our workforce, and my Administration has worked to recruit, uplift, and empower exceptional civil servants. In an effort to fully realize the belief that all of us have the capacity to make a meaningful difference and contribute to our shared success, I have directed the Office of Personnel Management to begin taking action to \"ban the box\" on most Federal job applications so we are not disqualifying people with a criminal record simply because of a mistake they made in the past. Additionally, we are implementing programs that encourage Government-wide collaboration, giving workers a chance to lend and develop their talents across agencies and departments so our best ideas can flourish and grow to their fullest potential. Serving the public is not just about a paycheck—it's about contributing to the steady effort to perfect our Union over time so our democracy works for everyone. This week, let us embrace the hopeful spirit that embodies the extraordinary work of our civil servants. It is the same spirit that built America, and because of the hard work of compassionate and determined public servants, it will continue to build us up for generations to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1 through May 7, 2016, as Public Service Recognition Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the hard work and dedication of our Nation's public servants and to observe this week by expressing their gratitude and appreciation through appropriate activities, events, and programs.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-29", "title": "Proclamation 9440—Public Service Recognition Week, 2016"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This memorandum was published in the  Federal Register  on May 4.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117490", "text": "Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies\nSubject: Promoting Rehabilitation and Reintegration of Formerly Incarcerated Individuals\nAmerica is a Nation of second chances. Promoting the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals who have paid their debt to society makes communities safer by reducing recidivism and victimization; assists those who return from prison, jail, or juvenile justice facilities to become productive citizens; and saves taxpayer dollars by lowering the direct and collateral costs of incarceration. Policies that limit opportunities for people with criminal records create barriers to employment, education, housing, health care, and civic participation. This lack of opportunity decreases public safety, increases costs to society, and tears at the fabric of our Nation's communities.\nReducing the cycle of incarceration and recidivism requires coordinated action by government at all levels. Estimates are that as many as 70 million or more Americans have a record of arrest, criminal adjudication, or conviction. Each year, more than 600,000 individuals are released from Federal and State correctional facilities. Millions more are released each year from local jails. In many cases, a criminal record is an obstacle to obtaining employment or a license related to or necessary for employment. However, many individuals have criminal histories that should not automatically disqualify them from employment or licensing, but should instead be examined as part of a review of the person as a whole. Providing incarcerated individuals with job and life skills, education programming, and mental health and addiction treatment increases the likelihood that such individuals will be successful when released. And removing barriers to successful reentry helps formerly incarcerated individuals compete for jobs, attain stable housing, and support their families. All of these are critical to reducing recidivism and strengthening communities.\nIn 2011, the Attorney General formed the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, a Cabinet-level working group dedicated to the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals returning to their communities from prisons and jails. I am issuing this memorandum to ensure that the Federal Government continues the important work of this council and builds on its successes.\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:\nSection 1. Establishing the Federal Interagency Reentry Council. (a) There is hereby established the Federal Interagency Reentry Council (Reentry Council), to be co-chaired by the Attorney General and the Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council. In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Reentry Council shall include the heads of:\n(i) the Department of the Treasury;\n(ii) the Department of the Interior;\n(iii) the Department of Agriculture; (iv) the Department of Commerce;\n(v) the Department of Labor;\n(vi) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n(vii) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;\n(viii) the Department of Transportation;\n(ix) the Department of Energy;\n(x) the Department of Education;\n(xi) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n(xii) the Department of Homeland Security;\n(xiii) the Small Business Administration;\n(xiv) the Office of Management and Budget;\n(xv) the Council of Economic Advisers;\n(xvi) the Office of National Drug Control Policy;\n(xvii) the Office of Personnel Management;\n(xviii) the Corporation for National and Community Service; and\n(xix) such other executive departments, agencies, and offices as the Co-Chairs may designate.\n(b) The Co-Chairs may also invite representatives of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Trade Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Social Security Administration to participate in the activities of the Reentry Council to the extent that such activities are relevant to their respective statutory authorities and legal obligations.\n(c) As appropriate, the Co-Chairs may invite relevant representatives of the judicial branch, including representatives of the United States Probation and Pretrial Services System and Federal Public Defender Organizations, to attend and participate in meetings of the Reentry Council.\n(d) The Reentry Council shall work across executive departments, agencies, and offices (agencies) to:\n(i) within 100 days of the date of this memorandum, develop and present a Federal strategic plan to make communities safer by reducing recidivism and victimization; assist individuals who return from prison or jail to become productive citizens; and save taxpayer dollars by lowering the direct and collateral costs of incarceration;\n(ii) identify, implement, and promote evidence-based research, policies, strategies, and programming to support successful reentry and reintegration, including improved access to criminal justice data for research and evaluation purposes;\n(iii) promote regional partnerships among Federal agencies and with State, tribal, and local governments and organizations to advance local reentry and reintegration efforts;\n(iv) identify ways to improve the accuracy of records of arrest, criminal adjudication, or conviction (criminal records); and\n(v) identify and address unwarranted barriers to successful reentry.\n(e) The Reentry Council shall engage with Federal, State, local, and tribal officials, including corrections officials, as necessary to carry out its objectives. The Reentry Council shall engage with nongovernmental organizations, including those representing or composed of formerly incarcerated individuals, exonerees, victims, and criminal justice agencies, to ensure that these stakeholders have the opportunity to offer recommendations and information to the Reentry Council.\n(f) The Attorney General shall designate an Executive Director, who is a full-time officer or employee of the Federal Government, to coordinate the day-to-day functions of the Reentry Council.\n(g) The Co-Chairs shall convene a meeting of the Reentry Council at least once per year.\nSec. 2. Reducing Barriers to Employment. (a) Agencies making suitability determinations for Federal employment shall review their procedures for evaluating an applicant's criminal records to ensure compliance with 5 CFR Part 731 and any related, binding guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management, with the aim of evaluating each individual's character and conduct.\n(b) Consistent with applicable law and the need to protect public safety, agencies with statutory authority to grant or deny occupational licenses and the discretion to define the criteria by which such licensing decisions are made shall undertake to revise their procedures to provide that such licenses are not denied presumptively by reason of an applicant's criminal record in the absence of a specific determination that denial of the license is warranted in light of all relevant facts and circumstances known to the agency, including:\n(i) the nature and seriousness of the conduct resulting in the criminal record, including the circumstances surrounding the conduct and contributing societal conditions and the age of the individual at the time of the conduct;\n(ii) the time that has passed since the individual's arrest, adjudication, or conviction, or the completion of the individual's sentence, and the absence or presence of rehabilitation efforts; and\n(iii) the nature of the occupation requiring a license, including whether the criminal record is directly related to the occupation, whether the occupation offers the opportunity for the same or a similar offense to occur, and whether circumstances leading to the conviction will recur in the occupation.\n(c) Independent agencies are encouraged to comply with the requirements of this section.\nSec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, entity, office, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nSec. 4. Publication. The Attorney General is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-04-29", "title": "Memorandum on Promoting Rehabilitation and Reintegration of Formerly Incarcerated Individuals"}

In his remarks, he referred to actor Morgan Freeman.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=117465", "text": "The President. Well, good evening, everybody!\nAudience members. Good evening.\nThe President. Welcome to the White House! Good-looking crowd. For 5 years, International Jazz Day's main event has been celebrated around the world, from Istanbul to Osaka to Paris. So we couldn't be prouder that this year jazz comes back home to America. I want to thank UNESCO, its Director General, Irina Bokova, and the Thelonious Monk Institute for helping us to put on this unbelievable event. I also want to thank someone who has been a great friend to me and Michelle: UNESCO Ambassador, legendary jazz musician, and all-around cool cat, Herbie Hancock. And our emcee for the evening, who some people think has a pretty good voice, Morgan Freeman.\nIn 1964, Dizzy Gillespie ran for President—this is a true story—and he said, \"When I am elected President of the United States, my first Executive order will be to change the name of the White House to the Blues House.\" [Laughter] So tonight we're going to do right by Dizzy. We are turning this place into the Blues House. And before anybody calls this executive overreach—[laughter]—or some sort of power grab, I want to clarify that I did not issue a new Executive order. [Laughter] I just invited all my favorite jazz musicians to play in my backyard, which is one of the great perks of the job.\nI don't need to tell this crowd the story of jazz. From humble origins as the music of the Black working class, largely invisible to the mainstream, it went on to become America's most significant artistic contribution to the world. Jazz took shape in that most American of cities, New Orleans, where the rich blend of Spanish and French and Creole and other influences sparked an innovative new sound. By the early 20th century, you could walk down the street of the infamous Storyville district and—maybe as you tried to stay out of trouble—hear the likes of Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver and, of course, Louis Armstrong.\nOver the years, the sound traveled and changed: hot jazz, swing, bebop, Latin, fusion, and experiments that defied labels. But its essence has always remained the same.\nMost jazz lovers probably remember the first time this music got into our bones. Maybe it was Miles teaching us to make room for silence, to hear life in the notes that he didn't play; or how Herbie could hang our hearts on a suspended chord; or how Billie's voice, shimmering and shattered, seemed to bend time itself.\nAnd for me, that happened as a child, when my father, who I barely knew, came to visit me for about a month. And in the few weeks that I spent with him, one of the things that he did was take me to my first jazz concert, to see Dave Brubeck in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1971. And I didn't realize at the time the impact that it had, but the world that that concert opened up for a 10-year-old boy was spectacular. And I was hooked.\nMany have said that they've been hooked as well. And perhaps more than any other form of art, jazz is driven by an unmistakably American spirit. It is, in so many ways, the story of our Nation's progress: born out of the struggle of African Americans yearning for freedom; forged in a crucible of cultures, a product of the diversity that would forever define our Nation's greatness; rooted in a common language from which to depart to places unknown. It's both \"the ultimate in rugged individualism,\" to get out on stage with nothing but your instrument and improvise, spontaneously create; and the truest expression of community, the unspoken bond of musicians who take that leap of faith together. There is something fearless and true about jazz. This is truth-telling music.\nJazz is perhaps the most honest reflection of who we are as a nation. Because after all, has there ever been any greater improvisation than America itself? We do it in our own way. We move forward even when the road ahead is uncertain, stubbornly insistent that we'll get to somewhere better and confident that we've got all the right notes up our sleeve.\nAnd that's what's attracted a global audience to this music. It speaks to something universal about our humanity: the restlessness that stirs in every soul, the desire to create with no boundaries.\n\"Jazz is a good barometer of freedom,\" Duke Ellington once said. No wonder it has such an outsized imprint on the DNA of global music. It has spread like wildfire across the world, from Africa to Asia. And jazz blended with the bossa nova of Brazil or the tango of Argentina—which, from here on out, I will endeavor to appreciate as a listener and observer, rather than as a dancer. [Laughter] It can be heard in—on the Scottish bagpipe, on the Indian sitar. It opened up new exchanges with classical music and with Eastern music, and it can make the oldest folk songs sound new.\nJazz. It's always been where people come together, across seemingly unbridgeable divides. And here at home, before schools and sports, it was jazz that desegregated. Because for so many players, the only thing that mattered was the music.\nThe same was true around the world. I was recently in Cuba, the first American President to make that trip in 88 years. And in Havana, you can hear the beautiful sounds of Afro-Cuban jazz and that unlikely marriage of cultures that, a century later, still captivates us. We hope this music will lead to new avenues for dialogue and new collaborations across borders. And if we can keep faith with that spirit, there's no doubt that jazz will live on for generations to come.\nSo let me stop talking. We've got an all-star lineup of artists from around the country and around the world. Is everybody ready? Let's do this thing.

The current Democrat Governor Jerry Brown, Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, and Attorney General Kamala Harris are perhaps the most liberal group of top state officials in the country, supporting numerous failed policies that have weakened the state's economy and security. Trump backed their various electoral bids against leaders in the California Republican Party.\n\"Donald Trump has consistently financed the campaigns of some of the most liberal politicians in the country,\" said presidential candidate Ted Cruz. \"California is perhaps one of the more egregious examples. From supporting high taxes and heavy regulation to amnesty and sanctuary cities, the top three officials in California have been a disaster for the state. A number of qualified Republican candidates ran to fix California's problems, but Trump decided to back liberal Democrats against them. This is an insult to every Republican candidate, activist, official and volunteer who spent countless hours knocking doors, filling envelopes, making calls, and raising money to prevent these far-left liberal extremists from taking office. It is a betrayal to all that Republicans across California have worked for.\"\nIn 2004 and 2006, Trump helped reignite Brown's career with $3500 in donations to his campaign for Attorney General. He gave $2500 to America's most liberal mayor, Gavin Newsom, in 2009 to boost his political bid for higher office. And shockingly, Kamala Harris, the Queen of Sanctuary Cities, received $6000 from Trump in 2011 and 2013 to run as California's chief law enforcement officer. Trump has not donated to the CAGOP since 2005.\nThe results have been disastrous for California. The Golden State ranks 48th on the Tax Foundation's State Business Climate Index. Burdened by some of the highest taxes and heaviest regulations in the country, businesses and jobs are fleeing to states like Utah and Texas. California's unemployment rate remains higher than the national average.\nCalifornia's support for amnesty and sanctuary cities has encouraged lawlessness and threatened the lives of its citizens. In 2015, Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times, but was living in San Francisco, a sanctuary city. After the murder sparked national outrage, Ted Cruz introduced \"Kate's Law\" to stiffen penalties for illegal aliens reentering the country.", "timestamp": "2016-04-30", "title": "Press Release - Trump Supports Top Democrats in California"}

It's now been 45 days since I nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Judge Garland is a man of experience, integrity, and unimpeachable qualifications. Judge Garland is someone who Senate Republicans are on record saying is \"a man of accomplishment and keen intellect,\" a man who's \"honest and capable,\" a man whose \"reputation is beyond reproach.\" Those are all quotes from Republicans in the Senate.\nBut so far, most Senate Republicans have refused to even meet with Judge Garland, which means they've also refused to do their job and hold a hearing on his nomination or an up-and-down vote. But they've still found time to head home for recess over the next week.\nThis is an abdication of the Senate's responsibility. Every Supreme Court nominee since 1875 who hasn't withdrawn from the process has received a hearing or a vote. For over 40 years, there's been an average of 67 days between a nomination and a hearing. This time should be no different. This is not about partisan politics, it's about upholding the institutions that make our democracy work.\nThere's a reason Judge Garland has earned the respect of people from both political parties. As a young lawyer, he left a lucrative private firm to work in public service. He went to oversee the Federal response to the Oklahoma City bombing. For the last 19 years, Judge Garland has served on the D.C. Circuit Court, often called the second highest court in the land, and for the past 3 years, he's served as that court's Chief Judge. In fact, Judge Merrick Garland has more Federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history. With a brilliant mind, a kind spirit, and a good heart, he has dedicated his life to protecting our rights and ensuring that the voices of everyday Americans are heard.\nSo there is absolutely no reason for Republican Senators to deny him the basic courtesy of a hearing and a vote, the same courtesy that has been extended to others. This refusal to treat a Supreme Court nomination with the seriousness it deserves is what makes people so cynical about Washington. That's why poll after poll shows a majority of Americans think Senate Republicans should do their job, give Judge Garland a hearing, and give Judge Garland a vote.\nFor all of our political differences, Americans understand that what unites us is far greater than what divides us. And in the middle of a volatile political season, it is more important than ever that we fulfill our duties—in good faith—as public servants. The Supreme Court must remain above partisan politics. I've done my job. I nominated someone as qualified as Merrick Garland. Now it's time for the Senate to do their job. Give Judge Garland a hearing. Give Judge Garland an up-or-down vote. Treat him—and our democracy—with the respect they deserve.\nThanks for listening, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-04-30", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

You can't say it, but you know it's true. [Laughter]\nGood evening, everybody.\nAudience members. Good evening.\nThe President. It is an honor to be here at my last—and perhaps the last—White House Correspondents' Dinner. [Laughter] You all look great. The end of the Republic has never looked better. [Laughter]\nI do apologize. I know I was a little late tonight. I was running on C.P.T.—[laughter]—which stands for \"jokes that White people should not make.\" [Laughter] It's a tip for you, Jeff. [Laughter]\nAnyway, here we are. My eighth and final appearance at this unique event. [Laughter] And I am excited. If this material works well, I'm going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year. [Laughter] Earn me some serious Tubmans. That's right. [Laughter] That's right.\nMy brilliant and beautiful wife Michelle is here tonight. She looks so happy to be here. [Laughter] That's called practice. [Laughter] It's like learning to do 3-minute planks. [Laughter] She makes it look easy now, but—[laughter].\nNext year at this time, someone else will be standing here in this very spot, and it's anyone's guess who she will be. [Laughter] But standing here, I can't help but be reflective, a little sentimental. Eight years ago, I said it was time to change the tone of our politics. In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific. [Laughter]\nEight years ago, I was a young man, full of idealism and vigor, and look at me now. [Laughter] I am gray and grizzled, just counting down the days till my death panel. [Laughter] Hillary once questioned whether I'd be ready for a 3 a.m. phone call. Now I'm awake anyway because I've got to go to the bathroom. [Laughter] I'm up.\nIn fact, somebody recently said to me: \"Mr. President, you are so yesterday. Justin Trudeau has completely replaced you. He's so handsome, he's so charming. He's the future.\" And I said, \"Justin, just give it a rest.\" [Laughter] I resented that. [Laughter]\nMeanwhile, Michelle has not aged a day. The only way you can date her in photos is by looking at me. [Laughter] Take a look.\nHere we are in 2008.\n[At this point, an image of the President and the First Lady was shown.]\nHere we are a few years later.\n[Another image was shown.]\nAnd this one is from 2 weeks ago. [Laughter] [An image of the First Lady standing beside a tuxedo-clad skeleton was shown.]\nSo time passes. [Laughter] In just 6 short months, I will be officially a lame duck, which means Congress now will flat-out reject my authority. [Laughter] And Republican leaders won't take my phone calls. And this is going to take some getting used to, it's really going to—it's a curve ball. I don't know what to do with it. [Laughter]\nOf course, in fact, for months now congressional Republicans have been saying there are things I cannot do in my final year. Unfortunately, this dinner was not one of them. [Laughter] But on everything else, it's another story. And you know who you are, Republicans. In fact, I think we've got Republican Senators Tim Scott and Cory Gardner, they're in the house, which reminds me, security, bar the doors! [Laughter] Judge Merrick Garland, come on out, we're going to do this right here, right now. It's like \"The Red Wedding.\" [Laughter]\nBut it's not just Congress. Even some foreign leaders, they've been looking ahead, anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe. [Laughter] That was a slap in the face. [Laughter] A clear breach of protocol. [Laughter] Although, while in England I did have lunch with Her Majesty the Queen, took in a performance of Shakespeare, hit the links with David Cameron—just in case anybody is still debating whether I'm Black enough, I think that settles the debate. [Laughter]\nI won't lie: Look, this is a tough transition. It's hard. Key staff are now starting to leave the White House. Even reporters have left me. Savannah Guthrie, she's left the White House Press Corps to host the \"Today\" show. Norah O'Donnell left the briefing room to host \"CBS This Morning.\" Jake Tapper left journalism to join CNN. [Laughter]\nBut the prospect of leaving the White House is a mixed bag. You might have heard that someone jumped the White House fence last week, but I have to give Secret Service credit. They found Michelle, brought her back, she's safe back at home now. [Laughter] It's only 9 more months, baby. Settle down. [Laughter]\nAnd yet, somehow, despite all this, despite the churn, in my final year, my approval ratings keep going up. [Laughter] The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major. [Laughter] And here's the thing: I haven't really done anything differently. So it's odd. Even my aides can't explain the rising poll numbers. What has changed? Nobody can figure it out. [Laughter]\n[Images were shown of Sen. R. Edward \"Ted\" Cruz and Trump Organization Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Donald J. Trump, in their capacity as Republican Presidential candidates.]\nPuzzling. Anyway, in this last year I do have more appreciation for those who have been with me on this amazing ride, like one of our finest public servants, Joe Biden. God bless him. Love that guy. I love Joe Biden, I really do. And I want to thank him for his friendship, for his counsel, for always giving it to me straight, for not shooting anybody in the face. [Laughter] Thank you, Joe. [Laughter]\nAlso, I would be remiss—let's give it up for our host, Larry Wilmore, also known as one of the two Black guys who is not Jon Stewart. [Laughter] You're the South African guy, right? [Laughter] I love Larry. And his parents are here, who are from Evanston, which is a great town.\nI also would like to acknowledge some of the award-winning reporters that we have with us here tonight: Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schreiber. [Laughter] Thank you all for everything that you've done. [Laughter] I'm just joking. As you know, \"Spotlight\" is a film, a movie about investigative journalists with the resources and the autonomy to chase down the truth and hold the powerful accountable. Best fantasy film since \"Star Wars.\" [Laughter] Look, that was maybe a cheap shot. [Laughter]\nI understand the news business is tough these days, it keeps changing all the time. Every year at this dinner, somebody makes a joke about BuzzFeed, for example, changing the media landscape. And every year, the Washington Post laughs a little bit less hard. [Laughter] Just kind of a silence there—[laughter]—especially at the Washington Post table. [Laughter]\nGOP Chairman Reince Priebus is here as well. Glad to see you that you feel that you've earned a night off. [Laughter] Congratulations on all your success. The Republican Party, the nomination process, it's all going great. Keep it up. [Laughter]\nKendall Jenner is also here. And we had a chance to meet her backstage. She seems like a very nice young woman. I'm not exactly sure what she does, but I am told that my Twitter mentions are about to go through the roof. [Laughter]\nHelen Mirren is here tonight. I don't even have a joke here. I just think Helen Mirren is awesome. [Laughter] She's awesome. [Laughter]\nSitting at the same table, I see Mike Bloomberg. Mike, a combative, controversial New York billionaire is leading the GOP primary, and it is not you. [Laughter] That has to sting a little bit. [Laughter] Although it's not an entirely fair comparison between you and the Donald. After all, Mike was a big-city mayor. He knows policy in depth. And he's actually worth the amount of money that he says he is. [Laughter]\nWhat an election season! For example, we've got the bright new face of the Democratic Party here tonight: Mr. Bernie Sanders! There he is—Bernie! Bernie, you look like a million bucks. [Laughter] Or to put it in terms you'll understand, you look like 37,000 donations of $27 each. [Laughter]\nA lot of folks have been surprised by the Bernie phenomenon, especially his appeal to young people. But not me. I get it. Just recently, a young person came up to me and said she was sick of politicians standing in the way of her dreams. As if we were actually going to let Malia go to Burning Man this year. [Laughter] It was not going to happen. [Laughter] Bernie might have let her go. [Laughter] Not us. [Laughter]\nI am hurt, though, Bernie, that you've been distancing yourself a little from me. [Laughter] I mean, that's just not something that you do to your comrade. [Laughter]\nBernie's slogan has helped his campaign catch fire among young people. \"Feel the Bern.\" [Laughter] Feel the Bern, it's a good slogan. Hillary's slogan has not had the same effect. Let's see this. [Laughter]\n[An image bearing the phrase \"Trudge up the Hill\" was shown.]\nLook, I've said how much I admire Hillary's toughness, her smarts and her policy chops, her experience. You've got to admit it, though, Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for Facebook. [Laughter] \"Dear America, did you get my poke?\" [Laughter] \"Is it appearing on your wall?\" [Laughter] \"I'm not sure I am using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.\" [Laughter] It's not entirely persuasive.\nMeanwhile, on the Republican side, things are a little more—how should we say this?—a little more loose. Just look at the confusion over the invitations to tonight's dinner. Guests were asked to check whether they wanted steak or fish, but instead, a whole bunch of you wrote in \"Paul Ryan.\" [Laughter] That's not an option, people. Steak or fish. [Laughter] You may not like steak or fish—[laughter]—but that's your choice. [Laughter]\nMeanwhile, some candidates aren't polling high enough to qualify for their own joke tonight. [Laughter]\n[An image of Republican Presidential candidate Gov. John Kasich of Ohio was shown.]\nThe rules were well-established ahead of time. [Laughter]\nAnd then, there's Ted Cruz. Ted had a tough week. He went to Indiana—Hoosier country—stood on a basketball court, and called the hoop a \"basketball ring.\" [Laughter] What else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? [Laughter] But sure, I'm the foreign one. [Laughter] That's fine.\nWell, let me conclude tonight on a more serious note. I want to thank the Washington press corps, I want to thank Carol for all that you do. The free press is central to our democracy, and—nah, I'm just kidding! You know I've got to talk about Trump! Come on! [Laughter] We weren't just going to stop there. Come on. [Laughter]\nAlthough I am a little hurt that he's not here tonight. We had so much fun the last time. [Laughter] And it is surprising. You've got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he says no? [Laughter] Is this dinner too tacky for the Donald? [Laughter] What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home, eating a Trump Steak—[laughter]—tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? [Laughter] What's he doing? [Laughter]\nThe Republican establishment is incredulous that he is their most likely nominee—incredulous, shocking. They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be President. But in fairness, he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan. [Laughter]\nAnd there's one area where Donald's experience could be invaluable, and that's closing Guantanamo. Because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground. [Laughter]\nAll right, that's probably enough. I mean, we—I've got more material.\nAudience members. More! More! More!\nThe President. No, no, I don't want to spend too much time on the Donald. Following your lead, I want to show some restraint. [Laughter] Because I think we can all agree that from the start, he's gotten the appropriate amount of coverage, befitting the seriousness of his candidacy. [Laughter]\nI hope you all are proud of yourselves. [Laughter] The guy wanted to give his hotel business a boost, and now we're praying that Cleveland makes it through July. [Laughter]\nMm-mm-mm. [Laughter] Hmm. [Laughter]\nAs for me and Michelle, we've decided to stay in DC for a couple more years. [Applause] Thank you. This way, our youngest daughter can finish up high school, Michelle can stay closer to her plot of carrots. [Laughter] She's already making plans to see them every day. Take a look. [Laughter]\n[An image of the First Lady watering the White House Vegetable Garden while suspended in midair by a cable was shown.] But our decision has actually presented a bit of a dilemma because, traditionally, Presidents don't stick around after they're done. And it's something that I've been brooding about a little bit. Take a look.\n[A video was shown.]\nThere you go. I am still waiting for all of you to respond to my invitation to connect to LinkedIn. [Laughter] But I know you have jobs to do, which is what really brings us here tonight.\nI know that there are times that we've had differences, and that's inherent in our institutional roles. It's true of every President and his press corps. But we've always shared the same goal: to root our public discourse in the truth; to open the doors of this democracy; to do whatever we can to make our country and our world more free and more just. And I've always appreciated the role that you have all played as equal partners in reaching these goals.\nAnd our free press is why we once again recognize the real journalists who uncovered the horrifying scandal and brought about some measure of justice for thousands of victims throughout the world. They are here with us tonight: Sacha Pfeiffer, Mike Rezendes, Walter Robinson, Matt Carroll, and Ben Bradlee, Jr. Please give them a big round of applause.\nOur free press is why, once again, we honor Jason Rezaian. As Carol noted, last time this year, we spoke of Jason's courage as he endured the isolation of an Iranian prison. This year, we see that courage in the flesh, and it's a living testament to the very idea of a free press, and a reminder of the rising level of danger and political intimidation and physical threats faced by reporters overseas. And I can make this commitment that as long as I hold this office, my administration will continue to fight for the release of American journalists held against their will, and we will not stop until they see the same freedom as Jason had.\nAt home and abroad, journalists like all of you engage in the dogged pursuit of informing citizens and holding leaders accountable and making our government of the people possible. And it's an enormous responsibility. And I realize it's an enormous challenge at a time when the economics of the business sometimes incentivize speed over depth; and when controversy and conflict are what most immediately attract readers and viewers.\nThe good news is, there are so many of you that are pushing against those trends. And as a citizen of this great democracy, I am grateful for that. For this is also a time around the world when some of the fundamental ideals of liberal democracies are under attack and when notions of objectivity and of a free press and of facts and of evidence are trying to be undermined or, in some cases, ignored entirely.\nAnd in such a climate, it's not enough just to give people a megaphone. And that's why your power and your responsibility to dig and to question and to counter distortions and untruths is more important than ever. Taking a stand on behalf of what is true does not require you shedding your objectivity. In fact, it is the essence of good journalism. It affirms the idea that the only way we can build consensus, the only way that we can move forward as a country, the only way we can help the world mend itself is by agreeing on a baseline of facts when it comes to the challenges that confront us all.\nSo this night is a testament to all of you who have devoted your lives to that idea, who push to shine a light on the truth every single day. So I want to close my final White House Correspondents' dinner by just saying thank you. I'm very proud of what you've done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy. And with that, I just have two more words to say: Obama out. [Laughter]\n[The President performed a \"mike drop,\" intentionally dropping his microphone to the floor.]\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2016-04-30", "title": "Remarks at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner"}
